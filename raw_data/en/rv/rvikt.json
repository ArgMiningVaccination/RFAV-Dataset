INTRODUCTION This guidance describes our cu rrent recommendations concerni ng preclinical development and testing of DNA vaccines to prev ent infectious diseases. This guidance supercedes the 1996 Points to Consider document. In addition, this guidance finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated February 2005. For the purposes of this guidance, DNA vaccines are defined as purified plasmid preparations containing one or more DNA sequences capable of inducing and/or pr omoting an immune response against a pathogen. Typically, these plasmids possess DNA sequences necessary for selection and replication in b acteria. In addition, they cont ain eukaryotic promoters and enhancers as well as transcription terminati on/-polyadenylation sequences to promote gene expression in vaccine recipients, and may cont ain immunomodulatory elements. DNA vaccines are biological products as set fort h in section 351 of th e Public Health Serv ice Act (PHS ACT) (42 U.S.C. 262) and are regulated by FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The principal regulations applicable to DNA vaccines ar e located in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 210, 211, 312, 600, 601, and 610. Other guidance documents are available from CBER and may contain informa tion that is relevant to DNA vaccines. Some of these documents are listed below and addi tional guidance documents may be found on the CBER website (http://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.ht m) or on the website of FDA's Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research (http:// www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm). Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) fo r DNA vaccines designed to prevent or treat infectious diseases should be submitted to CBER's Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR) where primary review responsibility is assigned. Pl asmid DNA products intended for non-infectious therapeutic indicat ions are not addressed in this guidance. INDs for these products should be submitted to CBER's Offi ce of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (OCTGT). 1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations FDA's guidance documents, including this guid ance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA's guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. BACKGROUND In December 1996, FDA issued a guidance document, \"Points to Consider on Plasmid DNA Vaccines for Preventive Infectious Disease Indica tions,\" (1996 Points to Consider document) to assist the developers of DNA vaccines. That document delineated the manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical issues relevant to the development of DNA vaccines, and described potential safety concerns that we, CBER, recommended vaccine de velopers address prior to the initiation of phase 1 clinical studies. Th e recommendations involving DNA vaccine manufacture and testing provided in that document were ba sed on our experiences with other types of vaccines and DNA-based products, including gene therapy agents. In the intervening years, we have permitted th e initiation of phase 1 clinical studies of DNA vaccines for a number of infectious disease indica tions including malaria, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The initiation of phase 1 clinical studies is predicated on the manufacturers and/or sponsors of vaccine c linical studies documenting the quality and consistency of plasmid manufacture, combined with extensive preclinical safety studies. Considerable preclinical a nd clinical experience on plasmid DNA vaccines has been accumulated since the issuance of the 1996 Points to Consider document. This experience has been taken into consideration in revising our re commendations concerning preclinical testing of DNA vaccines. III. MANUFACTURING ISSUES The following sections describe the manufacturing information that should be provided for new DNA vaccine products for clinical st udy under an IND (21 CFR Part 312). A. Product Manufacture You should describe in the manufactur ing summary all components used during manufacture as well as those present in the final product. You should provide detailed descriptions of the plasmid construction, in cluding the source and diagrams of all plasmids used, and all intermediate reco mbinant DNA cloning procedures. You should provide the DNA sequence of the entire plasmi d present in the Master Cell Bank (MCB) along with an annotated se quence identifying all open r eading frames including any unexpected open reading frames and/or other sequence elements. During intermediate 2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations steps in the production process, various me thods can be used for identity testing, including restriction enzyme mapping and pol ymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, complete sequencing of the bulk plasmid vaccine is prefered. You should describe the genotype, source of th e bacterial cells, and the procedures to construct master and working cell banks used for production. Specific guidance for the establishment of MCBs and Working Cell Ba nks (WCBs) is described in CBER's \"Points to Consider in the Characterization of Cell Lines Used to Produce Biologicals (1993).\" You should test both the MCBs and WCBs to ensure that they are free from bacteriophage and other adventitious agent contamination. We recommend that you establish the genetic stability of the plasmid DNA in the WCB. The description of the manufacturing process shou ld be sufficiently detailed to enable an assessment of the safety of the product. If lo ts produced for preclinical safety studies are manufactured differently from lots propos ed for clinical use, you should clearly document these manufacturing changes. B. Bulk Plasmid Product Release Testing If the bulk and final product are the same (i.e., if producti on runs yield one lot and no further steps in formulation are performed) , then testing as described below may be redundant and unnecessary. You should test bulk plasmid products for the properties described below, and you should use standard assay(s) of adequate specificity and sensitivity. It is understood th at in the early stages of pr oduct development, these assays may utilize a research grade internal standa rd. You should evaluate assay methods by testing known amounts of reference materials or spiked samples, or by other appropriate measures, and submit to CBER data documenting assay performance. In addition to bulk and final product release test ing, we recommend that you also perform in-process testing to ensure manufacturing consistency and product safety. Prior to the initiation of phase 1 clinical studies, you should ini tiate stability testing as early as possible to support use of the product for the duration of the proposed clinical investigation. Typically, the bulk release criteria will incl ude tests for visual appearance and plasmid concentration. We recommend that the fracti on of plasmid in supercoiled conformation be included in the bulk release criteria, and that you establish a minimum specification for supercoiled plasmid content (preferably >80%). You may select different release criteria and specifications if they provide data to establish that the selected criteria are predictive of immunogenicity or other intended biological activities. You should evaluate bulk plasmid preparations for the presence of bacterial host cell macromolecules including DNA, RNA, and protein and set preliminary limits for the maximum level of each of these macromolecules (preferably <1%). As product development progresses, the level of host ce ll material should be further reduced, as technically and logistically f easible. You should perform a test for pyrogenic substances and include the test result s with the final lot release documentation. The Limulus 3 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test is a sensitiv e indicator of the presence of bacterial endotoxins and endotoxin contamination. The amount of endotoxin in plasmid DNA vaccine preparations should not exceed 40 EU/mg plasmid. You should include a test to establish the id entity of the bulk product. For example, agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid DNA after restriction enzyme digestion is one test that can be used to identify and distin guish individual plasmids. When a single manufacturing facility is us ed to manufacture more than one DNA vaccine product, the identity test(s) should be capable of uni quely identifying each plasmid produced in the facility. You should develop a potency assay. During early clinical development, sponsors will have considerable flexibility in the selecti on of potency assays. This flexibility could include in vitro measures of transfection effi ciency that monitor the transcription and/or translation of the encoded gene(s) or in vivo assays of DNA v accine immunogenicity. We recommend that quantitative potency assays that evaluate relevant biological activity be developed as product development proceeds . Whenever possible, evidence that the selected potency assay correlates with the im munogenicity or prot ective activity observed in clinical trials should be provided. We recommend that you maintain retention samples of each lot to facilitate comparisons between lots as assay development progresses. You may choose to discuss the sele ction and implementation of a potency assay with CBER to ensure acceptability of the design. C. Final Product Release Testing You should test the final DNA vaccine produc t for potency, general safety, sterility, purity, quantity, and identity. The test methods and specifications may be the same as those employed for the bulk product release. If the plasmid product is lyophilized we recommend that you perform a test for residua l moisture. You should perform a test for the presence of endotoxin on each lot of final pr oduct. In addition to final product release testing, you should also perform in-process test ing to ensure manufacturing consistency and product safety. You should establish acceptance criteria and acceptable limits and report the results for each lot of vaccine to be used for clinical studies. IV. DNA VACCINE MODIFICATIONS A. Changes to the Insert or Vector If the DNA sequence of the insert gene and/ or backbone vector of a DNA vaccine are changed, we recommend that you consult w ith CBER to discuss whether the nature and/or magnitude of the change(s) warrant the conduct of additional preclinical studies and/or the submission of a new IND. You should provide to CBER a description of the 4 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations changes in manufacturing process and the resu lts from preclinical sa fety evaluations of the new (modified) DNA vaccine. B. DNA Sequence Analysis An issue of product identity of particular relevance to DNA vaccines concerns the degree to which plasmids should be sequenced before the initiation of phase 1 clinical studies. In 1996, we recommended that manufacturers provide (at a minimum) the sequence of the protein-encoding gene insert. Based on evidence that the plasmid backbone may influence vaccine activity, and recognizing that technological advances since 1996 have facilitated DNA sequencing, we recommend that manufacturers provide the complete sequence of the plasmid before initiating phase 1 clinical studies. As noted in Section III.A. of this document, the sequence should be fully annotated, and should identify any unexpected open reading frames and/or ot her sequence elements. Some DNA vaccines contain a complex mixture of plasmids, w ith each plasmid carrying a gene encoding a different antigenic protein. You should grow each plasmid separately. We advise that the identity and amount of each plasmid co mponent in the vaccine preparation be determined to ensure lot to lot consistency. V. PRECLINICAL IMMUNOGENICITY AND SAFETY A. General Considerations Preclinical safety evaluation is required for all new vaccines, including DNA vaccines, prior to their use in clinical studies (21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)). The Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations (21 CFR Part 58) apply to the co nduct of non-clinical laboratory safety studies that s upport or are intended to support applications such as INDs and biological license applica tions. We recommend that you perform preclinical safety studies on every novel DNA vaccine or DNA vaccine/adjuvant combination. We recommend that all preclinical toxicity and biodistribution/persiste nce studies evaluate the formulation and method of administration proposed for the clinical study. Additional safety evaluations may be necessary when changes are made, for example, to the formulation or route of ad ministration. We recommend that you consult with CBER prior to submission of your I ND to discuss the adequacy of your preclinical safety studies and prior human experience to support proceeding with the investigational vaccine product to Phase I clinical trials. B. Immunogenicity We recommend that vaccine immunogenicity be assessed in a relevant animal model whenever possible. This may include the evaluation of antigen-specific antibody titers, seroconversion rates, activation of cytokine secreting cells, and/or measures of cell- mediated immune responses. Unless they are also safety studies, pre-clinical immunogencity studies are not subject to the GLP regulatio ns, which do not apply to 5 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations basic exploratory studies carri ed out to determine whether a test article has potential utility (21 CFR 58.3(d)). For DNA vaccines that encode multiple antigens, you should assess the immune response generated against a representative subs et of the encoded antigens. C. Cytokines For DNA vaccines that contain immunomodulat ory genes (such as cytokine-encoding genes), we encourage preclinical studies in animal species responsive to the encoded human cytokine(s) or models using homologous animal gene (s). Such studies should assess whether modulation of cellular or hum oral components of the immune system might result in unintended adverse co nsequences, such as generalized immunosuppression, chronic inflammation, auto immunity or other immunopathology. We recommend that you consult with CBER con cerning the availability and suitability of animal models to conduct such testing. D. Prime/Boost Strategies When more than one type of vaccine is us ed in a sequential immunization protocol, we recommend that you submit information suppor ting the safety and tolerability of the dose, schedule, and route of administration of each component proposed for use in the heterologous prime-boost regimen. If existing data are deemed adequate to characterize the potential risks of the prime-boost regimen to study participants, additional toxicology studies may not be necessary. We recommend that sponsors consult with CBER for recommendations on the need for additional toxicology information to support the clinical plans. E. Autoimmunity Published preclinical studies indicate th at DNA vaccination can activate autoreactive B cells to secrete IgG anti-DNA autoantibodies. However, the magnitude and duration of this response appears to be insufficient to cause disease in normal animals or accelerate disease in autoimmune-prone mice. These preclinical studies s uggest that systemic autoimmunity is unlikely to result from DN A vaccination. Similarly, the absence of an immune response against cells expressing the vaccine-encoded antigen (including muscle cells and dendritic cells) suggest s that an autoimmune response directed against tissues in which such cells reside is unlikely. Yet th e possibility persists that DNA vaccines might idiosyncratically cause or worsen organ- specific autoimmunity by encoding antigens (including cryptic antigens) that cross-reac t with self. Thus, we no longer recommend that preclinical studies be performed to sp ecifically assess whether vaccination causes autoimmune disease, but recommend that the general welfare of an imals in preclinical immunogenicity and toxicity studies continue to be carefully monitored. In cases where an immune response is i nduced by a transgene product encoding self- antigen (such as a cytokine, chemokine, surf ace receptor/ligand, or cryptic self-antigen), 6 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations we recommend that you examine potential cross-reactivity with the corresponding endogenous protein. If a pers istent immune response agains t an endogenous protein is detected, we recommend that you evaluate potential adverse e ffects by studying the analogous animal gene in a relevant animal model. We further recommend that you monitor whether an immune response against the self-antigen is elicited during the clinical trial, and carefully evaluate the e ffect of this response on trial participants. F. Local Reactogenicity and Systemic Toxicity Studies Studies designed to assess systemic toxicity and local site reactogenicity may be combined. We recommend that these studies include at least one immunization beyond that planned for clinical use. We recomm end that you use the highest dose of vaccine planned for clinical use. An accelerated sche dule of vaccine delivery will be considered by FDA. We recommend that the assessments written into the preclinical study protocols include toxicity to potential target organs, including the hematopoietic and immune systems. We recommend that preclinical studies also include clinical pathology assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, an d coagulation tests) , and histopathology, encompassing both gross and microscopic assessment of tissues. For additional guidance, sponsors are referred to the \"WHO Guidelines on Non-clinical Evaluation of Vaccines\" for recommendations concerning the choice of animal model and study design for evaluating local reactogeni city and systemic toxicity (www.who.int/entity/biologicals/publica tions/en/). For studies of injection s ite reactogenicity, you should include detailed clinical observations of the injection site(s) fo llowing each vaccine administration and histological evaluations of in jection-site tissue obtained from biopsies or term necropsy samples. You should evaluate both short-term and persistent toxicity, preferably by studying separate cohorts of animals 2 to 3 days and 2 to 3 weeks after the final vaccination. G. Biodistribution, Persistence, and Integration Analysis Plasmid biodistribution, persiste nce and integration studies were initially recommended to examine whether subjects in DNA vaccine tria ls were at heightened risk from the long- term expression of the encoded antigen, either at the site of injec tion or an ectopic site, and/or plasmid integration. Theoretical c oncerns regarding DNA integration include the risk of tumorigenisis if insertion reduces th e activity of a tumor s uppressor or increases the activity of an oncogene. In addition, DNA integration may result in chromosomal instability through the in duction of chromosomal breaks or rearrangements. A typical biodistribution/persistence study assesses the pres ence of plasmid collected from a panel of tissues at multiple time points ranging from a few days to several months post administration. The panel of tissues typically includes the bl ood, heart, brain, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries/testes, lung, drai ning lymph nodes, spleen, muscle at the site of administration and subc utis at the injection site. Plasmid levels are typically 7 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations evaluated using a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (Q-PCR) validated for sensitivity, specificity and the absence of inhibitors. We recommend that the sensitivity of this assay be sufficien t to quantify <100 copies of plasmid per microgram of host DNA. A claim of \"non- persistence\" requires that the amount of plasmid at each site falls below this limit of quantification. Studies examining plasmid biodistribution/ persistence indicate that DNA vaccines prepared from a common plasmid vector but encoding different antigens behave similarly. Conventional intramuscular, subcut aneous, intradermal, and particle-mediated delivery of DNA plasmids rarely results in the long-term persiste nce of vector DNA at ectopic sites. However, tissue at or near th e site of administrati on frequently contains thousands of copies of plasmid per microgram of host DNA for periods exceeding 60 days. Studies assessing the nature of this DNA indicates that the vast majority is not integrated. Based on these findings, biodistribution st udies may be waived for DNA vaccines produced by inserting a novel gene into a plas mid vector previously documented to have an acceptable biodistribution/integration prof ile. Biodistribution studies will still be necessary for DNA vaccines utilizing novel vect ors, formulations, methods of delivery, routes of administration, or any other modifications expected to significantly impact cellular uptake and/or biodistribution. Be fore conducting biodistribution/persistence studies, we recommend that you contact FDA for advice concerning the need for these studies. Based on published studies analyzing the fr equency with which DNA plasmids persist and integrate, FDA believes that integrati on studies are warranted only when plasmid persists in any tissue of any animal at levels exceeding 30,000 copies per ug of host DNA by study termination. If the persistence of DNA plasmid exceeds this threshold, sponsors should evaluate whether the DNA ha s integrated into the genome of the vaccinated animals. A typical integrati on study will assess all tissue(s) containing persisting DNA plasmid. We recommend that at least four independent DNA samples be analyzed. Each sample may include DNA pool ed from several different donors. Q-PCR is generally used to detect and quantify the amount of plasmid DNA present in each genomic DNA preparation. Unintegrated plasmid DNA may be se parated from high molecular weight genomic DNA by gel purificat ion. Concatamer may be eliminated by restriction endonuclease digest ion targeting a rare motif present in the DNA plasmid. Specifically designed PCR primers may be us ed to confirm integration and identify genomic integration sites. 8 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations VI.
