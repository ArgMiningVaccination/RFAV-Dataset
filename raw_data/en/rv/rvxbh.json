Excludes gift vouchers When I was first asked to write this article, I had balked at the idea. After all, it is a subject that hit a little too close to home for me. I had been through what I like to call the \"BCS\" or \"Breast Cancer Scare\" when I was just 38. Although I was spared the \"Big C\" this time around, I did need to have a lumpectomy done on my right breast (I'm now missing a third of that breast). So, yes, I remember finding the lump, getting the mammogram, going in for surgery, etc. Looking back on that time now, I also remember, prior to that \"nightmare,\" that I had been under a lot of stress at the time, which may have played a part in the lump forming in the first place. And we all know by now that stress is often a precursor to illness. But this is not going to be an article about breast cancer per se. See the links at the end of this article for more information concerning crystals that deal with that specifically. This article is going to address the crystals that may help to keep our breasts healthy in the first place, so that you or someone you love may not have to deal with the \"BCS.\" We're going to look at crystals that can help with most every aspect of breast health; from pain and inflammation (that often occurs during the monthly cycles, during pre-and-post-menopause), breastfeeding and lactation, and healthy breasts in general. Now for some biology (stay with me, you'll thank me at the end!). Our breasts are composed of fatty tissue, glandular tissue that is divided into lobes, and connective tissue that ties it all together. The glandular tissue is comprised of lymph glands/nodes which are located along lymph vessels back to your armpit as well as up towards your collarbone. The lymphatic system is a major part of one's immune system. When we get sick, our lymph glands often become inflamed. In addition to the armpits, we have lymph glands in the neck (which is why doctors often palpate these when we become ill), chest, and groin. The lymphatic cells form antibodies that fight infection. The lymphatic system is responsible for removing toxins in the body. Organs associated with the lymphatic system include the tonsils, adenoids, thymus, and spleen. ( [see this diagram to the lymphatic system in the breast](http://www.mariekeating.ie/cancer-information/breast-cancer/the-breasts-and-lymphatic-system/)) In order to keep our breasts healthy, it stands to reason that the immune system and the lymphatic system in particular, need to be healthy. Metaphysically speaking, the breasts are located smack dab in the center of the Heart chakra, which is responsible for feelings of love, compassion, empathy and healing (especially with our hands, arms, as well as healing with herbs/nature). Parts of the body influenced by this chakra are the breasts, heart, lungs, arms, hands, upper back, skin, circulatory system, rib cage, and the lymph glands. When a blockage occurs in this chakra, we become more susceptible to illnesses in these parts of the body. Emotionally, a blockage can result in panic attacks, allergies, jealousy, possessiveness, and over-emotional outbursts. Crystals ruled by the [Heart chakra](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-heart-ailment.html?tab=2) are those that are usually green or pink, such as [Amazonite](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-amazonite-stone.html?sort_view=stone) and [Rose Quartz](https://www.healingcrystals.com/products-by-rose%20quartz-stone.html?sort_view=stone). These are crystals that you can work with to promote healthy breast but they may also help with breast information on crystals that may help with Breast Cancer and support during and after treatment, see the following articles: When you've chosen the crystal(s) you wish to work with, you can meditate while holding one or more in your hands; you can place them near your bedside with the intention that they keep you well and improve healing; you can carry or wear them as jewelry (some folks even keep one or two in their bra), or you could make a medicine bag to carry your crystals in a pocket or purse. Whatever you choose, make sure to cleanse your crystals before and often during use. If you enjoy making aromatherapy blends, we also have an easy DIY blend with Essential Oils that can promote healing as well as reduce stress and it includes Rose Quartz and Rhodonite to provide energies of love and detoxification. This [blend](https://www.healingcrystals.com/a_2kd.php) can work well to enhance your work with your chosen crystal/s or you can use it on its own. I sincerely hope that this article can help you find the answers you seek and that in some small way, I was able to alleviate some fear, confusion, or uncertainty for you and/or someone you love. I wish you blessings and good health. *Disclaimer - Crystals are not a medical treatment and should not be used as a replacement for medical care.
