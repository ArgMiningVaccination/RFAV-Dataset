Poria cocos (Polyporaceae) is a saprophytic fungus that grows in diverse species of Pinus . Its scleroti- um, called fu-ling orhoelen , is used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for its diuretic,sedative, and tonic effects. Various studies of thisfungus have demonstrated its marked anti-in-flammatory activity in different experimentalmodels of acute and chronic inflammation. It iswidely used as a constituent of many prepara-tions in Asian medicine, but the number of re-search papers on its clinical properties is insuffi-cient for establishing its efficacy and safety froma scientific point of view. In this review, we havecompiled all the published data concerning thechemistry, pharmacology, and clinical uses of thisdrug in order to evaluate its clinical interest forfuture use against various pathologies in whichinflammation and immunodepression are impli-cated. We selected the papers for review on the ba-sis of their ethnopharmacological relevance, usingthe most relevant databases for the biomedical sci-ences. Studies on various fungus extracts as well ason the major phytochemical compounds (polysac-charides and triterpenoids) present in Poria cocos comprised the principal objectives of this review.In several of the studies reviewed, the inhibitoryeffects of triterpenes on phospholipase A 2(PLA 2) have been clearly demonstrated. In addition, theinhibitory effects of Poria cocos on the secretion of different cytokines from human peripheral bloodmonocytes have also been described. Triterpe-noids are known to have a pivotal influence on cer-tain diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoria-sis, autoimmune uveitis, septic shock, and possiblybronchial asthma, while polysaccharides can po-tentiate the immune response. Reviewing the lit-erature, we found that polysaccharides from Poria cocos enhanced the secretion of immune stimula- and suppressed the secretion of immune sup-pressors, thus potentiating the immune response.In addition, they showed antitumor activity against different cancer cell lines.

The genus made up of species that possess simple septate hyphae, cause brown rots, and produce annualpolyporoid hyaline spores [1]. These sharedmorphological and have long beenconsidered important in traditional polypore taxonomy; howev-er, recent molecular work indicates that this withinthe \"core polyporoid \"class of true polypores [2]. The species of this genus show microscopic similarities to other related speciesfrom closely related genera, such as Laetiporus, Phaeolus ,a n d Pyc- noporellus , despite producing macroscopic fruiting bodies that are thin, resupinate, and lacking in bright pigmentations [1].Poria cocos is dimitic and has greatly inflated skeletal hyphae, a defining characteristic of this genus [3]. This species gives large,edible sclerotia that have been referred to as \"tuckahoes \"or\"In- dian bread \"in North America, where the name Wolfiporia cocos is used. However, the name Poria cocos is preferred in Asia [1], where the sclerotium -called fu-ling in Chinese and hoelen in Japanese -is collected and used in traditional Chinese and Japa- nese medicine as a diuretic, sedative, and tonic [4].Poria cocos is a saprophytic fungus that grows in diverse Pinus species such as P. densiflora and P. mansoniana . In the wild it grows much like the European truffle, but other genera, such asCitrus, Eucalyptu s, or can be parasited [5]. Different parts of fu-ling are used in herbal medicine: the bark or fu-ling- pi, the outermost layer next to the bark or chih-fu-ling, which is reddish in color, the middle layer or bai-fu-ling (or simply fu- ling), which is white in color, and the core or fu-shen , which in- cludes the wood to which it is attached. Each crude drug obtainedfrom Poria cocos has different properties [6]. Chemical Composition ! Poria cocos contains two principal groups of chemicals, the triter- pene fraction and the polysaccharide fraction. Other minor com-pounds have also been described, including steroids, amino acids,choline, histidine, and potassium salts [5 isolated from cocos , almost all of them derived from lanostane or secolanostane skeletons. Duringthe past decade, Tai et al. [8 -13] and other Chinese and Japanese research groups have isolated all the major known compoundsfrom Poria cocos , Akihisa et al. [14,15] isolated 35 compounds, 20 previ-ously known and 15 new structures from this species, whileZheng and Yang [16,17] isolated 10 triterpenes, two of which - poriacosone A and poriacosone B -were new. The isolated triterpenes from Poria be de- rivatives from a lanostane skeleton; however, some differenceshave been observed. For example, many possess different struc-tures derived from an eburicane skeleton (a C 21lanostane with a methyl in C 24) and they usually present one (at C 8-C9) or two (at C7-C8and C 9-C11) unsaturated positions. Moreover, various com- pounds are derived from a 3,4- seco-lanostane and 3,4- seco-ebur-icane skeleton. These general structures are given in l\"Fig. 1 , with the most relevant active triterpenoids being shown inl \"Fig. 2 and Table 1 .Table Triterpenes cocos. acid Poricoic acid Poricoic 6,7-Dehydroporicoic [15] 25-Hydroxyporicoic [15]25-Hydroxyporicoic acid ...Planta Med 2011; 77: 681 -691Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Polysaccharides Many different polysaccharides have been isolated from Poria co- cos; however, because the nomenclature is not sufficiently clear, there are probably several names for the same compound. Before1980, various authors had already isolated a compound called - pachyman which was defined as (1 3)-(16)-- D-glucan [24]. Other subsequently carboximethyl pachymaran, U-pachymaranf, and polysaccharide H 11, which exhibited different properties when they were tested and thus probably have different chemicalconfigurations [25]. More recently, other authors have isolateddifferent polysaccharides from Poria cocos ; because these were more clearly defined, their chemical structure could be estab-lished unequivocally. For example, six polysaccharide fractionswere isolated sequentially from the mycelia of a wild strain ofPoria cocos cultured in two media differing in one constituent, ei- ther bran extract or corn steep liquor, labeled wb and wc, respec-tively. From these, various extracts were obtained with 0.9% NaCl(PCM1), hot water (PCM2), 0.5 NaOH (PCM3 I and II), and 88% for-mic (PCM4 and II). The heteropolysaccharides wb- and wc-PCM1 and PCM2 were mainly composed of man- whereas wb-PCM3-I PCM4-I, and PCM4-II were all (1 3)--D-glucans. In addition, two exo-polysaccharides isolated from the two culture mediavia methanol precipitation (wb- and wc-PCM0) also differed intheir monosaccharide composition [26].Recently, Wang polysaccharide while PCS3-II is a linear (1 3)--D-glucan of high purity that constitutes the main component of the sclero-tium of Poria cocos . PCS4-I is a linked 3)-- D-glu- can with few -(16), and PCS4-II is a linked branched (1 3)- -D-glucan with few -(12) and -(16). However, in a pilot scale facility-fermentation tank, a water-insoluble configuration was isolated from was coded Other isolated compounds Ukiya et al. [23] described the isolation of dehydroabietic acid methyl ester, Akihisa et al. [15] that of 7-oxo-dyhydroxydehy-droabietic acid, and Li et al. [29] the isolation of (S)-(+)-turmer-one and ergosterol peroxide, along with other known triterpe-noids. Other nonrelevant compounds have also acids [5]. Pharmacological Properties ! Anti-inflammatory activity A hydroalcoholic extract from Poria cocos was found to inhibit the acute ear edema induced by 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- acetate (TPA) and arachidonic acid, the paw edema induced by Fig. 1 General structures of triterpenoids from Poria cocos.683 R\u00edos 2011; 77: 681 -691Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. carrageenan, the dermatitis induced by TPA, and the delayed- type hypersensitivity induced by oxazolone. Bioguided isolationof the active compounds led to the identification of two triterpe-noids: pachymic acid ( 1) and dehydrotumulosic acid ( 2). These isolated compounds inhibited acute ear edema with ID 50values of 4.7 and 0.68 nmol/ear, respectively, which indicates a consid-erable anti-inflammatory potency [30].Both compounds also inhibited the acute paw induced byphospholipase A 2(PLA 2) and serotonin while ear edema induced ethyl phenylpropiolate. compoundhad acid-induced edema.When compounds 1and 2were studied as possible corticoid-like agents, results showed a clear difference between them. Whereasthe anti-edema activity of 2was not affected by progesterone (a corticoid receptor antagonist), actinomycin D (an RNA transcrip-tion blocker), or cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor),the activity of 1was affected by progesterone and, to a lesser de- gree, by actinomycin D. These findings suggest that while thecompounds do not act through a corticoid-like mechanism, inthe case of 1, the corticoid receptor may be implicated [31]. The same authors reported the possible mechanism of action of themajor triterpenoids isolated from the active extract. Compounds1and 2both showed significant inhibitory activity against PLA 2 from Naja naja venom, with the latter exhibiting greater activity [32]. Extracellular PLA 2plays a pathogenic role both by causing direct damage to the cellular membrane through phospholipidhydrolysis and through the liberation of arachidonic acid, whichis the precursor of many of the eicosanoids responsible for in-flammatory responses. As such, PLA 2may play a pivotal role in various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, thusmaking these triterpenoids potentially interesting as therapeuticagents. In similar work, Jain et al. [33] demonstrated that acidic Fig. 2 Active lanostanoids isolated from Poria cocos ...Planta Med 2011; 77: 681 -691Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. triterpenoids are inhibitors of PLA 2. They studied the effects of two derivatives, masticadienoic and masticadienolic acids, withregard to their interaction with three different forms of PLA 2 and demonstrated that both a bulk tetracyclic structure and aside alkyl carboxylic chain are necessary for rendering PLA 2inac- tive, although the latter part of the molecule seems to be the onethat occupies and blocks the catalytic site of the enzyme. This hy-pothesis was supported by theoretical spatial considerations aswell as by the fact that their homologous methyl esters are inac-tive. In the case of pachymic and dehydrotumulosic acids, the po-sition of the free carboxylic group can vary (C 21instead of C 26) and the hybridization state of carbons C 7C10can also admit some variation with no loss of activity. Cu\u00e9llar et al. [32] thus hy-pothesized that the alicyclic structure probably does not exertany spatially-specific function, but merely provides the lipophi-licity needed to go along the hydrophobic channel leading to theactive site of PLA 2, as postulated by Scott et al. [34]. In parallel, a second research group studied the effects of variousisolated triterpenes on TPA-induced ear edema, obtaining similarresults. For example, all the tested compounds inhibited the earedemas induced by TPA and arachidonic acid, with similar po-tency values. They also tested a larger group of compounds, in-cluding seco-derivatives. Of these, poricoic acid B ( 3), showed the highest potency in the TPA test while dehydrotrametenolicacid ( 4) gave the best results in the arachidonic acid test [18,35]. In a previous study, Nukaya et al. [19] obtained similar results forthe same or related compounds isolated from Poria cocos . Prieto et previously been isolated from Poria cocos , with this effect being due to the inhibition of PLA 2rather than to a 5-lipoxygenase effect, as was reported by Cu\u00e9llar et al. [32].Fuchs et al. [37] studied the effects of three concentrations of Po- ria cocos in a base cream which was tested on experimentally in- duced irritant contact dermatitis in a repeated sodium lauryl sul-phate irritation model. Anti-inflammatory activity was reportedforPoria cocos in all three experimental methods when the ex- tracts were applied parallel to the induction period of irritantcontact dermatitis. This effect can be explained by the influenceof containing product on proinflammatory enzymes, such asPLA 2, as previously reported by Cu\u00e9llar et al. [32]. These authors had demonstrated the effects of an ethanol extract of Poria cocos on an experimental model of contact dermatitis induced by oxa-zolone. Since both 1and 2were isolated from this extract, the ac- tivity was associated with them [30]. Immunomodulatory properties Certain medicinal plants and fungi, among them Poria cocos , are what are commonly referred to as immunomodulators, in thatthey alter the activity of immune function through the dynamicregulation of informational molecules such as cytokines [38].This property explains the effects of these plants on the immunesystem and other tissues. The most relevant research in this fieldis perhaps that of Yu and Tseng [39], who demonstrated, for ex-ample, that a 50% hot ethanol extract from Poria cocos increased the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 in human peripheral blood monocytes in vitro in a dose-dependent manner 6 h after treatment. At a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL, the extract causedan increase in other cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor(TNF)- . However, at 0.2 mg/mL it was found to suppress the se- cretion of transforming growth factor (TGF)- 3 h after in vitro treatment. Four years before, Tseng and Chang [40] had demon-strated that a culture medium containing 10% of a Poria cocos ex-tract , and granulocyte-monocyte secretion from the monocyte monolayer; in contrast, a reductionin the Poria cocos content of the extract produced an in secretion.The increased secretion macrophages potentiates the immune response. The inflamma-tory response is also associated with high levels of these three cy-tokines in serum secreted by activated neutrophils, activated stimulate the mononuclear phagocytes, are involved in fe-ver and the acute phase of inflammation. TGF- , on the other hand, suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting mac-rophage activation and the secretion of other cytokines [39]. Be-cause extract obtained from of an immune suppressor (TGF- ), it should serve to potentiate the immune response [39].From the dried sclerotium of Poria cocos , Chang et al. [41] isolated and purified a new immunomodulatory protein (PCP), which hasa total of 35.6 kDa of a disulfide-linked heterodimer-ic glycoprotein with two subunits with 14.3 and 21.3 kDa, respec-tively, and which exhibits N-a n d O-glycosylation. In vitro ,t h i s glycoprotein stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages through the in-duction of TNF- and IL-1 as well as through the regulation of NF-B-related gene expression. In primary mouse macrophages, PCP directly activated peritoneal cavity macrophages to induceToll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated myeloid differentiation fac-tor 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling. Moreover, the glycosylatedportion of PCP was a key factor in PCP signaling TLR4 inperitoneal macrophages. This glycoprotein, along with Poria cocos itself, could thus be considered a new, potential immuno- stimulant.From the dried sclerotia powder of Poria al. [42] obtained a -(13)- D-glucan coded as PCS3-II, from which they then obtained the corresponding carboxymethylated derivative(CPC3-II) and the carboxymethylated-sulfated derivative (CSPCS3-II). The immunopotentiation activity of all three com- pounds was evaluated and the activity-structure relationshipwas determined. CS PCS3-II was found to enhance the immune ability of the spleen and to increase the carbon clearance indexof macrophages, the spleen and thymus weight index, hemolyticactivity, spleen antibody production, and the delayed type hyper-sensitivity response in mice. The authors hypothesized that thecoexistence of carboxymethyl and sulfate groups in CS PCS3-II molecules plays an important role in enhancing the immuno-modulatory activity of this particular polysaccharide. Anticancer properties Kaminaga et al. [43] studied of lanostane-type triterpene acids from Poria cocos on tumor promotion by TPA in two-stage carcinogenesis in mouse skin, demonstratingthat 1, 3,a n O-acetyl-16 -hydroxytrametenolic acid ( 5) all in- hibited the promoting effects of TPA on skin tumors after initia-tion with 7,12-dimethylbenz[ a]anthracene (DMBA). In 2002, Ukiya et effects of 10 triterpenes iso-lated from cocos on the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV EA) activation induced by the tumor promoter TPA in Raji cells. The compounds all displayed activity, but subsequent eval-uation of the cytotoxicity of the compounds poricoic acid G ( 6) and poricoic acid A ( 7) against human cancer cell lines revealed that the former was significantly cytotoxic to leukemia HL-60685 R\u00edos J-L.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. cells at nM range (although it showed only moderate cytotoxicity against the other cell lines) while the latter compound exhibitedonly moderate cytotoxicity against all the cancer cell lines tested.Several years later, Akihisa et al. [14] used the same protocol tostudy a series of triterpenoids in vitro to evaluate their antitu- mor-promoting activity. All the tested compounds exhibited lowcytotoxicity against Raji cells, with 13 showing high inhibitory IC 50values of 195 -340 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA. In the same study, the authors evaluated the inhibitory properties in vivo of two compounds, 16-deoxyporicoic acid B ( 8) and poricoic acid C ( 9), in a two-stage carcinogenesis test on mouse skin using DMBA as an initiator and TPA as a promoter. Eleven weeks aftertreatment, the percentage of papilloma-bearing mice in thetreated groups was only 20% for 8and 27% for 9, whereas after 20 weeks the percentages were 80% and 87%, respectively. Whenthe authors evaluated the average number of papillomas permouse at 11 weeks it was 1.2 and 1.5, respectively, whereas at20 weeks it was 3.2 and 3.6, respectively. These findings, howev-er, should be compared to those of the untreated group, whichshowed a 100% incidence of papillomas 11 weeks after promo-tion. From the results of both the in vitro EBV EA induction assay and the in vivo from the sclerotiumofPoria cocos , 3,4- seco-3-oic acid functionality ( l\"Fig. 1 ), may serve as valuable chemopreventive agents against chemical carcinogene-sis. Two years later, the same authors completed this study with11 compounds isolated from Poria cocos : 10 triterpenoids and 1 diterpene. All effects in vitro against TPA-in- duced EBV EA Raji 25- methoxyporicoic acid A ( 10) exhibited inhibitory activity in the two-stage carcinogenesis test. The authors concluded that whilelanostane triterpenoids may be potentially chemopreventive,they are not effective antitumor agents [15].Mizushina et al. [44] studied the effects of 9 triterpene acids (4eburicane-type, 1 polymerases and DNA topoisomerases from mam-mals. Among the tested compounds, only dehydroeburiconic acid(11) (described as dehydroebriconic acid in this paper) was de- tected as a possible inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II activity,with a moderate inhibitory effect on the activity of other DNApolymerases. Dehydrotrametenonic acid ( 12) also showed a moderate inhibitory effect against topoisomerase II and a weakeffect against all the polymerases tested. These findings suggestthat 11and 12should be designated as topoisomerase II-prefer- ential moderate inhibitory effects against all themammalian DNA polymerases tested. Both compounds also pre-vented the growth of human gastric cancers, halting them in theG 1phase of the cell cycle. While both compounds have the same pattern of substitution (C 3-keto, one carboxyl at C 21, and no hy- droxyl group), 12has a lanostane skeleton whereas 11has The hydrophobic triterpene backbone and the hy-drophilic carboxyl end of these compounds were able to bind tothe hydrophobic sheet and the hydrophilic amino acids in DNApolymerase , respectively. Both triterpenes showed an interest- ing spectrum of enzyme inhibition, and were able to recognizesmall structural differences among the binding sites on topo-isomerases. These triterpenes may thus be useful tools for study-ing the microstructure of such binding sites and could be helpfulin designing new drugs with the aid of computer simulation [44].From a bioactivity-guided fractionation of the methylene Li et al. [29] iso- lated 6 compounds, three of which exhibited moderate cytotoxic-ity against a human colon carcinoma cell line; however, four ofthe compounds -1, polyporenic acid C acid ( 15)-exhibited inhibitory activity against DNA topoisomerase II, as well as against DNA topoisom-erase I. The activity of some of these compounds was related tothe induction of apoptosis. For example, 11and 12inhibited calf DNA polymerase and rat DNA polymerase [20] while 4selec- tively inhibited the growth of H ras transformed cells and in- duced apoptosis [45]. It also regulated the expression of H ras as well as that of Akt (a serine/threonine specific protein kinasefamily) and Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), whichare the downstream proteins of H ras signaling pathways. Anoth- er isolated compound from Poria cocos ,1, reduced cell prolifera- tion and dose- Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3,all of which, taken together, indicate that 1initiates apoptosis by causing mitochondria dysfunction. Compound 1also decreased the expression and activation of proteins within the Akt signalingpathway. These results, along with the compound s previously re- ported inhibition of PLA 2activity, led these authors to hypothe- size a relationship between 1-influenced apoptosis and reduction of both prostaglandin synthesis and Akt activity, as PLA 2is ele- vated in prostatic adenocarcinoma and conversion leads to Akt pro-survival activity [46].Ling et al. [47] studied the effect of 13on the growth of A549 non- small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) and demonstrated that it sig-nificantly reduces cell proliferation via the induction of apopto-sis, as evidenced by sub-G 1analysis, 3 and poly(ADP- ribose)-polymerase (PARP). However, treatment of cells with 13 was not accompanied by either disruption of mitochondrialmembrane potential or an increase in the cleavage of procas-pase-9. Further, 13-induced apoptosis was inhibited by caspase- 8 inhibitors, but not by a caspase-9 inhibitor. It also suppressedthe PI3-kinase/Akt signal pathway and enhanced p53 activation.In conclusion, the results suggest that 13induces apoptosis through the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, inwhich the of caspase-8 leads to the direct cleavage ofexecution caspases without the involvement of mitochondria.In 2004, Wu et al. [48] isolated 9 triterpenes from Poria cocos and assayed their cytotoxic and antioxidant properties. None of thecompounds showed any promising antioxidant activity, in agree-ment with data previously reported by Schinella et al. [49], but allof them except 15showed cytotoxicity at different doses against human lung cancer cell line A549 and human prostate cancer cellline DU145 [50].Several authors have studied the antitumor activity isolated from Poria cocos . For example, Kanaya- ma et al. [25] reported the effects of polysaccharide H 11-a (13)-(16)--D-glucan in a ratio of 4:1 each and with a mo- lecular weight of 5 \u00d7 106-against subcutaneous sarcoma 180 at doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg \u00d7 10, but found that it had no effect on as-cites sarcoma 180. The compound had an inhibition ratio of 96%with respect to the control group. The anticancer activity of Poria cocos, along with its other effects, has been associated with its ca- pacity to inhibit angiogenesis by downregulating NF- B [51]. This effect has been studied with the polysaccharide fraction, and es-686 R\u00edos J-L.

In a later study, Lee et al. [53] demonstrated thatPCSC induces NF- B/Rel activation and iNOS expression through the TLR4, and CR3 membrane receptor and through p38 ki-nase, which is critical in the signal transduction leading to NF- B/ Rel activation in murine macrophages.Jin water-soluble heteropolysaccharidefractions obtained from Poria cocos mycelia cultured from one wild and one cultivated strain. Both the in vitro and in vivo anti- tumor activities of the heteropolysaccharides were evaluated andcompared. The authors found that the heteropolysaccharidesfrom the wild strain cultured in a medium containing corn steepliquor exhibited the highest antitumor activities against sarcoma180 in vivo while the heteropolysaccharides from mycelium cul- tured in media with bran extract did not significantly inhibit tu-mor growth. Indeed, polysaccharides isolated from the differentstrains of Poria cocos mycelia (a series of compounds named PCM) generally seemed to have different in vivo andin vitro anti- tumor activities, depending on their monosaccharide composi-tion, protein content, molecular mass, and chain conformation.Zhang et al. [55] studied the reported immune-enhancing andantitumor activities of PCM3-II, a purified water-soluble -glucan comprising mainly (1 3) and (1 4) linkages obtained from the mycelia of Poria cocos . PCM3-II reduced the proliferation and via- bility of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells in vitro in a dose- dependent manner, decreasing the cancer-cell growth by 50% at400 \u00b5g/mL. The authors also studied the time effect of PCM3-IIand found that the -glucan arrested the cell cycle in the G 1 phase, an effect associated with downregulation of the expres- sion of cyclins D 1and E. the deple- tion of anti-apoptotic to five water-soluble derivatives, respectively, to be tested against sarcoma180 tumor cells and a gastric carcinoma cell strain (MKN-45 andSGC-7901), both in vitro andin vivo . Whereas the -glucan showed no antitumor sulfated and carboxymeth-ylated derivatives exhibited significant antitumor activitiesagainst S-180 and gastric carcinoma tumor cells. The authors,Wang et al., hypothesized that these properties are based ongood water solubility, relatively high chain stiffness, and themoderate molecular mass of the derivatives in aqueous solution[56]. This explanation is supported by the results of an experi-ment conducted by Zhang et al. [57] with the water-soluble ac-PCM0 in vivo antitumor activity and showed a significantly higher enhancement ratio of body weight than 5-fluorouracil,with no cytotoxic effects.Two kinds of water-insoluble (1 3)-- different Poria cocos myce- lia were sulfated to obtain two series water-soluble derivatives,ab-PCM3-I-S1-S5 and ac-PCM3-I-S1-S5, respectively. These weretested against sarcoma 180 tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo and displayed a significantly higher activity than those from thenative - D-glucans. Different structural features and the higher water solubility of the transformed products may explain the en-hanced studied for its effects on anti-proliferation and differentiation of different human leukemiccells in vitro , with the results showing that it suppressed the cell proliferation of U937 and HL-60 cells. It also induced both U937cells and HL-60 cells to differentiate into mature monocytes/mac-rophages, which in turn markedly expressed the surface antigensof CD11b, CD14, and CD68. The differentiated U937 physiological functions such as respiratory burstand phagocytosis. Moreover, the levels of interferon (IFN)- and TNF- were higher than those observed in the control group. Antibody neutralization tests demonstrated that the growth-in-hibitory and differentiation-inducing activities were mainly dueto the elevated levels of IFN- and TNF- , suggesting that PCPS is a biological response modifier rather than a cytotoxic reagent andcould constitute a potential alternative in leukemia therapy [59].As commented above, Chen et al. [42] obtained a -(13)- D-glu- can PCS3-II). The authors studied the anticancer properties of these compounds in vivo on male BALB/c mice ino- culated with sarcoma 180 (S-180) tumor cells. Microscopic ex-amination of the tumor cells revealed signs of necrosis and apo-ptosis in cells treated with the carboxymethylated-sulfated de-rivative and enhancement of immune response in the spleen.The authors suggest that CS PCS3-II exerts this antitumor activity through immunomodulation. Antihyperglycemic effects Various studies have been published on the use of Poria cocos , ei- ther alone or in combination with other crude drugs, to treat dia-betes. Li et al. [60] studied the antihyperglycemic effects of amethanol crude extract of Poria cocos on streptozocin-treated db/db mice. The extract reduced blood glucose via increased in-sulin sensitivity. Three fractions -chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water extracts -were obtained from the crude extract, but only the first exhibited any activity. The authors then isolated threeterpenoids ( 1, 2,a n d 4), which they studied using the same pro- tocol while also examining the effect of modifying/activating theperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)- pathway on the increase of insulin sensitivity. The authors found that neitherthe active extract nor the isolated triterpenes activated the PPAR-pathway and hypothesized that the compounds may instead af- fect 5 -AMP activated protein kinase. Further studies have thus been proposed. However, in a previous study, Sato et al. [61] haddemonstrated that 4promotes adipocyte differentiation in vitro and acts as an insulin sensitizer in vivo . Indeed, the compound was found to reduce hyperglycemia in mouse models of noninsu-lin-dependent diabetes mellitus, acting as an insulin sensitizer,as demonstrated in the glucose tolerance test. It was also shownto induce adipose conversion, activate PPAR- in vitro , and reduce hyperglycemia in animal models of noninsulin-dependent diabe-tes mellitus. In addition, Su and Huang [62] demonstrated a pos-itive effect of Poria cocos on the PPAR- pathway, with its ethyl acetate extract reversing the previous suppression of TNF- on the PPAR- of human (LX-2) and rat (HSC T6) cells while enhanc- ing the PPAR- activities of hepatic stellate cells. The extract also inhibited NF- B activity induced by TNF- and attenuated the TNF- -induced protein and mRNA expression of -smooth muscle actin.Recently, Huang et al. [63] demonstrated that 2, 13, 14, 15, 16 , and especially 1increase glucose uptake, GLU4 gene ...Planta Med 2011; 77: 681 -691Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Other pharmacological effects The antinephritic was investi-gated by Hattori et The authors demonstrated its original-type anti-GBM nephritis in rats and concludedthat the of pachyman may partly bedue to the inhibitory action of this agent on C3 deposition in theglomeruli.Dhan et al. [65] reported the effect of carboxymethyl pachy-maram from Poria cocos cells.A from of a Trypanosoma cruzi Bra C15C2 clone in vitro .I t showed significant effects against the parasite, inhibiting growthby 30% [66].Li et al. [67] were the first to demonstrate the nematicidal activityofPoria cocos , which was able to . From the active extract, three new compounds were isolated and identified as 2,4,6-triacetylenic octane diacid,2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyhexanoic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-keto- n- butyl-2,4,5,6-tetrahydroxyhexanate. The first compound exhib-ited the highest activity.In an in vivo study, Zhang et al. [68] demonstrated the anti-rejec- tion effect of the ethanol extract of Poria cocos at two different doses in rats after cardiac allograft implantation. The survivaltime of donor hearts in the two experimental groups was signifi-cantly prolonged by approximately 130% and 330% (in days) withrespect to the control group. There was a clear reduction of patho-logical lesions in the two extract-treated groups, with the percen-tages of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes and the CD4+/CD8+ratio all being significantly lower.In vitro studies demonstrated that a methanol extract from Poria cocos protected red blood cells from the hemolysis induced by the hydrophilic radical generator 2,2 -azobis(2-amidinopropane) di- hydrochloride (AAPH); from this extract, [69] iso-lated five triterpene carboxylic 3- 16)-which were inhibit blood cells.The effect of Poria cocos on cytosolic free calcium concentration in the brain nerve cells of neonatal rats was investigated by Chenet al. [70]. Working with a water extract, the authors demonstrat-ed that the plant increased cytosolic free calcium in a dose-de-pendent manner, except at high doses. Moreover, the extract in-hibited the increase of cytosolic free calcium induced by highdoses of glutamate. Similar results were observed in experimentswith primarily cultured hippocampal neurons of neonatal rats.The authors concluded that the water extract of Poria cocos ex- erts bidirectional regulation of cytosolic cells.The of on the ototoxicity of kana- mycin in guinea-pigs studied by Liu et al. [71], who infusedthe decoction into the guinea-pigs and compared the differencesin the general intoxicating symptom, the prayer s reflex thresh- old, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and the absence rateof outer hair cells in the first turn of the cochlea. The authors con-cluded that Poria cocos may serve as a good antagonistic agent in kanamycin treatment.Tai et al. [13] studied the anti-emetic of an ethanolicextract from Poria cocos and 17 triterpenoids (11 natural prod- ucts isolated from the fungus and 6 semisynthetic derivatives).Using copper sulfate as an emetic agent in frogs, the authorsdemonstrated that the ethanolic extract, along with 1, its methyl ester, 7, and its dimethyl derivative all had anti-emetic proper- ties; however, the last compound exhibited the highest activityat the lowest dose. In addition, 13showed a high degree of toxic- ity. The authors concluded that triterpenes with an exo-methy-lene group at C 24in their side-chain (eburicanes) have anti-emet- ic properties.Lee et al. [72] recently studied the effects of 1, dehydroeburicoic acid ( 17) (the names of these compounds are changed here with respect to the formula), and 4(called 3 -hydroxylanosta-7,9 (11),24-trien-21-oic acid in this paper) on human 5-hydroxy-tryptamine 3A (5-HT 3A) receptor channel activity. The inhibited the 5HT-induced inward current ( I5-HT)i na concentration dependent and reversible manner, with IC 50val- ues of 3.2, 5.5, and 1.4 \u00b5M, respectively. While the inhibition ofI 5-HTby the triterpenoids occurred in a noncompetitive manner, the inhibition by 1and 4showed greater voltage-dependency. These results indicate the ex-pressed 3Areceptors in Xenopus oocytes and that this regula- partly responsible for the pharmacological effects ofPoria cocos . These results suggest that these compounds could be used in therapeutics for the suppression of clinical symptoms re-lated with activity of 5-HT 3Areceptor, such as vomiting and cocos a carboxy- methylated derivative. They demonstrated that carboxymethyla-tion enhances the bile acid binding capacity of the polysaccha-rides in vitro , probably due to the improved water solubility and structural changes caused by carboxymethylation. In addition,the semisynthetic derivative exhibited an increased antioxidantactivity with respect to the original compound. The authors hy-pothesized that the carboxymethylated derivative could provideseveral health benefits, including reduction of cholesterol andblood pressure.The antioxidant effects of a water soluble extract from Poria cocos (PCW) and its effect on -amyloid-induced neurotoxicity on rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells was studied by Park et al. [74],who suggested that PCW may protect cells by suppressing boththe oxidative stress and the apoptosis induced by -amyloid (1 - 42). Indeed, the pretreatment of PC12 cells with PCW within theconcentration range of 5 -125 \u00b5g/mL reduced -amyloid (1 -42)- induced cell death. In cells treated with PCW attenuated-amyloid (1 -42)-induced cytotoxicity, apoptotic features, and accumulation damage while decreasingthe expression of the apoptotic protein Bax and the activity ofcaspase-3. It also enhanced the expression of anti-apoptotic pro-tein Bcl-2. Taken together, these findings suggest that PCW maybe a potential natural agent against Alzheimer s disease. Pharmacokinetic Studies and Therapeutic Use ! Poria cocos is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used for its diuretic, sedative, and tonic effects [32]; indeed, it has beendemonstrated have spleen-invigorative, Med 2011; 77: 681 -691Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. sedative, tranquilizing, diuretic, and damp-clearing effects. It is mainly used to treat retention of phlegm and fluid, dysuria, ede-ma, poor appetite with watery stool, palpitations, and insomnia[7]. There are different specifications in the traditional use de-pending on the crude drug used; for example, fu-ling-pi promotes diuresis and reduces swelling whereas chih-fu-ling cleanses heat and eliminates dampness [6].Poria cocos has no adverse reactions described in the literature; however, it is not recommended in the case of polyuria.Using the human colonic adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell mono-layer as an intestinal epithelial cell model, Zheng and Yang [75]studied the permeability of 13, 16 ,a n d6 -hydroxypolyporenic acid C ( 18) from the apical to the basolateral side and vice-versa. The transport parameters and apparent permeability coefficientvalues of 13and 16were nearly of the same magnitude as those of the standard drug propranolol while those for 18lay between those of propranolol and atenolol (the reference drugs used inthe experiments). Moreover, the efflux transport of 13and 16 were higher than their influx transport. The authors concludedthat while all three compounds can be absorbed across intestinalepithelial cells, 13and 16could be completely absorbed whereas 18could only be moderately absorbed. In a similar study, the same authors [76] demonstrated that 1 could be transported through the Caco-2 cell monolayer in a con-centration-dependent manner and that the transport was linearwith time. The absorption in the apical to basolateral directionand the secretion in the opposite direction were both poor, withthe transport parameters and apparent permeability coefficientvalues being comparable to those of the reference drug atenolol.Although the diffusion of 1was passive, ATP was partially in- volved in its transport. Commercial Products and Form of Administration ! Poria cocos is present in the market under the names fu-ling, hoe- len, poria, tuckahoe, and Indian bread. It is normally white in col- or ( \"white poria \"), but there is a light red variant called \"red po- ria\". In China, Poria cocos is one of the major ingredients of Bu- Chy, a drug which has long been used to aid in the recovery from chronic diseases. The sclerotium is presented in different com-mercial forms such as dry power and capsules. It is available inWestern markets as a phytomedicine or as a natural dietary sup-plement, and is either presented alone or in combination withother medicinal plants or fungi. Dry powder of Poria cocos sclero- tium is used in infusions at daily doses of 6 -18 g. For reinforcing the spleen and the stomach, the recommended daily dose is 9 to18 g whereas for edema the dose may range as high as 30 to 45 g.As a sedative or for the treatment of palpitations and insomnia,the recommended dose is from 3 to 9 g [6,7]. Conclusions ! Several pharmacological effects of Poria cocos have been clearly demonstrated in experimental studies. Of these, it is importantto distinguish between anti-inflammatory and immunostimu-lant effects. Although the crude drug has been studied with re-gard to both properties, experimental studies show that purifiedextracts achieve the best effect. Thus, while anti-inflammatoryactivity has been clearly demonstrated for the triterpene-en-riched fraction, immunomodulation is correlated with the polysaccharide-enriched fractions. In the case of anticancerproperties, both groups of compounds are implicated, triterpenesas cytotoxic principles and polysaccharides as immunostimu-lants. With respect to clinical data, no relevant reports on the ex-tract or its isolated compounds are generally cited, only studiescarried out within traditional Chinese medicine; however, theseusually employ drug mixtures, such as STA-1 (a mixture of 10crude drugs) for treating allergic asthma [77] or Yi-jin (a mixturewith 3 other crude drugs) for treating diabetes mellitus type II[78]. With regard to the potential cytotoxicity of Poria cocos ,n o reports have appeared in the literature. This fungus is usually ad-ministered in China at high doses (up to 45 g), with no specifica-tion of adverse effects, although the Chinese Pharmacopoeia listsseveral contraindications, such as in Laetiporus and other G. the On anti-inflammatory and anti-phospholipase HC.
