Includes a recipe for a DIY laundry scent booster, plus some safer store bought scent boosters as well. At some point while I was raising my kiddos, I realized that conventional laundry detergent and dryer sheets were not healthy options. So I made the switch over to natural and non-toxic laundry products so that I would not be exposing my family to those harsh chemicals. Now, the laundry detergent I buy is either unscented or very lightly scented with natural ingredients like essential oils. In fact, I've got an entire blog post about my [favorite eco-friendly laundry detergents](https://mindfulmomma.com/eco-friendly-laundry-detergent/). That said, I still want my laundry to come out smelling clean and fresh and sometimes I need a little boost above and beyond my laundry detergent. Instead of opting for scent booster products that are full of potentially toxic chemicals, I started making my own laundry scent booster out of safe and natural ingredients.

[ Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/)) Why Most Scent Boosters Are Bad You may be wondering - what's wrong with most laundry scent boosters sold in the laundry aisle? Let's take a look! Most commercial laundry scent boosters are made with a bunch of chemicals that are linked to negative health effects like reproductive toxicity, skin irritation and allergies, asthma and even cancer. The scents in these products come from synthetic fragrances, which are not only super strong and annoying in my opinion, but can be a mix of many undisclosed chemicals that trigger allergic reactions in many people. One of the most popular scent boosters, [Downy Unstopables In-Wash Scent Booster, is given an F rating](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/2607-DownyUnstopablesInWashScentBoosterFresh/) in the EWG's Cleaning Database. Bottom line, most scent boosters are NOT a safe addition to your laundry routine. So I recommend ditching the Downy scent booster, and either making a homemade laundry scent booster, or opting for a natural laundry scent booster from the store. (learn more about the [health risks from conventional laundry and cleaning products](https://mindfulmomma.com/toxic-cleaning-products-health-risks/)) Why Homemade Laundry Scent Boosters Are Better Much to the chagrin of chemical scientists working for enormous companies, there ARE ways to remove odors and make fabrics smell good, without an overwhelming blast of artificial fragrances insulting your nose and harming your health. A homemade scent booster will infuse your laundry with just enough natural scent to make it smell fresh and clean without being overpowering. Here's why I love my homemade scent booster for laundry: Easy to make - Don't worry - this is not a complicated DIY recipe! As you will see in the recipe below, this laundry booster is made from three simple ingredients, two of which you probably already have in your kitchen cupboards. All you need to do is mix them up into a container and it's ready to use! Natural ingredients - When you make your own scent booster for laundry, you get to use only natural, non-toxic ingredients. The ingredients in my homemade scent booster recipe include kosher salt, baking soda and natural essential oils. Inexpensive - Salt and baking soda are super cheap to purchase in bulk. Expensive essential oils are not needed for laundry as they are primarily used for scent and not for true aromatherapy purposes. I buy inexpensive essential oils for my laundry on [Thrive Market](https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-5461262-12529075?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrivemarket.com%2Fp%2Fnow-foods-essential-oils-lavender) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lavender-Oil-NOW-Glass-Dropper/dp/B01MCVYILF?crid=35XF4BVYI4DZL&keywords=now+lavender+essential+oil+4+oz&qid=1690559603&sprefix=lavender+essential+oil+4+oz+now+%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=90d37ac80800b24b870b556969468991&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (and save the pricier organic essential oils for [body care DIYs](https://mindfulmomma.com/diy-facial-oil/) and personal use.) You can also find affordable essential oils at Whole Foods or a local natural products store near you. Customizable - The fun thing about making your own laundry scent booster is that you can customize the scent to whatever you like best. For laundry, I personally prefer lavender or eucalyptus essential oils, but you can go floral or woodsy or whatever you like! Doubles as a fabric softener - Both salt and baking soda act as natural fabric softeners which is a bonus because it helps you avoid [yet another chemical filled laundry product](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/3123-DownyUltraFabricSoftenerSunBlossom/). Salt is especially helpful if you have hard water because it acts as a water softener. DIY Natural Laundry Scent Booster Recipe If you are up for making your own laundry scent boosters, I've got you covered! Like I said, this homemade version of a laundry scent booster is super easy to make! Toss in a scoop to each load of laundry to add a fresh clean scent to your clothes, towels and bed linens. Ingredients You Will Need: Kosher salt or Epsom salt (1 1/2 cups) - Salt acts to neutralize odors and also to soften fabrics and brighten laundry at the same time (bonus!) I usually use Kosher salt but some people prefer Epsom salts - you can use whichever one you have on hand. Baking soda (1/2 cup) - Baking soda works to both deodorize and soften fabrics. I like to keep a box of baking soda in my laundry room because it's so helpful. Essential oils (30 drops or about 1/2 teaspoon) - This is where you get to add the scent - which is the whole point of a scent booster, right? You get to choose the essential oils that you like best. Or create a combination of different of oils to create your own personal scent. In my opinion, lavender, eucalyptus, lemon, orange or geranium essential oils are all great choices for laundry. How to Make the Laundry Scent Booster: Thoroughly mix the essential oils into the salt. Then mix in the baking soda. (Be sure to mix the salt and essential oils before adding the baking soda. Otherwise, the liquid might active the baking soda.) Store in a covered airtight container (a [wide mouth mason jar](https://www.amazon.com/YEBODA-Canning-Airtight-Preserving-Magnetic/dp/B094XT2QK4?crid=B3LUGXILVPSY&keywords=mason+jars+wide+mouth&qid=1691424438&sprefix=mason+jars+wide+mouth%2Caps%2C107&sr=8-13&linkCode=ll1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=8036d69ecad7447e23429f432cee5ff0&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) or repurposed glass jar works well). Give the mixture a day or two to allow the scent to infuse into salt and baking soda. If it doesn't smell strong enough, you can add a few more drops of essential oils. Use between 2 tablespoons and 1/4 cup per load (a repurposed scoop from laundry detergent is a perfect size). Add the laundry booster directly to the drum of your washing machine or use the fabric softener dispenser if you prefer. By the way, this recipe is safe for top load, front load and HE washers. P.S. If you are looking for homemade laundry detergent, I've never made it myself, but here's a recipe for a [natural laundry detergent powder](https://mommypotamus.com/laundry-detergent/) that you can make if you are so inclined.

The resulting scent will be subtle but will add a nice, fresh scent to your laundry. Note: Only use 100% pure essential oils on dryer balls. Do NOT use fragrance oils or essential oils mixed with a base oil because the oil can be potentially flammable.
