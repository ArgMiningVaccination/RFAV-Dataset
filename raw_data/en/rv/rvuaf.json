A number of measures of subject and treatment characteristics, stress, anxiety and depression will provide the foundation for triangulation of outcomes in order to describe the impact of the various treatment options (standard care, Traditional Healing, combined standard care and Traditional Healing). |Condition or disease||Intervention/treatment||Phase| |Anxiety Depression||Other: Traditional Healing options||Not Applicable| Aboriginal clients, including first nation youth, may not be confident or comfortable with the standard treatments offered by the current Mental Health environment. Incorporating traditional aboriginal healing methods such as dream work, energy healing, healing circles, pipe ceremonies, self care, smudging, sweat lodge and traditional learning into standard practice will provide a culturally sensitive and supportive environment for children, youth and families experiencing stress, anxiety and depression. It is believed that Aboriginal and First Nation clients that access treatment options consistent with cultural beliefs will be encouraged to seek treatment earlier and will experience improved care and outcomes. In addition, the improved understanding of the role of traditional healing methods provided by Aboriginal Healers and Helpers in the management of these disorders will help clinicians incorporate these practices in the management of anxiety and depression |Study Type Traditional Aboriginal Healing Strategies for Depression and Anxiety.
