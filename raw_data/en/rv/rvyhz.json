Watch a video and read more about the DHA's story: More about the Din\u00e9 Hataaii Association DHA developed a one-page written COVID-19 proclamation. The proclamation offered culturally tailored CDC infection control guidelines and Din\u00e9 cultural/spiritual interpretations of the COVID-19 virus. The DHA felt strongly that ceremonies had to continue in a safe manner so by April 10, 2020, they developed the proclamation and disseminated the document to their members. The proclamation offers CDC aligned guidelines on the use ofPPE, postponement of ceremonies if possible, guidelines strongly emphasized hygiene, social distancing and PPE use if and when emergency ceremonies had to be conducted. DHA members transitioned from a face-to-face monthly meeting to zoom-based online meetings. This is impressive for grassroots, traditional, mostly Navajo speaking group of elders and traditional practitioners who have limited broadband, computer and cell phone access and connectivity on the Navajo Nation. DHA prioritized the need to remain in communication to ensure the medicine people remained informed and protected during the pandemic. DHA hosted zoom-based presentations by researchers, scientist and virology and vaccine experts to educate the Hataaii on emerging COVID-19 and vaccine information. DHA provided technology based (zoom/phone calls) spiritual, ceremonial and cultural consultation to relatives and community organizations seeking spiritual guidance, support and ceremony. The use of technology by traditional grassroots elders is unheard of especially for a mostly Navajo speaking group of Din\u00e9 Healers/ practitioners/ herbalist/ medicine people. DHA advocated for the designation of traditional healers (\"the original first responders\"), medicine people, herbalist as CDC category 1-B essential healthcare workers on the Navajo Nation. Their advocacy resulted in medicine people on the Navajo Nation receiving priority consideration as essential healthcare workers on the Navajo Nation, thereby making them eligible to be one of the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in December of 2020 and January of 2021. DHA organized and published several press releases, engaged in radio broadcasts (sharing spiritual & ceremonial guidance and relevant stories) in the Summer of 2020 to advocate for the importance of spiritual practices during COVID-19, and to inform relatives and community members on ways to maintain safety, spiritual strength and protection. In addition, the DHA advocated for the protection and support of independently employed medicine people, members of the DHA. The medicine people had to temporarily halt ceremonies to maintain public health safety however, this resulted in financial losses for the Hataaii (chanters and medicine people). Their public advocacy, persistence and determination led to a response from the community (both on and off the Navajo Nation). Community response in support of the Hataaii included an outpouring and donation of PPE and monetary donations to support the DHA. DHA, a traditional spiritual organization, comprised of spiritualist, Hataaii, herbalist, diagnosticians and cultural wisdom keepers continued ceremonial spiritual offerings for the protection and promotion of health and safety for the entire Navajo Nation. Prayers, songs, offerings and spiritual inquiries and discussions remained steadfast and consistent throughout 2020 and beyond. DHA anticipated severe trauma and emotional distress as the Navajo Nation experienced the loss of so many relatives to COVID-19 and DHA urgently reminded relatives of the need to practice self-care, ceremony and to engage in practices that would enhance spiritual, physical, mental and emotional strength.
