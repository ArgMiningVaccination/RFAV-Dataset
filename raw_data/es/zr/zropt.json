As a resultof this collective effort it has been possible to draw up a detailed picture of the profession which hasbeen described and defined in the new training programme. The process of putting together the training programme and obtaining its approval by the National Commission for Family and Community Medicine, the National Medical Speciality Council, the HumanResources Commission of the Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health System, the Min-istry of Health and Consumer Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture, posed a challenge tofamily doctors: this challenge has resulted in the creation of a tool which is more than just educa-tional and is intended to give a significant boost to the growth of Family and Community Medicine with-in the Spanish National Health System. The implementation of the new specialist training programme for family medicine registrars beginning their training from 2005 onwards, creates an opportunity for the future. Family doctors will start toemerge with greater abilities to solve problems take decisions across the whole health care sys-tem. Furthermore, the new family medicine registrars will demand more of their tutors: because anextra year of training means more to offer greater and improved content andto study new ways to develop learning. The training units are vital components in the system and willparticipate in the entire process. In this way the new programme will help us all to grow, will have agreater influence on the health system and will help solve more of the community's problems. Inshort, there is an opportunity to achieve a more global objective: not just better family doctors, buta greater potential to turn our health system towards a health-focused model. The new programme presents guidelines that will help us to orient health care towards the provision of interventions for which there is better scientific evidence. This is the kind of health care that focus-es on the community and its needs. It is the health care that maintains a balance between curativeinterventions, health promotion and disease prevention. It is a approach as awhole, to the social needs of the local environment and to resources and their management. It is thiscommitment of our speciality, its spirit and its values, that are gathered together in the new pro-gramme. But from now on, the implementation of this programme will require us to start work on its evalua- tion and continuous improvement. Above all, it will require that we consider the future of the special-ity again. This future will be to respond to the needs arising in the health system and which familydoctors will be able to meet in a more integrated way because of the new programme. In the hope that this edition of the new specialist training programme will enable us all to consult and use it, I would like to end my foreword by thanking the thousands of family doctors who work in delivering the characteristic care that the speciality Family and Community their devotion to their profession and the undeniable contribution they make to the developmentof Family Medicine.

New areas have been included, areas specific to thediscipline have been consolidated, new teaching introduced,priorities a framework outlining the essential competencies of a family doctor. This is the frame-work for the academic discipline and professional development. In short, the programme is a reference tool and as such, it must be dynamic and answer and adapt to people's needs. This tool represents a quantitative and qualitative change and we hope it will con-tribute to improving and consolidating Family and Community Medicine and Primary Care. A change in content is one of the most important qualitative changes. We have added professional values, defined professional profile, defined essential, cross-cutting examined them Competencies training and also been developed. programme is not only aimed at training family doctors who are going to work in health centres in the future, but also, due to its wide scope it serves as a basis for subsequent training in other areas,such as emergency care, palliative care, family care, etc, or so that doctors can work in other set-tings, such as accident and emergency departments or other services in both public and private care.Qualitative improvements have been made to the methods involved; individualised training has beenincluded with a gradual com-petency areas and training it based self-directed learning, learn- ing in context, in the classroom, group work and workshops. The first two are fundamental, and theothers complementary, depending on whether it is knowledge, learningskills or improving attitudes. The health centre provides the central training environment for Family and Community Medicine, but there has been an expansion in the training environments: short-stay have stated occasions that this programme is, and will probably continue for some time to be best known for increasing the training time from three to four years rather than for qual-itative changes in training. Nevertheless qualitative changes and only these changes whichdictated the need for increased training time, to correspond to the minimum total training time rec-ommended by the experts who drew up the programme. A great many people have taken part in this process, including family doctors and other als: the two national commissions and bodies they represent, the Ministry of Health and ConsumerAffairs and the Ministry of Education and Science, the scientific societies semFYC and SEMERGEN,the Organisation of Medical Colleges of Spain (OMC), family medicine registrars, the 11 members ofthe editorial committee, 83 writers, bothboards of directors of semFYC, presided by Thomas and Luis Aguilera, who have worked onevery phase of this long process; their working groups; National Medical Speciality Council [CNE]and its commissions; the members of the Human Resources Commission and many people with go-vernment responsibilities, including Ministers Ana Pastor and Elena Salgado, who have made a firmand decisive commitment to the programme, the Aubi\u00e1 andIntroduction|VIV00 26/7/06 P\u00e1gina VConsuelo S\u00e1nchez, the deputy Directors of Professional Regulation, Marc Soler, Emilia S\u00e1nchez Chamorro (subsequently from her post as Deputy Director of Healthcare Science Specialities) andJavier Rubio, who have been the linchpins in the development and approval of this programme; Alfon-so Moreno (president of the National Council of Medical Specialities; the representatives of the healthcentres, and in particular, Nela Garc\u00eda, councillor at the Sub-Head Office for Professional Regulationof the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs, who has played a vital role in drawing up and approv-ing the final version of the programme.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND ProgEspecialidad we have witnessed three important events in primary health care in Spain: the cre- ation of the speciality of Family and Community Medicine (1978), the enactment of the General HealthLaw (1986), and sweeping reforms of primary health care, as initiated by the Royal Decree137/1984 on basic health structures. These changes have led to the introduction of activities health care such in with longer working hours, med-ical history and clinical recording, the time preventive care and health promotion are being addressedthrough training and research in primary care. A number of major social changes have occurred in this country in recent years which have led to an increase in the use of primary care services. These changes include an other lifestyle and environmentalfactors that have created new health care needs and public expectations. The major growth in pri-mary health care also stems from the better range and quality of services, that result from scienti-fic and technological development and improved training and diagnostic skills of family doctors (FDs). This new Family and Community Medicine Training Programme represents a major milestone: it is the third official programme and the fifth actual programme in the 24 years since the speciality wascreated, providing proof of the strength in Spain. Despite the fact that Family and Community Medicine is a young speciality, it has become firmly established and widespread in the healthcare system. out by the fact that over18,000 specialists were trained in 2002, and 5,400 are currently in training. This quantitativebreakthrough has been accompanied by a qualitative one, illustrated by wealth of working etc., by family doctors. From an organisational point of view, the programme has been developed with a high level of con- sensus, as shown by the long list of authors/collaborators included in appendix II. It took over twoyears to develop the programme the Spanish Society for Family and Community Medicine (SemFYC). Of particular interest to our neighbouring countries is the fact that the current programme has extended the training period to four years, as has also happened in other European countries suchas Austria, Denmark and In is approaching the recommendations proposed by theEuropean Union of the European Parliament which even advise extendingthis period to five years. With regard to the contents of the programme, it is relevant to highlight that these meet the pres- ent and future needs of primary health care by allowing the flexible and individual adaptation of workrotations to meet the levels of skill required of a professional family doctor. Minimum, desirable andmaximum standards have been established quality following up and supervising the activities carried out by the family medicine registrars throughout their four-year training period, play a central role in thisprogramme which must be supported simultaneously by a complementary programme of tutor train-ing maintain and family health care, communityhealth care and continuing education and research. Primary health care must be the cornerstone of the health system and this means that high quality training of the family doctors of the future is fundamental, so that they can provide better, moreaccessible, more humane, more integrated and more efficient care for the health service user. Thiscontinues to be the challenge facing family doctors as with development of new teaching methodologies etc. thatcreate the indivisible whole that guarantees quality training and the best medical care for the public. This Programme seeks to provide a dynamic tool, as its predecessors did. This means that it will be revised periodically in order to adapt to the changing needs of scientific developments and of our soci-ety. The National Commission for Family and Community Medicine wishes to express its sincere thanks to everyone has taken part in developing programme, as well as all the family doctors whocontribute on a daily basis to the progress of speciality.Family and Community Programme00 4Profound changes and new taking place in society today are making new demands on health which family doctors cannot ignore. In the face of these changes, their function in society mustnot only focus on improving their levels of training and providing the services required of them, butalso on promoting the values which legitimise their role in society. 2.1. The professional values of the family doctor Doctors possess values which define their professional commitment to society. Learning and theinternalisation of these values are indispensable if they are to do their job properly. Teaching , trans- mitting these job; learning and assimilating them are essential if a family medicine registrar is to become a good family doctor. We can group the values of family doctors into five commitments: To people. To society as a whole. To the continuous improvement of their work. To their own speciality. To ethics. 2.1.1. A commitment to people The individual citizen is the central focus of the care provided by the family doctor, whose interven- tions are geared to improving and which take priority over anyother interests. The public understands the nature of the profession and every effort is made to gainpublic trust so that people will always consult the doctor whenever they need to do so. The best fam-ily doctors endeavour to improve health outcomes of whom they are responsible. Respecting the autonomy of the citizen is not just an ethical duty, but also a healthcare objective . The family doctor provides the information so that patients themselves can decide, in collabo-ration with the doctor, their preferred course of treatment. In this respect, the promotion of caring longer needthem. Their purpose is not to become indispensable to their patients, but to help them learn to lookafter themselves. Every individual matters to the family doctor throughout their entire lives. The doctor's job is not restricted to clinical cases or to dealing with illnesses, problems and a family and social context which con- stitutes an indivisible whole . 2.1.2. A commitment to society Family doctors act as a gateway to the healthcare system, or rather as healthcare agents for thecommunity, or case managers and care pathway coordinators, and as such they have a high level ofsocial responsibility with regard to the efficient use of healthcare resources. They know that the inap-propriate use of healthcare resources (a drug, a complementary investigation, consultation withanother doctor, etc.) not only represents an iatrogenic risk for the patient, but is also an unneces-sary expense which deprives the population of other resources. This is why family doctors have asocial commitment to the efficient use of healthcare and avoid services. profile for those people who require it, avoiding the creation of barriers which hinder access to their servicesor direct access to other more specialised services. To this end, family doctors endeavour to orga-nise their own and their collegues' workload so that they can meet public demand without delay. Family doctors know the importance of their role within the healthcare system, but they perform it with humility, because they are aware of the influence of health care on social and economic factors,and for this reason they identify and work to improve the living conditions of the population they care for. 2.1.3. A doctors make based on updated scientific evidence and must therefore keep their knowledge, skills and professional attitudes up to date, recognising the value of their the possibilities by continuous improvement scientific to the speciality. The professional profile of family doctors and their commitment to people, society and continuous improvement, make them essential professionals in the smooth running of the health system. 2.1.4. A commitment to their own speciality and the training of new professionals The diversity, cross-sectionality and uncertainty with which family doctors not considered a limitation but an inherent characteristic the speciality and an incentive to playing anactive role in the development, consolidation and updating of the training base of this speciality. Family doctors know that improvements can be made to their speciality and this is why they value and take part in training new family medicine registrars , to whom they convey everything limitations, thereby helping the new specialists to be even better than they are . As the tutors of new professionals, family doctors help new generations of family medicine registrars to learn, knowing that they themselves learn from the speciality also willingness to research those questions that are relevant to their job, in order to offer a better service to society. 2.1.5. An ethical commitment Family doctors are very exacting with the healthcare administration and other actors in the health-care system and call for it to be run properly. The limitations of the system do not prevent them frommaintaining an irreproachable ethical attitude in their relationships with their patients, with society as a whole, with the healthcare organisation they work for and with the pharmaceutical industry. The family doctor's ethical commitment is based above all, on respect patient's , guaranteeing their right to privacy and their treatment. In their clinical interven- tions and taking into account their area of work, they put the principle of no-harm before the princi- ple of beneficence of the patient. Family doctors must be particularly careful and honest in their relationships with the pharmaceuticalindustry and in their teaching and research, making sure they the 26/7/06 10:46 P\u00e1gina 62.2. The professional profile of the family doctor The family doctor's profile is that of a professional for whom the person is a physical, psycholog- ical and social whole, embedded in a specific family and social context. This approach enables the doctor to give continuing care to his or her patients, to improve the health of the healthy, cure the sick and to give care, advice and palliation for the effects of the illness, when it is not possible for patients to regain their health. These specific characteristics of the family doctors' professional profile shape a particular body ofknowledge that is fundamentally grounded in their area of activity - Primary Health and theirparticular approach to providing This approach adopts a biopsychosocial which themain driver interventions represented by the following five areas of com- petency, which have a high level of consensus in the European Union. 2.2.1. Training is their ability to communicate with the patients they see every day. It is therefore vital that they develop the ability to listen and empathise so that they can relate to usersin the right way. Family doctors usually see patients with ill-defined health problems, presenting in the early stages of the disease process and which are frequently trivial. This means that they must have the appropri-ate reasoning skills that will allow them conditions by making an very family medicine registrarsthemselves developing and using, can be in learning clinical reasoningand decision-making skills. Family doctors as part of of primary healthcare professionals who have shared objec- tives and care for the same population group. This means they have to learn how to work in a teamand to identify and set common objectives, as well as establishing methods of working and commu-nication between the different professionals involved in health care provision. To carry out their work properly, family doctors must learn how to organise the different aspects of their working day, including the efficient running of their surgery and the effectiveuse clinical and referrals to other specialists. In primary health care, information is the basis of knowledge for diagnosis and decision-making and family doctors must be able to use relevant registers, information and technology systems appropri-ately, ensuring that all data remains confidential. Learning evidence based medicine and the use of Internet resources are fundamental tools in the field of clinical management. Family doctors will learn the theoretical framework and scope of quality in health care and the tools for assessing the structure, process and outcome measures by which quality can be andimproved. The application of these improvement techniques will enable them to assessthe levels of satisfaction of both users and professionals with their work. Family doctors must have necessary to will learn to include the ethical values and attitudes of the profession in their working procedures, both in terms of their relationship with in other areas of their professional duties (prescription, distribution of resources, research, their relationship with the pharmaceutical industry,etc.). 2.2.2. Training area for competencies in individual patient care Family doctors are continu-ous for individuals throughout their lives, both at the surgery and in the home, through appoint-ments, on demand or in emergencies and for acute and chronic complaints. Holistic care (for the whole person) longitudinality (throughout their lives) are two of family doctors' professional role.

Training area for competencies family health care The family plays an important role in the way its members fall ill and the type of illnesses they deve-lop. Family doctors must understand each family as a unit operating in two different ways: as a partof the social context in which life and health unfold, and as a healthcare resource. The family medicine registrar must see the family as a system, undertake a family consultation, draw up and interpret the genogram, know about the life cycle of the family, the transition stages andstressful life events, assessing them and being aware of their repercussions. It is important for family doctors to acquire enable and ate with families. They should know how to identify family resources and the social support networkthat people and their families have, as well as how recognise Programme00 Ingl\u00e9s 26/7/06 10:46 P\u00e1gina 82.2.4. Training area for competencies in community health care In order to improve health and reduce inequalities, family doctors must act on the physical and social determinants of health that are outside the context of the healthcare system. The community dimension of a family doctor's work starts from his or her care of the individual patient and all activity must be contextualised within the person's family and social milieu, making themost of these resources and minimising their weaknesses. With this aim in mind, family doctors must obtain enough information to identify their ethnic background, age, etc., suffer from inequalities inhealth community healthproblems and enabling most vulnerable to access the healthcare system. When providing health care for the community, family doctors must learn on the one hand to use epi- demiological monitoring systems by which they can monitor environmental risks and their healthrepercussions, and on (NGOs, to improve the health of the popula-tion. 2.2.5. Training area for competencies in education and research The family doctor must participate a of etc, as well as collaborating in under-graduateand post-graduate training in family medicine. Family doctors will learn how to perform a literature search, familiarise themselves with the medical databases, information and document resources and how to obtain evidence based information. Family doctors must be able to assess the quality and importance of the research results published in scientific journals, develop the habit of critical reading and the project geared to of clinical epidemiology based med-icine [EBM] so that they can analyse the health of the community for which the basic healthcare team(family doctor and nurse) is responsible.|9800 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s P\u00e1gina 900 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s 26/7/06 10:46 P\u00e1gina 103.1. Links with the professional profile of the family doctor In order to guarantee that the Family and Community Medicine specialist can meet the health demands of today's society, this programme is closely linked to the professional profile of the familydoctor. For this reason the contents of the training programme are divided into training areas whichin turn coincide with the competencies referred to in paragraph 2.2. 3.2. Flexibility The Learning methods: the acquisition of skills by the family medicine registrar is always the final objec- tive and not the method whereby such andnot the 'how'\"; as a result it is envisaged that different learning methods will be used in the differ-ent training areas according to what best suits the educational profile of the tutors and the spe-cific characteristics of the training unit where the family medicine registrar is being trained. Versatility of the training: the Family and provides the necessary knowledge to enable doctors to work, not only in health centres, which provide the natural environ-ment for FM, but in other working environments, where they are particularly in etc.). Increase in venues: in order to improve and broaden the education of family medicine re- gistrars the training programme is open to the inclusion of new types of training resources centres because of the medicine practice in this setting. Elective internships: assessment of training before the end of the third year will make it possible to determine the level of competence acquired. The individualised training of each family medicine registrar with a gradual increase in responsibi- lity tailored to each doctor's personal characteristics. 3.3. The relationship between tutor and family medicine registrar This relationship is the fundamental core of the entire training process, in that the internship systeminvolves programmed theoretical and practical training, with the specialist participating in a personal and progressive way in the training in the relevant interventions and respon-sibilities. Tutors should not only have a sound knowledge of the subject, but must also be available and acces- sible during every phase of the training period, as they play an important role as facilitators and medi-ators of the learning process. The importance of the role of the tutor is demonstrated by the fact that the registrar has the same principal tutor, with whom they will remain in continuous and structured contact throughout theentire learning period, This does not however detract from the role of other tutors or the hospitaltutor, depending on the place where training is taking place at any given time. The principal tutor is responsible for adapting the individual training plan to the training needs and personal characteristics of each registrar, 26/7/06 10:46 P\u00e1gina 113.4. The link between interventions during the training period and programme is its training contents are not just restricted to a simple list of skills, knowledge and aptitudes, but they also provide a useful tool to help both tutor andregistrar to assess the importance and the level of responsibility the registrar acquire for eachof the interventions programmed each of contents for each of gistrars. Levels to identify, assess and manage this type of problem, and in 90% of cases without referral to another level of health care. Secondary level: referral to another level is usually required during the assessment or treatment of this type of problem. Tertiary level: the diagnosis and treatment of these problems fall within the competencies of other specialists, but the family doctor must be able to inform and support the patient and their familyand ensure the coordination and continuity of 3.5. The importance of assessment training necessary. This is which registrars, staff training and including this training programme. and Internet-resource guide One of the core values and approaches of this programme, is to convey to family medicine registrarsthat self-directed learning as well as the expansion and updating of knowledge, is a vital element intraining specialists in Family and Community Medicine that does not end after four years' internship,but represents a permanent professional commitment by the family doctor. For this reason, a bibliographical and Internet-resource guide related to Family Medicine, is given in section 16 and listed in Appendix I. The guide will be updated periodically by the National Commissionfor Family and Community Medicine on this web-site for this programme, by adding new reviews ofthe most important publications from the scientific literature in general and from family doctors them-selves. Family doctors can submit their contributions to the National Commission, which will includethem on the website following a selection process.Family and Community Medicine Training Programme00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s 26/7/06 10:46 12As we stated earlier, one of the specific characteristics of programme the diversity of learn- because is objectives of the pro-gramme, despite its broad variety of profiles of tutors/registrars and the diverse char-acteristics and resources of the many training units accredited to train these specialists. To this effect, the five recommended learning methods in the different areas of competence of this programme are: 4.1. Self-directed learning This involves: the study and use of individual learning tools. It is particularly suitable for: acquiring new knowledge, maintaining competencies, use of basic tools (English, computers, Internet). Different models: - Everyday study problem-based learning, practical - Distance-learning courses.- Preparing sessions. 4.2. Learning in context This involves: putting the family medicine registrar in a real situation in which self-directed learn- ing can take place. It is particularly suitable for: learning about the complexity of functions and decision-making as a professional. Different models - Direct observation (the family medicine registrar sees what the tutor is doing).- Tutored interventions (the family medicine registrars carry out their interventions in the presence of the tutor). - Direct intervention, not supervised directly by the tutor (information is obtained in different ways from direct observation: audit of case histories, the patient's opinion, the opinion of other col-leagues in the team or from secondary care). - Video recordings made in the doctor's surgery (with the patient's consent) and subsequent analysis. 4.3. involve: teacher-centred a specific subject.

These services, which will be provided atthe training unit facilities, will be compulsory and be supervised by the associates and tutors at thehealthcare centres where they are carried out, with the help of the coordinator from the training unit. From an educational point of view, the recommended number of duty periods should be no fewer than three, nor greater than five a month, even in the case of accumulated duty periods resulting from holi-day leave. In any case, the coordinator and tutors from the training unit will plan the duty periods and other activities for the family medicine registrars, bearing in mind their dual function as trainee staff andworkers at the healthcare units and centres where they are undergoing training.

This will favour the prudent practice of family medicine. Furthermore, the appearance of ethical conflicts in the everyday practice of family medicine is becom- ing a more and more frequent occurrence: conflicts not related with pharmaceutical industry, preventive interventions, use of resources, etc. Familydoctors must be able to deal with such conflicts and assess the pos-sible ways of resolving them and try to select the best one for each case.

This teaching area is subdivided into two large groups, the first concerning the approach to health- care needs and health problems (9.1) set out in subsections according to organ or and asecond two situations are worthy of particular mention as they are common to all groups:The patient with multiple pathologies: this type of patient is a very frequent service user whose multiple pathologies require an integrated care process. The patients with a rare disease: while it is true that the family doctor's job revolves around the management of the most common pathologies, it is no less true that they should have sound know-ledge of rare since they are the point of referral for these patients. Ideally, the family manage provide the crite-ria for referral to secondary or tertiary care. In these cases, the approach should once again bebiopsychosocial, they must be aware of self-help groups, provide genetic advice and dilemmas.

The training unit will adapt and combine all these methods according to the particular charac-teristics of the place where registrars are undergoing training and their needs. This replaced by other training methods if the training benefits from theseinternships are not sufficient. We recommend 100 hours of theory and practical classes distributedthroughout the four years of training, in order to acquire and improve clinical competencies in eachof the areas of individual health care, population groups and at-risk groups. C) ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY In these areas, direct tutoring by the tutor or person in charge of the department will be the mostsuitable way of assessing the extent to which the aims have been acquired, although we recommendobjective and standardised instruments be included in this methodology.

Thismeans that replaced by other training methods if the training ben-efits from these internships are not sufficient. We recommend 100 hours of theory and practicalclasses distributed throughout the four years of training, in order to acquire and improve clinical com-petencies in each of the areas of individual health care, population groups and at-risk groups.

Barcelona: Ib\u00e9rica; 90The family plays a vital role in the processes of health and illness of its members as anyone who has worked in primary healthcare will have observed in practice. This phenomenon can be seen from atleast four different perspectives: 1. The family is the main source of care when one of its members falls ill. 2. Family characteristics can determine the relationship of its members to the health system.3. Family dysfunction can play an important role in the appearance and continuation of the disease.4. There are different patterns of family response to the appearance and development of diseases. It is also common knowledge that the health of a community depends to a large extent on the biopsy- chosocial health of its family networks. Therefore, the family is not only an important variable in theprevention of disease and the promotion of health, but becomes essential in care, rehabilitation is Community Medicine registrars to gradually develop the foundations for their future work in fam-ily health care. This programme therefore reviews the theory and family care on carepractice, specifying the different levels and models of intervention general objectives, and differen-tiating between a family orientated (or anticipatory assessment), from a family systemsapproach to clinical practice, right up to the level of family therapy. Basically, we use the term family orientated approach to refer to the attitude of the professional. From this perspective the individual symptom or demand is a reference, regardless of whether not the family is present during the consultation. Itis not a case of substituting care of the individual for care of the family; on the contrary, it is aboutimagining the patient within their family context and taking the as a reference presented. two funda-mental premises: the acceptance of the biopsychosocial model and the incorporation of a holistic per-spective. The second model is somewhat more complex, and attains the fourth level of intervention, as it requires specific training to detect and neutralise dysfunctions that may exist in the family circle. Wecall this process the family systems approach as we act on the family system using a specific thera- peutic intervention. By situations exist in whichinterventions across the entire family as can offer advantages over the individual approach. Weconsider that the family consultation is the basic intervention tool for this type of approach. Finally, and as Priority III, we recommend therapy] that does not require the symptoms to be defined as psychological in order for them to be treated. Its theoretical founda-tions also lie in the general theory of systems and communication theory, as well as radical construc-tivism.

Family medicine registrars must be aware that good family doctors cannot just them-selves to surgery; with thehealthcare needs of the population under community interventions,as a health promotion strategy, are among their functions. Training in community care includes a wide variety of knowledge and skills, which are also based on individual care at the doctor's surgery. It is important that family medicine registrars see the linksbetween individual and community care and the bridges that need to be built between both, therebyavoiding them being viewed as independent From surgery, the context of the patients within community, both in the analysis of their problemsas well as in possible interventions. They must recognise the limits of their actions in the surgeryitself and know which community resources it to profes-sionals who work specifically in This does not preclude however specific It is resources that empower citizens and help themshare and play a central role in health care and its promotion.

Supervision of medical records, checking to see if the social and community context has been taken into account and the resources available to the community have been made good use of. B) Group work Role-play based on interviews with key informants from the group vities, meetings other more on knowledge than attitudes, and as a result bear in mind the objective of promoting attitudes that will recognise the importance of empowerment and real and active prominence of the community and their organisations in promoting and look- ing after their health, and the role of the family doctor as the facilitator of this process. During the training process, particular be taken over the attitudes shown, at least as much as if not more than knowledge and skills. RECOMMENDED PLACES OF LEARNING Health Centre to which the family medicine registrar is assigned. This must include activities that non-medical professionals can take part in and social workers). Care provided through specific other with the community, care interventions at many accredited health centres, it may be necessary to draw on wider training resources and find ways of linking up with the health centres that have the required partnerships with community planning by the training units and the collaboration of all tutors. Some of the time assigned to the health centre during year two of the internship could also be devoted to this type of training and suitable centres chosen for this purpose. RECOMMENDED LEARNING TIME During years one, two and three, theoretical and practical work through self-directed learning,group work, classes and 30 hours should begiven to theoretical and practical training through group work, classes and workshops. Some of the time assigned to health centres in year two can be devoted to this type of training, choosing centres which are more active in community work. Practical training will mainly take place during year four, not through a dedicated period, but through learning in context and by othertraining activities. The time devoted to practical training in this area during year four should range from an obligato- ry minimum of 5% of overall training time to a maximum of 10%. In view of the fact that participa-tion in training activities in this area work dedicated is calculated by activities tak-ing up half a working day, meaning that the total number of [half-day] training activities to be car-ried out throughout the year will range from an obligatory minimum of 22 activities (one every twomonths and 12 days fully dedicated to training) and a maximum of 44 activities (one every weekand 24 days fully dedicated to training). RECOMMENDED ASSESSMENT Supervision of consultation given by the family record and of patient-centred clinical surgery and the use of resources available to the com-munity in each case. Assessment of prepared give specialvalue the participation of the community in the processes.

Education and training Family and Community Medicine specialists face the daily challenge of keeping abreast of the ever- growing body of knowledge, skills and attitudes that shape their specialist area. In this respect healthservices, scientific societies and different professional groups run continuing medical education pro- grammes whose basic mission is to family with the necessary tools to maintain andimprove their competencies, both with regard to knowledge as well as skills and attitudes. The imple-mentation of in the form of a tutor-centredtalk or classic text book. They will also include such as individualisation greater specificity of educational sources and subjects.As the need for family doctors to update their skills increases, the need and responsibility to adaptto and management technologies also increases exponentially: which must be of the primary healthcare team. Throughout the internship period, family medicine registrars must be made aware of the current and future need to undertake continuing medical education activities. They should take part in continuingmedical education at their health centre in order to internalise the need for it to form a part of theirprofessional lives, as an essential way of guaranteeing their patients appropriate health care.In short, their medicine registrars must internalise the fact that continu-ing training and the accreditation of professional competence is a guiding principle of the practice ofhealth care, described by article 12 of Law 44/2003 for the Regulation of Healthcare Professionsas \u00aba right and a duty\u00bb which must be required of the Health Institutions where they provide servic-es future. 12.1.1. education In continuing education, it is needs, subsequent-ly training activities There are a number ofprogrammes designed with this aim in mind, which will be useful to family doctors, with a broad spec-trum of their professional lives. Continuing education, as stipulated in article 37 of Law 44/2003, mentioned previously, and article 40 of Law 55/2003, which approved the Framework Statute for Statutory Health Service Person-nel, will be a fundamental tool for the acquisition of the levels of \u00abprofessional development\u00bb and \u00abpro-fessional career\u00bb completion of and for practising family patients. 12.1.2. Updating knowledge through new technologies As is the case with other professions, the computerisation of medical knowledge and the organisa-tion of health care must be one of the main features of training and continuing education activities inmedicine. Of all the medical specialities, family medicine needs to place particular emphasis on updat-ing to new technologies, due to its particular communication needs, information and managementwith regard to the community, its patients and the rest of the health system. In order to do this, ithas at its disposal a variety of media such as the publication in electronic format of many specialistjournals in the field, congresses organised by scientific societies, the development of multimediateaching tools courses or contents training area for competencies in education,training and research00 ProgEspecialidad Ingl\u00e9s 26/7/06 10:46 P\u00e1gina 103The internet is an essential tool where resources can be found free of charge for continuing medical education appropriately geared to the general public or to a specific group of professionals. There are many advantages to acquiring competencies in these technologies itself, duringthe training period, but during the registrar's future professional life, enabling them to learning consisting of virtual tuition, on-line The popularity of the internet has given patients greater access to medical information. The traditio- nal inequality in scientific and medical information between doctor and patient is beginning to fade, with the added problem that patients can access more information which is also incorrect or unneces-sary. All family doctors must have access to the medical information used by their patients and haveat their disposal the internet resources provided by universities, the pharmaceutical industry andcommunication companies which provide them with free access to updated information, search toolsto find abstracts of articles [available etc. Doctors caninclude routine screenings or checks in these information systems to remind them of the most advis-able steps to take. It is likely that the technologies will become more and more simple and thereforeeasier to use although this in turn, will involve new possibilities and technologies which doctors willhave to keep abreast of. The implementation of the Family and Community Medicine Programme through the training units, must guarantee that registrars are familiar enough with all the communication technologies and theinformation to use them in their future careers and to incorporate new technologies when theyappear. OBJECTIVES On completion of their training, family medicine registrars will: 1. Know about systems for determining training deficits and opportunities for improving competen- cies. 2. Know about and manage the usual sources of professional training and information.3. Be able to draw up an individualised training plan, geared to the improvement of competencies.4. Be able to train themselves in the basic skills necessary for the acquisition and transmission of knowledge. .Family and Community Medicine Training Programme TRAINING ACTIVITIES critical of progress during training PRIMARY and of the extent to which plans are used during the internship. > To perform a analysis of the range of training PRIMARY activities offered with regard to their suitability and quality. > To know the different teaching methodology tools for PRIMARY/SECONDARY the acquisition attitudes. transmission of knowledge. > To deliver clinical training sessions of high quality PRIMARY > To present papers at medical research forums.

Sessions/Seminars organised by the training unit throughout the internship Quality research must be encouraged as a fundamental tool to generate knowledge and contribute to the progress of the health system, fostering the transferral of research outcomes to clinical prac-tice in order to its effectiveness. Research is all healthcare levels and for all health-care professionals, because it is a way of achieving innovations make it possible to provide effi-cient and better quality care. Primary care is the first point of contact provided by the health service to individuals and the popula- tion in a continuing, integral and integrated way, regardless of age, gender, state of health or illness.However there is a particularly striking difference between the high levels of care provided at primarylevel and its scant presence in current research. Among the reasons which dictate the need for a change in this respect, we find: The existence of uncertainty in the professional practice of family doctors. Uncertainties in their daily work are almost infinite and as a result there are many questions that require answers. other healthcare areas. Another differen- tiating factor is that while other areas can only carry out research into disease, mortality and hightechnology, primary care is the only level that can research into health as well. Nevertheless theresults of research undertaken in primary treating\u00abideal\u00bb of their illness and from selected age groups which do not matchthe patterns of the real population treated by family doctors their surgeries. It is therefore impor-tant that the clinical practice of the family doctor should raise questions and seek the best answersfor patients at this healthcare level. In this respect the area in which research is conducted can sig-nificantly shape the results and the way these transferred to practice- This in turn affects thetrue estimate of tests used expected response to treatment. There is an on-going relationship with patients in primary care which provides an opportunity to observe them over uninterrupted periods of time and in their family, working and social environ-ments. The sector retains an enquiring spirit: research initiatives are relatively common, as shown in the major contributions to primary care congresses and scientific meetings or journals in the field.Many of these projects are descriptive, precise studies which with the right support, could lead toquality lines of research. Lack of knowledge about the factors that condition the health of our fellow citizens, the natural his- tory of the disease, the health services or the type of care we provide, costs society dear, both ineconomic terms and in and social well-being. The continuing accumulation of fact-based knowledge is the cornerstone of progress and primary care cannot be an exception to the rule.

To achieve this aim and without this precluding adaptation at a future date to whatever changes may be envisaged in the legislation for the development of Law 44/2003, of 21st November the Re-gulation by the Communities ofSpain in the application of what is envisaged in this law, the following individuals and bodies are con-sidered fundamental to the correct programme of the speciality of Familyand Community Medicine: The principal tutor will be responsible for the family medicine registrar's training and learning process, during the time spent at the health centre and outside it and will be the same one dur-ing the entire education period, undertaking continuing and structured contact the registrarthroughout this period. It is recommended that each of the principal tutors have assigned to thema maximum of two family medicine registrars at the same time. The tutor must be a specialist inFamily and Community Medicine, without to in sec-tion 13.1.3 of this programme. The support tutor. In addition to the principal tutor, family medicine registrars will also have sup- port tutors specialising in Family and Community Medicine. Principal tutors can be the supporttutors for other family medicine registrars. The hospital tutor is responsible for coordinating and supervising the training of family medicine registrars during of training. dependon the number of family medicine registrars on rotation in the hospital. The hospital tutors will haveprofessional experience in accordance with the function they are expected to perform, and if theyare Family and Community Medicine specialists this will be particularly valued. Training associates are specialists and professionals from the different sections of the training unit where the family medicine registrars are working on a rotation basis. Although they tutors and Community Medicine, contribute to the of this programme rotations. are therefore required be Family and Community Medicine spe-cialists. Public are the although not tutors, contribute to the theoretical practical training and research envisaged in the programme undertaken at thetraining unit. They are specialists in Family and Community Medicine, preventive medicine and pu-blic health, and can also be professionals with accredited training in teaching and researchmethodology and the theoretical and practical blocks of the Family and Community Medicine train-ing programme. The training unit coordinator is responsible for the management, planning and organisation of the training unit and also carries out assessments/monitoring, training and research, and the man-agement and coordination of the training interventions of the primary care tutors. The training unitcoordinator must be a specialist in Family and Community Medicine. The Training Unit Advisory Commission is the collegial body which organises education, supervis- es its practical application and checks to ensure the training unit fulfils the Spain accord- ing to the characteristics and structure of the training units within their jurisdiction. 13.1. Tutors and their relationship with the registrar and management Tutors are actively working, medical professionals, who are recognised as having a suitable level of training and working environment which qualify them to impart the knowledge, skills and attitudes|111 Ingl\u00e9s specialised They assume responsibility for playing an active in the teaching and learning process of specialist doctors in training, within an institutionalised context. The tutor is a unique figure in the family medicine registrar's training process. This means that the distinctions at the beginning of this section (principal tutor, support tutor, hospital tutor) are madeaccording to how closely the tutor is associated with the family medicine registrar in individual terms,without there being any hierarchy among any of these figures. The tutor is a key figure in training family medicine registrars, particularly in the context of this pro- gramme which has flexibility as one of its defining characteristics. This flexibility involves individu-alisation programme adapting the contents, training times andmethods to the needs of each family medicine registrar. Tutors must meet two basic criteria: Be a good family doctor: their competencies and experience must fit in with those described in this programme. Be a good trainer, as the quality of the training obtained by the family medicine registrar will depend on the tutor's attitude to training, their preparedness, their to convey knowledge andthe way they handle interpersonal relationships. The tutor must plan, stimulate, direct, monitor and assess the family medicine registrar's learning process, by performing the functions stipulated in paragraph 7.3 s\u00e9ptimo. 3 of the Order of 22ndJune 1995, and should therefore: Give guidance to family medicine registrars throughout the entire training period. To do this, the tutor must help them identify their learning needs and the objectives of each rotation, both at the hospital and the health centre; establish their individual training plan with them and, if neces-sary, the elective internships they have to take part in, informing them about other activities ofinterest to their training. Supervise the family medicine registrar's training. With this aim in mind, the tutor must: - Use the training specifications included in this programme as a basic tool, complemented by the information provided by the hospital tutor and the other people responsible for supervising the training programme. - Establish a calendar of regular meetings or interviews with the family medicine registrar they are tutoring, to jointly analyse how training is progressing and to try and rectify any weak points. Be the family medicine registrar's key advocate and as such provide support and ensure they are kept informed. The tutor is the key element in resolving conflicts and in protecting the registrar's rights. Foster self-directed learning and the progressive acquisition of responsibility by the registrar. Foster the registrar's training and research skills. Be the main person responsible for training assessment or the continuous assessment of the fam- ily medicine registrar, playing an active part in the yearly/qualitative assessment through theassessment commissions. Take part in drawing up the annual report about the teaching activities carried out by the family medicine registrars at the health centre. 13.1.1.

The hospital tutor Tutors will be appointed by the hospital manager/director together with other doctors from the insti- tution who have the professional experience suited to the functions the tutor has to perform. Familyand Community Medicine specialists this will be particularly valued. From a training point of view, and within the framework of the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995, hospital tutors must: Be members of the Advisory Commission of the Family and Community Medicine training unit. Be members of the Assessment Committee of family medicine every aspect of the education programme at the hospital, together with the training unit coordinator: duty periods, rotations, etc. Advise the Family and Community Medicine training unit on all issues related to the in-hospital train- ing of family medicine registrars.

The training associate and public health specialist in the Family and Community Medicine Programme 13.3.1. The training associate The role of the training associate is specified in article 104 of the General Healthcare Law 14/1986 and article 22 of Law 45/2003 for the Regulation of Healthcare Professions which envisages theavailability of all the structures of the health system to be used in the specialised, continuous under-graduate training of professionals. In this context, training associates are specialists and professionals who are not tutors of family medi- cine registrars, but trainers in different sections of the training unit. They are responsible for trainingfamily registrars during sections. nurses, physiotherapists, midwives, etc.], but con-tribute to the training of family medicine registrars will have the support of the training associates. From a training point of view, training associates must: Give guidance to family medicine registrars throughout the entire training period in their unit or service. Supervise the family medicine registrar's training using the training specifications included in this programme as a basic tool, completed with the information provided by the hospital tutor and prin-cipal tutor. Be the family medicine registrar's key advocate during the training period and consequently, pro- vide support and ensure they are kept informed.

The public health specialist All the training units for the correct implementation of the programme will have public health specialistson their staff. The number of specialists and the amount of time they devote to the unit will depend onthe number of family medicine registrars undergoing healthcare professionals who are not tutors of family medicine re- gistrars, but who carry out the tasks entrusted to them by the training unit coordinator, which aredesigned to facilitate the implementation of the theoretical and practical programme of the speciali-ty. They take part in the training and research activities at the training unit and health centre gearedto improve the education of residents as well as tutors. From a training point of view, and within the framework of the functions assigned to public health technicians in the Ministerial Order of 22nd June 1995, these professionals must: Be members of the Advisory Commission, and teach the courses and modules that are part of the programme, and collaborate with the coordinator in planning and adapting it to the characteris-tics of the corresponding training unit.

An additional way of indexing these resources is the classificationaccording to the most frequently encountered clusters at family medicine practices in the UnitedStates. The focus of the selection of resources in this directory is based on the criteria of evidence based medicine and it reviews them resources include links to lectures and other types of docu- ments which do not fit within the concept of clinical practice guidelines in the strict sense, eventhough they are of unquestionable interest. Together with the guide directory, the site also includesother Internet links and brief summaries of the basic concepts of primary care.

The themes are also classified by clinical areas that are updated every month, and a Virtual Learn- ing Centre has been launched, which features a course in continuing medical education. This isundoubtedly one of the main tools when looking for secondary information and when a quick overviewof a subject of clinical importance is needed. However, it is important to bear in mind that the siteis a selection of quality resources, rather than a comprehensive source of information, and for thisreason the searches will not always be satisfactory. 3.3.
