Experimental Design 2.1.1 Method Description 2.1.1.1 This describes environments or spiked with compounds in the laboratory. A single test method is outlined that may be used is conducted for 10 d in I L glass chambers containing 175 mL of sediment and 800 rnL of overlying water. Overlying water is not renewed, and test organisms are not fed during the toxicity tests. Temperature and salinity of overlying water. and choice of control sediment (i.e.. negative control). are species-specific. The choice of reference sediment may he species-specific under applications. endpoint toxicity test is survival. and reburial of surviving amphipods is an additional measurement can be used as an endpoint. Procedures are described for use with from marine environments. 2.1.2 Experimental Design. following is a general summary of experimental design. See sediment (sometimes a negative control). A control sediment is a sediment that is essentially free of contaminants and is used routinely to assess the acceptability of a test and is not necessarily collected near the site of concern. Any contaminants in control sediment are thought to originate from the global spread of pollutants and do not reflect any substantial input from local or non- point sources (Lee et al., 1994). A control sediment provides a measure of test acceptability. evidence of test organism health, and a basis for interpreting data obtained from the test sediments. A reference sediment is collected near an influence the response test organisms (DeWitt et al.. 1988). The physico-chemical characteristics of test sediment must be within the tolerance limits of the test organism. Ideally. the can be evaluated if the limits are exceeded in a test the tolerance limits of the test organism. it 16 may be desirable to include a control sediment that encompasses those to choose a test organism with tolerance limits that are not by the in question. The some sediment on the results of sediment may be able to be addressed with regression equations (DeWitt et al.. Ankley et 1993). 2.1.2.2 The experimental design depends on the purpose of the study. Variables that need to be considered include the number and type of control sediments. treatments replicates, and water For instance. the purpose of study might to determine a specific endpoint such as an LC50 and may positive control. and several sediment spiked a A useful of field sampling design is presented by Green ( 1979). See Section 12 for additional guidance on experimental design and statistics. 2.1.2.3 If the purpose of the study is to conduct a reconnaissance field survey to identify each site to allow for maximum spatial coverage. The lack of replication at a site usually precludes statistical comparisons (e.g.. ANOVA). these to In other instances, the purpose of the study might be to of replicates per site should be based on the need for sensitivity or power (Section 12). In a quantitative survey. replicates (separate samples from different grabs collected at the same site) would need to be taken at each site. Chemical and physical characteristics of each of these grabs would be required for subsamples Therefore, replicate samples characteristics. in relation to the boundary of a disposal site. or at sites identified as being contaminated in a reconnaissance survey. Both spatial and temporal comparisons can be made. In pre- dredging studies, a sampling design can be prepared to assess the contamination of samples representative of focus of the physical and experimental test design. and statistical analysis of the data. is the experimental unit. The experimental unit is defined as the 17 smallest physical entity to which treatments can be independently assigned (Steel and Torrie. I!MO) and to which air exchange between test chambers are kept to a minimum. Is the number of test chambers per treatment increases, the number of degrees of freedom increases. and. therefore, the width of the confidence interval on a point e\\tirnate. such as an LC50, and the power Because of results within test chambers and results of a test, all test chambers should be similarly as possible. of test organisms to test chambers should be non-biased. 2.2 Types of Tests 2.2.

Sediment collection, handling, and storage may alter bioavailability and concentration by changing the physical, chemical, or biological complicate the interpretation of effects. Direct comparisons of organisms exposed in the laboratory and in the field would be useful to verify laboratory field.

It occurs on the Atlantic coast from central Maine to central Florida. although it is also found in the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico (Bousfield. 1973). On the Pacific coast, it is present in San Francisco Bay, CA (Nichols et al.. 1985: Hopkins, 1986). They are small (adult length 4 to 8 mm). laterally compressed amphipods. are often a dominant food source for bottom-feeding fish (Richards, 1963). The tubes are narrow and approximately 2 to 3 cm in A feeder, A. abdita feeds in waters that range in salinity from fully marine to 10% (Hyland, 1981). Laboratory tests have shown the salinity application range of A. abdita in sediments is from 0 to 34% when the salinity of overlying water is [ 28% (Weisberg et al.. 1992). This species generally inhabits sediments from fine sand to mud and silt without shell fragments. although it can also be relatively component. sediments with a high organic content. Analysis historical data shows little effect grain size of A. tests (Long and Buchman. 1989; Weisberg et al.. 1992). There is evidence that sediments with >95% sand may elicit -2 to 27\u00b0C (J. Scott, SAIC, Narragansett. RI, and M.S. Redmond, Northwest Aquatic Sciences, Newport, unpublished data). Reproduction patterns of A. vary its two generations per year. an over-wintering population that broods in the spring, and a second that breeds in mid- to late-summer (Mills, 1963). In warmer waters of Cape Hatteras, NC, breeding might be continuous throughout the year (Nelson, 1980). Juveniles are released after approximately two weeks in the brood pouch. Juveniles take approximately 40 to 80 d for released juveniles to become breeding adults under a free-burrowing amphipod in Haustoriidae. It is found on protected and semi-protected beaches from the lower intertidal to shallow subtidal waters exclusively on the Pacific coast from British Columbia south to central California (Environment Canada, 1992). They are stout (adult size esfuarius It is an estuarine species and has been reported in areas where pore water salinity ranges from 1 to 25% 53 (Environment Canada. 1992: R. Caldwell.

It is common in protected embayments hut has been collected in channels of estuarine rivers up to depths of 10 m (Holland et al.. 1988: Schlekat et al., 1992). and has been reported to occur in depths up to 13 m (Shoemaker. 1932). They are relatively large amphipods (adult length up to 1.3 cm) with cylindrically shaped bodies that are brownish-grey in color. A distinguishing feature is a series of dark bands or stripes that cross the dorsal surface of the pareons and pleons. In Chesapeake Bay, densities of L. plumulosus can reach 28,987/m2 and 24.133/m2 in sandy and muddy sediments. respectively (Holland et al., 1988). It feeds on particles that are in suspension and on the sediment surface (Dewitt et al., 1992a). plumulmsus is found both oligohaline and mesohaline regions of east coast estuaries: ambient water salinity at collection sites has ranged from 0 to 15%, (Holland et al., 1988: Dewitt et al., 1992a: Schlekat et al., 1992; McGee et al.. 1994). Laboratory studies have demonstrated a salinity application range in control sediments 0 to 32% (Schlekat et al., 1992: SAIC, 1993b). It is most often a high proportion of particulate organic material, although it has been collected in fine sand with some organic content (Jordan and Sutton, 1984; Holland et al.. 1988; Marsh and Tenore. 1990; Dewitt et al., 1992a; Schlekat et al.. 1992: McGee et al.. 1994). Analysis of historical data for L. plumulosus reveals no effect be seasonally ephemeral. with growth occurring in spring and large population declines occurring in summer due to action.. of predatory fish (Hines et al.. 1986) or absence of essential micronutrients (Marsh amphipod in the family Phosocephalidae. It occurs on the Pacific Coast from Puget Sound, WA, to central California in lower intertidal and nearshore subtidal zones to depths and Swartz. et al., 1985: Barnard and Barnard, 1982). Densities in the field are reported to range from 150 to 2200/m2 (Lamberson and Swartz. 1988: Swartz et al.. 1985). It is a medium-sized 54 (adult length from 3 to >5 mm) amphipod a rounded from to yellowish, grayish-brown to white with a pinkish- brown hue (Environment Canada, 1992). Rhepoxynius material (Oakden, In the field. R. abrmius is found where pore water salinity is no lower than 20 %r (Environment Canada. 1992).

All individuals in a test must be from the same source, because different populations may exhibit different sensitivities to contaminants. areas from the low intertidal zone to depths of 60 m. On the .Atlantic Coast, A. abdita ranges from central Maine to south- central Florida and the eastern Gulf of Xlexico. It can also be found on the Pacific Coast in San Francisco Bay.

It is also important (1) number of organisms) for assignment to the control and test treatments (e.g., a bias in the results may occur if all the largest animals are placed in the same treatment), (2) randomize the allocation of sediment (e.g., not take all the sediment in the top of a jar for the control and the bottom for spiking), and (3) randomize exposure chambers is critical to the avoidance of a common error in design and analysis termed (Hurlbert, 1984). Pseudoreplication occurs test for treatment effects even though the treatments are not replicated or the are statistically independent (Hurlbert, 1984). The simplest form of pseudoreplication is the treatment of subsamples of the experimental unit as true replicates. For example, two aquaria are prepared, one with control sediment, the other with test sediment, and 10 organisms are response and do not replicate the treatment (i.e., sediment type). In this case, the experimental unit is the 10 organisms and each organism is a the error due to the physical segregation of exposure chambers by treatment. For example, if all the control exposure chambers are placed in one area of a room and all the test exposure chambers are in another, spatial effects (e.g., different lighting, temperature) could bias the results for one set of treatments. Random physical intermixing of the exposure chambers or randomization of treatment location may be necessary to avoid this type of can be treatment, and applying the treatments to each experimental unit in a manner that includes physical intermixing (interspersion) and purpose is to determine if the biological response to a treatment sample differs from the response a control sample. Table 12.1 presents the possible outcomes and decisions that can be reached in a statistical test of such a hypothesis. The null hypothesis is that no difference exists among the mean control and treatment responses. The alternative hypothesis of greatest interest in sediment tests is that the are toxic, or contain concentrations of 12.2.3.1 Statistical tests of hypotheses can be for the chances of making incorrect decisions. Table 12.1, alpha (CL) represents the probability of making a Type 1 statistical error. A Type I statistical error in this testing situation results from the false conclusion that the treated sample is toxic or contains chemical residues not found in the control or reference sample. Beta (p) represents the probability of making a Type II statistical error, or the likelihood that one erroneously concludes there are no differences among Traditionally, acceptable values for a have ranged from 0.1 to 0.01 with 0.05 or 5% used most commonly. This choice should depend upon having chosen a, environmental researchers have ignored p associated power of the test (l-p). 12.2.3.2 Fait-weather (1991) presents a review of the need for, and the practical implications of, conducting power analysis in environmental monitoring studies. This review also includes a comprehensive bibliography of recent publications on the need for, and use of, power analyses in environmental study design and data analysis. The consequences of a Type 11 statistical error in environmental studies should never be ignored and may in fact the most important criteria to consider in experimental designs and Fait-weather (IuSl), \"The commitment of time, energy and people to a false positive (a Type I error) will only continue until the mistake is discovered. In contrast, the cost of a false negative (a Type II error) will have both short- and long-term costs (e.g., ensuing environmental degradation rectification).\" 12.2.3.3 The criticaI components of the experimental test of hypothesis outlined above are: (1) the required MDD between the and control or reference responses, (2) the variance among treatment and units, (3) the number of replicate units for the treatment and control samples, (4) the number of animals exposed within a replicate exposure chamber, and (5) the selected probabilities of Type I (~a) and Type II (p) errors.

To test the equality of the control and treatment responses, a two-sample t-test with its associated assumptions is the appropriate parametric analysis. If the desired MDD, the number of replicates per treatment, the number a control sample, are available, it is possible to use a graphical approach as in Figure 12.1 to determine how likely it is that a 20% reduction will be detected in the treatment response relative to the control response. The CV is defined as 100% x (standard deviation divided by the mean). In a test design with 8 replicates per treatment and with an a level of 0.05. high power (i.e., 9.80) to detect a 20% reduction from the control mean occurs only if the CV is 15% or less (Figure 12.1). The choice of these variables also affects the power of the test. If 5 replicates are used per treatment (Figure 12.21, the CV needs to be 10% or lower to detect a 20% reduction in response relative to the control mean with a power of 90%. 12.2.3.1, Relaxing the a level of a statistical test increases the power of the test. Figure 12.3 duplicates Figure 12.1 except that o! is 0.10 instead of 0.05. Selection of the appropriate a level of a test is a function of the costs associated with making Type I and II statistical errors. Evaluation of Figure 12.1 illustrates that with a CV of 15% and an a level of 0.05, there is an 80% probability (power) of detecting a 20% reduction in the mean treatment response relative to the control mean. However, if a is set at 0.10 (Figure 12.3) and the CV remains at lS%, then there is a 90% probability (power) of detecting a 20% reduction relative if an is desirable. Increasing the number of replicates per treatment will increase the power to detect a 20% reduction in treatment relative to less than X replicates per treatment it is difficult to have high power (i.e., A.80) unless the CV is less than 15%. If space cost limit the number of replicates to fewer than 8 per treatment, then it may be necessary to find ways to reduce the among replicate reduce biological variability or increasing the a level of the test.

In the tests described is the number of replicates (i.e., exposure chambers) in an individual treatment, not the number of organisms in an exposure chamber. Overall sample size N is the combined total of replicates all treatments. The statistical methods discussed this section are described in general statistics texts such as Steel and Torrie (1980), Sokal and Rohlf (1981), Dixon and Massey (1983), Zar (1984), and Snedecor and Cochran (1989).

In general, parametric statistical analyses such t-tests and analysis of variance are appropriate only if: (1) there are independent, replicate experimental units for each treatment, (2) the observations within each treatment follow a normal distribution, and (3) variances for both treatments are equal or similar. The first assumption is an essential component of experimental design. The second and third assumptions can be tested using the data obtained from the experiment. Therefore, before analyses. from a normal distribution (e.g., a log-normal distribution) are the most common causes of departures from normality or equality of variances. An inconsistent or questionable data point that appears unrepresentative of the general trend exhibited by the majority of the data. Outliers may be detected by tabulation of the data, plotting, or by analysis of residuals. An explanation should be sought for any questionable data points. Without an explanation, data points should only be discarded with extreme caution. If there is no explanation, the analysis should be performed both with and without the outlier, and the results both analyses by using non-parametric tests, but careful laboratory practices reduce the outliers. 12.2.4.4.2 for A'ornmlit_v. The for small sizes normally distributed. Residuals are the of residuals for each treatment and over all treatments is zero. The Shapiro-Wilk's Test provides a test statistic W, which is compared to values of W expected from a normal distribution.

(n,,,J has at least twice replicates as the treatment with the fewest replicates (n,,,,). Note that higher CI levels are used when the number of snlall, or when the design is unbalanced, because these are the cases in which departures from normality have the greatest effects on t- tests and other parametric comparisons. If data fail the test for normality, even analyses. 12.2.4.4.4 of quantiles of W can be found Shapiro and Wilk (1965), Gill (1978), Conover (1980), that commonly available computer programs or statistical packages are preferred for calculation of W. 12.2.4.4.5 Tests for Homogeneity of Variances. There are a number of tests for equality of variances. Some of these tests are sensitive to departures from normality, which is why a test for normality should be performed first. Bartlett's Test or other Levene's Test or Cochran's Test (Winer, 1971; Snedecor and Cochran, 1989) all have similar power for small, equal sample sizes (n=5) (Conover et al., 1981), and any one of these tests is adequate for the analyses in this section. Many software packages for t- tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) provide at least one of the variances are included in the available statistical software, Hartley's F,, can easily be calculated: F mu = ( larger of sf , si )/( smaller of si , si ) When F,, is large, the hypothesis of equal variances is more likely to be rejected. F,, is a two-tailed test because it does not matter which variance is expected to be larger. Some of equality the above tests for equality of variances is rather low (,about 0.3) when n is small. Equality of variances is rejected if the probability associated or homogeneity of variance are not met, transformations of the data may remedy the problem, so that the data can be parametric procedures, rather than by a nonparametric these analyses is to transform the responses, and satisfy the normality requirement. If the data do not meet the assumption of normality and there are four or more replicates per group, then the nonparametric test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, can be used to analyze the data. If the data meet the assumption of normality, Bartlett's Test or Hartley's F test for equality of is used to test the homogeneity of the homogeneity of variance assumption leads to the use of a modified t test and the degrees of freedom for the test are adjusted. 97 this the proportion surviving is taken as the sine value, the square root of the sine value is calculated, and the angle (in radians) for the square root of the sine value is determined. When the proportion surviving is 0 or I, a special modification of the transformation should be used (Bartlett, (number exposed) 2, Transform each RP to arcsine, as zero Angle sineJm arcsine when RP = where number animals/treatment replicate. arcsine when RP = 1.0. Ang& = 1.5708 r*s-(r&s fur RP = The true population mean (p) and standard (0) are known only after sampling the entire population. In most cases samples are taken randomly from the population, and the s calculated from those samples is only an estimate of CL Student's t-values account for this uncertainty. The degrees of freedom for the test, which are defined as the sample size minus one (n-l), and D. 12.2.4.6.1 When using a t table, it is crucial to determine whether table on be one-sided (one-tailed test) or two-sided (two-tailed test). The null hypothesis (H,) is always that the two values being analyzed are equal. A one-sided alternative hypothesis (H.J is that there is a specified relationship between the two values (e.g., one value is greater than the other) versus a two-sided alternative hypothesis (H,) which is that the two values are simply different (i.e., either 98 larger or smaller). A one-tailed test is used when there is an a priori reason to test for a specific relationship between two means such as the alternative hypothesis that the treatment mortality or tissue residue is greater than the control mortality or tissue residue. In contrast, the two-tailed test is used when the direction of the difference is not important or cannot be assumed before testing. one-tailed is most cases. For the same number of replicates, one-tailed tests are more likely to detect statistically significant differences between treatments (e.g., have a greater power). This is a critical consideration when dealing with a small number of replicates (such as B/treatment). The other alternative for increasing statistical power is to increase the number of replicates, which increases the cost of the test. 12.2.4.6.3 There are cases when a one-tailed test is inappropriate. When no a priori assumption can be made as to how the values vary in relationship to one another, a two- tailed be used. An example hypothesis that the reference sediment total organic carbon (TOC) content is different (greater or lesser) from the control sediment TOC. 12.2.4.6.4 The t-value for a one-tailed probability may be found in a two-tailed table by looking up t under the column for the desired one-tailed probability. For example, the one-tailed t-value for a = 0.05 and df = 20 is 1.725, and is found in a two-tailed table using the column for cc = 0.10. 12.2.4.7 The usual statistical test for independent samples is the two- sample t-test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989). The t-statistic for testing the equality of means x, and xz from two independent n, and n2 replicates and unequal variances is: where st and si are the sample variances of the two groups. Although the equation assumes that the variances of the two groups are unequal, it is equally useful for situations in which the variances of the two groups are equal. This statistic is compared with the Student t distribution with degrees of freedom (df) given by Satterthwaite's (1946) approximation: This formula can result in fractional degrees of freedom, in which case one should round the degree of freedom down to the nearest integer in order to use a t table. Using this 99 approach, the degrees of freedom for this test will be less than the degrees of freedom for a t-test variances. If there are unequal treatments, the t-test with When unnecessary. Nonparametric Tests. Tests such as the t-test, which analyze the original or transformed data, and which rely on the properties of the normal distribution, are referred to as parametric tests. Nonparametric tests, which do not require normally distributed means. or 50th percentile observation when the data are ranked from smallest to largest. In many cases, nonparametric tests can be performed simply converting statistical corresponding parametric tests when the parametric test assumptions are If parametric tests are not appropriate for comparisons because the normality a normal distribution. Thus, using rankits imposes a normal distribution over all the data, although not necessarily within each treatment. Rankits can be obtained by ranking the data, converting the ranks to rankits using the following formula: where z is the normal deviate and N is the total number of observations. Alternatively, rankits may be obtained from and comparisons involving only two treatments (N = 2), there is no need to test assumptions on the rankits or ranks; Analysis Some experiments are set up to compare more than one treatment with a control while others may also be interested in comparing the treatments with one another. The basic design of these experiments is the same as for experiments evaluating pairwise comparisons. After the applicable comparisons are determined, the must be tested for normality to determine if parametric statistics are appropriate and whether the variances of the treatments are equal. normality of the data and equal variances are established, then an analysis of variance (ANOVA) may be performed to address the hypothesis that the treatments including control are equal. If normality or equality of variance are not established then transformations of the data may be appropriate or nonparametric statistics can be used to test for equal means. Tests for normality of the data should be performed on the treatment residuals. A residual is defined as the observed value minus the treatment mean, that is, rik = oi, - (kth treatment mean). Pooling residuals provides an for equality. Currently there is no easy way to test for equality of the treatment means using analysis of variance if the variances are not equal. In a toxicity test with several treatments, one treatment may have 100% mortality in all of its replicates, or the control treatment may have 100% survival in all of its replicates. These responses result in 0 variance for a treatment which results in a rejection of equality of variance in these cases. No transformation will change this outcome. In this case, the replicate responses for the treatment with 0 variance should be removed before testing for equality of variances. Only those treatments that do not have 0 replicate variance should be used in the ANOVA to get an estimate of the within treatment variance. After a variance estimate is obtained, the means of the treatments with 0 variance may be tested evaluated with the Hartley F,, test or Bartlett's test. The option of using nonparametric statistics on the entire set of data is also an alternative. 12.2.4.9.2 If the data are not normally distributed or the variances among data transformation, nonparametric analyses are appropriate. If there are four or more replicates per treatment and the number of replicates per treatment is equal, the data can test with Bonferroni's adjustment. Steel's Many-One Rank test is a nonparametric test for comparing treatments with a control. This test is an alternative to the Dunnett's Procedure, and may be applied to data when the normality assumption has Steel's test requires across treatments to deviations from this 1993a). Wilcoxon's Sum Tests is a nonparameteric test to be used as an alternative to the Steel's test when the number of replicates are not the same within each treatment. A Bonferroni's adjustment of the pairwise error rate for comparison of each treatment versus the control is used to set an upper bound of alpha on the overall error rate. This is in contrast to the Steel's test with a fixed overall error rate for alpha. Thus, Steel's tests is deciding a gradient were acceptable or not acceptable, relative to a such that the probability of making a Type I error in the entire series of comparisons is not greater than the chosen experiment-wise a level of the test. This results in a more conservative test when comparing any particular sample to the control or reference. However, if several samples were taken from the same area and the decision to accept or reject the area was based upon all comparisons with a reference then an experiment- wise error rate be used. When an experiment-wise rate is used, the power to detect real differences between any two means decreases as a function of the number of treatment means being compared to control treatment. 12.2.4.9.4 The recommended procedure for pairwise comparisons a and equal replication is Least mean comparison test should give results similar to the LSD. If the treatments do not contain equal numbers of replicates, the appropriate is with Bonferroni's that recommended for comparisons with the control. 12.2.4.9.5 Dunnett's test has an overall error rate of a, which accounts for the multiple comparisons with the control. Dunnett's procedure a pooled estimate value calculated in an ANOVA. Dunnett's procedure can only be used when the same number of replicate test chambers have been used at each treatment and the control. 12.2.4.9.6 To perform the individual comparisons, calculate the t statistic for each treatment and control combination, as follows: where ii = Mean for each treatment ui = Mean for the control SW = Square root of the within mean square n, = Number of replicates in the control. n, = Number of replicates for treatment \"i\".

Given the assumption of normality for the log,,, of the tolerances, the relationship between the transformed z-score: for example, the probit corresponding to 70% mortality is or =.52.

The mortalities should be corrected with the Chi-square statistic is used to determine if the data fit the Probit model. If many data sets are to be compared to one another, the probit method is not recommended because it may not be appropriate for many of the data sets. This method also is only appropriate for mortality data sets and should not be used for estimating endpoints that are a function of the control response, such as inhibition are pooled obtain procedure for estimating the LC50 and the associated OS 9% confidence interval (Hamilton et al.. 1977).

The procedure was designed for general applicability in the analysis of data from chronic toxicity tests, and the generation of an endpoint from a continuous model that allows a confidence limits for the eudpoint of a single test, and a mean and coefficient of variation for the endpoints response function, are from a random, independent, and representative sample of test data. If the data are not monotonically nonincreasing, they are adjusted by smoothing (averaging). In cases where the responses at the low toxicant concentrations are much higher than in the controls, process may result in a large upward for the test. No assumption is made about the distribution of the data except that the data within a group being resampled are independent and Thus, the the control. 107 12.2.5.7.3 If the assumption of monotonicity of test results is met, the observed response means (Y,) should same concentration If control mean (Y,). response ,at smaller than control mean (Y,), it is used as the response.

In the bootstrap method, the test data Yji is randomly resampled with replacement to produce a new set of data Yji*, that is statistically equivalent to the original data, but which produces a new and slightly different estimate of the ICp (IQ*). This process is repeated at least 80 times and Holtzman, 1988) resulting in multiple \"data\" sets, each with an ICp* estimate. The distribution of the ICp* estimates derived from the sets of resampled data approximates the sampling distribution of the ICp estimate. The standard error of the ICp is estimated by the standard deviation ICp* empirical distribution. For example, if the test data are resampled a minimum of 80 time, the empirical 2.5% and the 97.5% confidence limits and second largest lCp* estimates (Marcus and Holtzman, 1988). intervals calculated by the bootstrap method is variability of the data.

Similar concentrations of a chemical in units of mass of chemical per mass of sediment dry weight often exhibit a range in an organism. solid response of organisms to multiple contaminants in sediment. A toxic unit is the concentration of a chemical divided by an effect concentration. For example, a toxic unit exposure can be calculated by dividing the measured concentration of a chemical in pore water by the water-only LC50 for the same chemical (Ankley et al., 1991a). Toxicity expressed as toxic units may be summed and this may provide information on the toxicity of chemical mixtures (Ankley et to provide either a qualitative reconnaissance of the distribution of sediment contamination or a quantitative statistical comparison of contamination (Burton and Ingersoll, 1994).

For these reasons, it is recommended that trained laboratory personnel conduct of which are used to determine the ability of the laboratory personnel to obtain precise results--these determinations be made test and should be 112 routinely performed as long as whole sediment tests are being conducted; (2) control reference determine if the test results are within prescribed limits; and (3) tests must meet the minimum one with Rhepoxynius abronius 1986). is material. The relative accuracy of the reference can only be by comparing test to control charts. 13.3.1 The sensitivity of sediment will depend in the number of replicates per concentration, the probability levels (alpha and beta) selected, and the type of statistical analysis. For a given level of variability, the sensitivity of the test will increase as varies of the test and the statistical method used for analysis of the data (Section 12). 13.4 Demonstrating Acceptable Laboratory Performance 13.41 It is the responsibility of a laboratory to demonstrate its ability to variation (CV), of the range for each type of test to be used in a laboratory should be determined by performing five or more tests with different batches of test organisms, using the same reference toxicant. at the same concentrations, with the same test conditions (e.g.. the same test duration, type of water, age of test organisms, feeding). and same data analysis methods. This should be done to gain experience for the toxicity tests and a point of reference for future testing. A reference toxicant concentration series provide partial mortalities concentrations chemical (Section 9.14, Table 9.1). 113 The from an outside regardless of whether they are from culture or collected from the tield, must be verified by conducting a test provide the history of the sensitivity of organisms from source culture. For collection location. the water salinity and temperature at the time of collection, and collection site sediment for holding and acclimation purposes. If the supplier has not conducted five reference toxicity tests with the test organism, it is the responsibility of the testing laboratory to conduct these five reference toxicity tests before starting a as outlined in Table 11.1. It is recommended five exposures with sediment be conducted reference from five tests are adequate for establishing the control charts. III this technique, a running plot is maintained for the values (Xi) from successive tests with to determine if they prescribed limits. Control charts as described of results from a series of samples. The mean and upper and lower control are re-calculated with each successive test result. After two years of data collection, or a minimum of 20 data points, the control chart should be maintained using only the 20 most recent 13.J.5 The outliers, which are values falling outside the upper using control charts. W'ith an alpha of 0.05, one in 20 tests would be expected to fall outside of the control limits by chance alone. During a 30 d period, if two reference toxicity tests out of total previous 20 fall control limits, the sediment toxicity tests conducted during the that time which second reference toxicity test failed are suspect, and should and subject to careful review. .A sediment test falls outside the expected rage or if mortality in the control of the reference toxicity test exceeds 111%. All the considered of of the sediment test would depend on the experience and judgement of investigator and the rc@rtory authority. 13-M If value from given organisms and 114 the overall credibility of the test system are suspect (USEPA, 1993a). In this case, the test examined for defects and should of test organisms. 13.4.7 Performance should improve with gradually narrow. However, k2 SD, definition, will be exceeded 5% of the time, regardless of how well a laboratory performs. Highly proficient laboratories narrow control limit may be unfairly penalized if a test which falls just outside the control limits is rejected defacto. For this reason, the width of the control limits should be considered in determining whether or not an outlier is to be rejected. This determination may be made by the regulatory authority the data. 13.4.8 The recommended reference toxicity test consists of a control and five or more concentrations in which the endpoint is an estimate of the toxicant concentration which is lethal to 50% of the test organisms in the time period prescribed by the test. The LC50 is determined been because they are well-tested, well-documented, and are applicable to most types of test data. Many other methods were considered in the selection process. and it is recognized that the methods selected are not the only possible is described by Mearns et al. (1986). Details of this study are described here. Five laboratories participated in the study, including federal and state government laboratories, a contract laboratory, and an academic laboratory. The laboratories were chosen because each had demonstrated experience in laboratory to conduct 10-d sediment tests a total of 7 One control sediment was tested. result in the following measured concentrations: field-collected sediments Sound, WA: Central Basin (Metro Seattle Station A6OOE), inner Sinclair Inlet. and Slip No. 1 in City Waterway, Commencement Bay. 11s 13.5.2.1.2 Amphipods were collected from a depth of 6 m off West Beach, Whidbey Island, WA, and distributed to each participating laboratory. used its own seawater. 13.5.2.1.3 All five laboratories had >'H)% survival in control sediment, and thereby met the performance criteria for the test. Mean survival in control sediment was 96.4%, the CV was 3.7%, and the range was from 92 to l(K)% (Table Of the cadmium- spiked sediments, survival was the least variable in the 4 mg/kg Cd treatment.
