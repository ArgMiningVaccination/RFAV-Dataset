What is the difference between traditional medicine and integrative medicine? What advantages does this medicine for patients? Why choose this type of medicine? According to the World Health Organization, health \"is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not just the absence of disease or infirmity.\" To achieve this goal, integrative medicine put all its attention on the patient and addresses the whole range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental influences that affect the health of the person. At the beginning of the 20th century, the chemical synthesis of medicines and the birth of large pharmaceutical industries left the approach to a more natural medicine in the background to try to cure the diseases of patients.
