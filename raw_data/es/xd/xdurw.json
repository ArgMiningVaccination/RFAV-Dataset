The nation's largest mass shooting had taken place just miles from my home and the images were awful and gut-wrenching. I stood frozen as it felt like the world I knew had just melted around me, and I knew in that moment that something had changed for me personally as well. I knew I had to do something. I knew there was going to be a part for me to help facilitate the healing within my community. As Las Vegas began to wake up, the news showed different images that would become iconic for me as the cowboy boots left to litter the venue and sidewalks. There were lines of people wrapping around city blocks waiting to donate their blood to help, while strangers handed out handmade peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and water bottles to them. There were pallets of water, and delivery after delivery of food showing up to feed first responders and healthcare workers to help the survivors. In the days that followed, there would be 58 handmade crosses rolling into Vegas\" sign would visit and support. Two landscape architects would sit quietly in a caf\u00e9 scrolling out a plan for a place of contemplation and solace, where thousands a garden for healing. Las rookie NHL team, the Vegas Golden Knights, would dedicate their next home game to the first responders of 1 October and declare that \"together, we are Vegas Strong.\" Over the next few weeks, then months, then years, the term \"Vegas Strong\" would continue throughout a community was bound and determined to not let one horrific crime define it. October 1, 2017, wasn't just the day that the nation's largest mass shooting took place on the Vegas strip, but the day Las Vegas went from a being community that now reached far beyond geographical borders. Annually around the year mark, find myself reflecting on the journey the impacted community has been on, as well as my own personal journey, because they have been intertwined from the beginning. This October marks four years. As I reflect, I am still awestruck at the community response and compassion that continue to this day. I am awestruck at the systemic-wide changes within victim/survivor services and the myriad healing resources that have been developed. I am awestruck at the individual healing stories among the survivors and bereaved families. I am awestruck at what the Strong Resiliency Center has been able to become. Healing linear and it doesn't happen in a vacuum. We have setbacks along the way and many of them come from circumstances outside of one's control. Even taking the setbacks and various trials along the way, I am comforted to report that what I truly see looking back at the four-year mark is healing. My story with staffing a legal assistance table as an attorney with Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada at the Family Assistance Center. I soon found myself with the Executive Director of Legal Aid Center, Barbara Buckley, in a meeting with federal consultants to discuss setting up what they called a \"resiliency center.\" We walked out of that meeting in complete silence, our minds racing at the possibilities that such a place could offer the impacted community but also in perpetuity for subsequent mass casualty incident or other victims of violence. This was our opportunity to make sure something good came out of this horrific crime. We began by staffing a legal team at newly Center Family Assistance Center. Soon, Clark County asked Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada to take over operations and management of the VSRC as a more nimble nonprofit. We eventually with ample for our community partners and to work alongside us to develop community resource for healing. We began looking into victim services for the state of Nevada and whether or not there where changes that could be made to facilitate healing for all victims. Two legislative sessions have come and gone and, during each one, we have been able to consult and on successful measures that victim/survivor services throughout Nevada. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we were a beacon in the storm for thousands now dealing with an extra layer of trauma. Just this past year, we were awarded an extra grant to hire a victim advocate to begin providing services to any victim of a violent crime in Nevada based on the service model of the VSRC. It goes without saying that we would have never reached these important benchmarks without the like-minded efforts by our partners, community partners, and dedicated individuals throughout the survivor and bereaved family community. We have been honored to take part in a bi-monthly forum designed for resiliency center directors by the National Mass Violence Victimization Research Center. These efforts have led to additional healing in all communities that have been devastated by mass violence, as we have shared our experiences and learned from other communities all across the nation to foster our collective healing. To this day, all different types of professionals and businesses offer valuable resources or the development of resources to support the efforts of the VSRC. Behavioral health providers have increased their trauma resources. Survivors have been trained to offer peer support to other survivors. Bereaved family members support one another through special social media connections they have established. Everywhere I turn, I see others rising to create, innovate, exceed, and strive in order to foster healing in themselves and in others. In a way, four years after looks very much like it did in those early days of a community coming together. It is the accumulation of all the efforts, big and small, that has truly led us down a path of healing four years in the making. I can honestly say that I am a better person, the community around me is more unified, victim/survivor services have improved, and healing has truly taken place. There is no finish line in this challenging and painful journey, yet I am confident that we will continue to heal, as we continue to foster healing in others. Warning: This anniversary of the horrific mass shooting that occurred in Las Vegas at a concert. The shooting lasted ten minutes. Shortly thereafter, 58 people were dead, hundreds more were injured. This event remains the largest mass shooting in US history. A song, \"Four Years After,\" was recently written, recorded, and released in honor of all of those affected by the atrocity. The recording features the most extraordinary talent from Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and London. The song was produced by the legendary Alan Parsons and sung by America's Got Talent winner Michael Grimm. \"Four Years After\" can be found at most music digital outlets including iTunes and Spotify. [Click here for additional information and lyrics.](https://www.mstreet.rocks/four-years-after) Just as there were thousands of concert attendees, concert staff, responders, medical visitors, and who observed the aftermath firsthand or from a distance, there are as many unique stories of how that night left its mark and its memory. In our community and across the miles, we have witnessed not only the pain but also the compassion of those who offer hope and the healing journeys of those who now call themselves members of the Route 91 family. The LV Community Healing Garden is a place where many people have found a space for part of that journey. A survivor expressed that she has been going to the garden since its beginning. Initially, she would find herself overwhelmed with grief, but she now finds it to be a place to reflect and feel love, often connecting with others there who are on the same challenging journey. Each tree at the garden has a picture of the \"angel\" it represents and honors. Many heartfelt items are left at the garden in remembrance. There is a bench placed at the garden that says it all: Forever Family Route 91. The Healing Garden has become just that, a beautiful garden, and a place for each one who visits to heal in their own way. One survivor offers these words: \"When you go through trauma and hard times, it often becomes difficult to see past the pain. Healing from trauma is tough. Healing from trauma isn't . . . there is no shortcut for We will never be able to forget that horrific night four years ago, but we can learn to live with it. Don't let the memories slow you down. There is hope\u2014for all of us. Fight because the world needs you. needs by adversity and struggle. It needs you, who have been through so much but still manage to remain kind and compassionate. When everything seems dark, choose to be the light.\" There are a number of events and initiatives to honor and heal during the fourth remembrance of the Route 91 tragedy of October 1, 2017, available both in-person and online.

Based what we violence and knew that the impact would extend far beyond those who were direct victims and survivors. We knew that it is terrifying to be in a large crowd with everyone running frantically trying to escape, with some people being trampled in the process. We knew that seeing people around you who were killed or injured is traumatic, as is the \"survivors' guilt\" that comes from having survived the shooting when others did not. We also suspected that the concertgoers would be from many parts of the nation, not just Las Vegas, and that this would pose many challenges for victim assistance efforts. I recall my personal sense of dismay and anger at yet another senseless act of mass violence that I knew would irrevocably countless lives of victims and survivors. And I recollect that my staff and I felt a small solace because we personally wonderful victim advocates many across our nation, who we knew would be called upon to respond to this horrendous mass casualty crime, and who would so and I also recall October 1, 2017, special of purpose. On September 28, 2017, we were notified by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), that they had selected our team at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to establish the National Mass Violence Victimization Resource Center (NMVVRC) with a start date of October 1, 2017. The mission of the NMVVRC was, and is, to community research, planning, training, technology, and collaboration. We were unable to start work on the NMVVRC until paperwork between OVC and MUSC was completed, but the Las Vegas mass shooting highlighted the importance of our mission, as well as the need for us to get underway as quickly as possible. Our center is committed in by forum comprised of mass violence victim mental health professionals, including Elynne Greene, the Victim Services and Human Trafficking Manager for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Greene was not only one of the countless dedicated first responders who helped out in the aftermath of October 1, but she also brings decades of experience as a compassionate and committed victim advocate. It is sad, yet heartening, to say that with every new mass casualty crime in America, we are able to document \"lessons that to these important efforts. VSRC leaders are an integral part of our Forum, where participants from a mass violence meet monthly to share their personal and professional the impact of mass violence on victims, forum has contributed to effective strategies that best identify and meet The NMVVRC has also created a critical partnership victims, survivors, and surviving family members of the Las Vegas mass shooting. We know that those who have been affected by mass violence are the only ones who have a real understanding of what experiencing this type of event is like, so the purpose of this survey is to get information about their opinions and experiences. The survey is anonymous and asks about how they were affected by the mass shooting, their experiences with services they were offered, and how well agencies are doing in providing services victims want and need. Victims also can make recommendations about how to improve services. Survey results will provide valuable information to our center, the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center, and to the USDOJ Office for Victims of Crime about what mass violence victims' needs are and how to improve services. When the NMVVRC opened four years ago, our vision was simple: \"Victims and survivors of mass violence must have access to first-rate, evidence-based information, and the victims' needs members during the past four years since the shooting, we believe that the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center and the entire community of Las Vegas share that vision. We know that there is a long road ahead, but we must all keep our vision in sharp focus and our commitment strong. It is completely natural to feel increased anxiety and replay the memories of a traumatic experience in your head as its anniversary approaches. There are a number of coping strategies that may help you during this time, however. Reach out to others, do not isolate yourself, talk with people who care about you, and if you have not already done so, find a trauma-informed counselor who can help positive ones. Bridge Counseling's Merlelynn M.S., MFT, shares these and other strategies for survivors of Route 91 in this video. [Click here to find other trauma coping tips that may help you if you are experiencing fear, anxiety, guilt, flashbacks, or other symptoms related to 1 October.](https://vegasstrongrc.wpengine.com/trauma-coping-tips/) Para aquellos impactados por el Festival Route 91 Harvest, el 1 de octubre del 2017 es un d\u00eda que por siempre va a tener un significado especial. Asistentes me dicen que estaban disfrutando mucho a lo largo del fin de semana del festival, hasta el momento en que se transform\u00f3 en una experiencia que les arruin\u00f3 su vida. Se acerca el cuarto a\u00f1o desde ese fin de semana de diversi\u00f3n y amistad que se convirti\u00f3 en una noche de vidas perdidas, heridos y personas que por siempre van a estar afectadas. Sin embargo, la violencia que sucedi\u00f3 esa noche no tiene que evitar que los afectados contin\u00faen una vida llena de logros y felicidad. Al acercarse el 1 de octubre, aquellos impactados por la violencia en el Festival Harvest pueden experimentar una variedad de s\u00edntomas f\u00edsicos y emocionales as\u00ed como temor e incertidumbre. Estas emociones dolorosas pueden empezar semanas antes de la fecha anual. Si tu o alguien que conoces fueron impactados por la violencia masiva en el Ruta 91, tengan en mente que para muchas personas, al acercarse la conmemoraci\u00f3n va a traer recuerdos dolorosos. La fecha anual del evento traum\u00e1tico puede reactivar pensamientos y sentimientos del mismo incidente. Muchos pueden sentir ansiedad, estr\u00e9s, duelo, tristeza, pesadillas, frustraci\u00f3n, e ira. Otros pueden experimentar insomnio o exceso de sue\u00f1o. Algunos pueden solo sentirse diferente sin hacer una conexi\u00f3n directa con la fecha del trauma. Si est\u00e1s experimentando estos s\u00edntomas, te queremos recordar que no est\u00e1s solo. Algunos terapeutas se refieren a la reactivaci\u00f3n autom\u00e1tica de estos sentimientos como el \"Efecto Aniversario.\" A pesar de que el Efecto Aniversario es una respuesta completamente normal, muchos no est\u00e1n al tanto de que estas emociones se activan por la cercan\u00eda de la fecha de conmemoraci\u00f3n del incidente y se pueden sentir desanimados, como si estuviera retrocediendo en su camino de sanaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, experimentar estas emociones que se acercan con estos tiempos puede ser parte del curso normal de sanaci\u00f3n y un indicador de los rastros del trauma que un terapeuta nos puede ayudar a procesar. Todos tienen experiencias con el aniversario de un trauma muy personales. Eso es normal. Lo importante es encontrar la manera de procesar el trauma que nos ayuda a sanar. Si encuentras que se te dificulta hacer las cosas que disfrutabas, puede ser un indicador de sentimiento de culpa por haber sobrevivido cuando otros no lo hicieron. Este es un tipo de duelo que un consejero le puede ayudar a procesar. Ya sea que te encuentres en un punto de tu camino a la sanaci\u00f3n en el que quieras conmemorar el 1 de octubre, o que necesites regresar a aplicar estrategias de afrontamiento, o ambos, existen actividades que puedes hacer durantes las semanas previas al 1 de octubre para fomentar tu sanaci\u00f3n. Se amable contigo mismo. Establece un tiempo para ti mismo en el que puedas reflexionar sin ser apresurado. Llevar un diario u otra forma de expresi\u00f3n creativa puede ser muy ben\u00e9fica. Tus sentimientos son v\u00e1lidos y es por tu propio bienestar que los proceses de una forma segura. Cuida de tu salud mental. Agenda una o dos sesiones extra de terapia. Si ha pasado un tiempo considerable desde tu \u00faltima cita de terapia, considera agendar una sesi\u00f3n de terapia y acude. Nunca es demasiado tarde para unirse a un grupo de apoyo, conectar con [un mentor de apoyo mutuo](https://vegasstrongrc.wpengine.com/heart/), o iniciar terapia por primera vez con un proveedor calificado. Si te encuentras dependiendo en conductas adictivas, no est\u00e1s solo y puedes encontrar juntas en l\u00ednea o en persona sobre el camino a la recuperaci\u00f3n de los 12 Pasos. Participa en actividades que disfrutes. Si es estar solo lo que disfrutas, planea un tiempo para ti solo. Para algunas personas estar en la naturaleza es algo que les ayuda. Pasar tiempo caminando, rezando, meditando y en ocasiones \u00fanicamente estar al aire libre nos da a nuestro cerebro un espacio seguro para procesar nuestras emociones. Si disfrutas de la compa\u00f1\u00eda de otros, planea eso. Pasar tiempo con amigos y familiares puede ser sanador incluso si no hablan sobre el trauma mientras est\u00e1n juntos. \u00bfDisfrutas de cantar? \u00bfBailar?\u00bfReir? Planea actividades en las que hagas esto. Paga con la misma moneda. Algunas personas realizan actos de caridad al azar como una forma de procesar su duelo y honrar a aquellos que fallecieron esa noche. Pueden realizar actos de caridad de forma an\u00f3nima, o en nombre de alguien que ya falleci\u00f3. Ya sea pagando por la comida de un extra\u00f1o o donando a una organizaci\u00f3n sin fines de lucro, el acto de dar a alguien m\u00e1s nos ayuda a recordar que hay amabilidad y bien en el mundo. Si has crecido en tu proceso de sanaci\u00f3n y te gustar\u00eda ayudar a otros con su proceso, considera [convertirte en un mentor de apoyo mutuo](https://vegasstrongrc.wpengine.com/heartpeer/). Se creativo. Algunos sobrevivientes encuentran terap\u00e9utico el pintar rocas con palabras que son significativas para ellos y luego dejarlas en el Las Vegas Healing Garden o dejarlas en otras ubicaciones como s\u00edmbolo de aliento para otros. Algunas personas encuentran beneficioso escribir palabras que representen los sentimientos con los que est\u00e1n lidiando y luego deshacerse de ellas en una forma simb\u00f3lica. Considera tu fe. Rezar, asistir a un servicio religioso, prender una veladora, meditar. Todo eso puede ayudarnos a cuidar de nuestra alma y esp\u00edritu. Recuerda a otros. Llama a otros que sabes fueron impactados por el Ruta 91. Ofrece el reunirse de manera virtual o, si es posible, en persona en uno de los eventos de conmemoraci\u00f3n. Sabiendo que no se est\u00e1 solo en el proceso de sanaci\u00f3n es una forma de sanar.
