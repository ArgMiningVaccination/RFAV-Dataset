A total of 917 surveys were carried out among household heads in three districts of the province (Caller\u00eda, Manantay and Yarinacocha), in which the proportion of CAM use was calculated and the relationship with sociodemographic variables (age, sex, educational level, marital status, occupation and income) was analyzed. From the total, 179 respondents (19.5%) mentioned that they used CAM in the last 12 months. A statistically significant relationship was found between the use of CAM therapies and educational level (p < 0.001), respondent's 0.001) and monthly income (p < 0.001). Future research will define the Health Organization defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as the set of health care practices, which are not part of the country's tradition (traditional medicine) and are not fully integrated and articulated with the health system 11.

Integrative Medicine population varies according to the place studied. In Latin America, despite the acceptance of these therapies and the cultural factors linked to them, there are only estimates of their use, which indicate that approximately 7 out of 10 Latino patients resort to non-conventional therapies, such as the use of medicinal plants for their health care 33.

In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of CAM therapies and their associated sociodemographic factors in the province of Coronel Portillo during 2013. Motivation for the study: In Peru, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been barely studied, considering that Peru is a multicultural country where these practices are rooted in society and are used on a daily basis, in parallel to the conventional health system. Main findings: In the Peruvian Amazon, province of Coronel Portillo (Ucayali), 917 people were surveyed, and 19.5% of CAM use was found. Implications: These results support the integration of these therapies into the national health system. THE STUDY Design and population Analytical cross-sectional study conducted districts: Caller\u00eda, Manantay and Yarinacocha, in the province of Coronel Portillo in Ucayali. People aged 18 or older, domiciled in the 3 districts, were included. The participation of one member per family (head of household or whoever was acting as head of household at the time of the survey) was considered. People who did not wish to participate in the study, who could not read or write, or who had problems understanding the survey questions were excluded. Simple random sampling was carried out, with distribution proportional to the study population and applied to all the dwellings in the selected blocks. A total of 3,394 blocks considered, comprising Manantay usage ratio 50%; a 95% confidence level and 5% accuracy. Additionally, a 10% non-response rate was considered and of 840 was obtained (395 surveys in Caller\u00eda, 252 in Yarinacocha 193 Manantay). Epidat 3.1 was used to select the dwellings to be surveyed. Study variables The use of CAM therapies in the last 12 months was considered a dependent variable, defined as the affirmative answer to the question: Have you received any complementary and alternative medicine therapy in the last 12 months? In those who answered yes, the use of CAM therapies was characterized as follows: type of therapy used, institution providing the service and whether it was made known to the treating physician. Age, sex, marital and income were evaluated as possible factors associated with the use of CAM therapies. Procedure and data collection The instrument used consisted data collection sheet of 24 multiple-choice questions, divided in two sections: where information was collected on possible socio-epidemiological factors associated with the use of CAM; and aspects related to the use of CAM in the population (Supplementary material), where the use of these therapies is evaluated. The use of 15 different therapies was studied: acupuncture, medicine, homeopathy, neural magnetic therapy, and \"others\". Therapies not available in the list were included as \"others\". The selection of these therapies was made based on previous studies 1010. Santiv\u00e1\u00f1ez R, Yagui, M. Per\u00fa: Medicina Alternativa y Medicina Complementaria.

The research group trained external surveyors in basic CAM therapy topics and application of the instrument. Expert judgment and pilot tests were conducted prior to study to improve understanding and the timing of instrument application. The research group directly supervised the field work. Data analysis Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were used to show the distribution of study variables in the people included in the research. Later, a bivariate analysis was performed to corroborate the presence of statistical association between each of the possible associated factors and the use of CAM, by using the Chi-square test. These tests were carried out using STATA 13 \u00ae (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Ethical aspects This research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Salud. Due to its nature, this was a low-risk study for participants, who were asked for informed consent before they were included.

It was found that 179 respondents (19.5%) had used CAM in the last 12 months, of which 36 (20.1%) reported that they used these treating that they were using CAM therapies. It was determined that 68.7% of the people who used CAM refer that they went to private establishments (independent), while 20.7% went to the Seguro Social de (EsSalud). percentage went to religious organizations others (3.5%).

Distribution and medicine therapies used in 3 districts of the province of Coronel Portillo (Ucayali) in 2013. In the bivariate analysis, a statistically significant relationship was found between the use of CAM therapies and educational attainment (p < 0.001), associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine in 3 districts of the province of Coronel Portillo (Ucayali) in 2013. DISCUSSION The frequency of CAM therapies use was found to be 19.5%, phytotherapy or use of medicinal plants was the most used. These results are consistent with the findings of Mej\u00eda G\u00e1lvez et al. in a study of outpatients in Metropolitan Lima, where phytotherapy was used by 29.6%66.

Peltzer K, Pengpid S. Prevalence and Determinants Alternative Medicine Provider Use among Kamaruddin MA, et al. Utilization of and Alternative Medicine Multiethnic not use probabilistic samples for the selection of the people surveyed, so this research allows us to establish conclusions that can be very similar to what happens in the area of the population studied. Within the limitations of this study, it should be mentioned that the use of data collection instruments such as data collection sheets implies the inherent probability of information bias and memory bias by the respondents. On the other hand, not considering the use of complex sampling alters the final estimates, and the age of the data may mean that these findings are no longer applicable today. However, the results of this study are relevant because of the lack of information on the use of CAM in the Amazon population. Future studies should consider other whether or not the person providing the information was the head of the family were not studied in depth; therefore, it is recommended that further research add these aspects to the data collection instruments. In conclusion, almost a fifth of the studied sample used and economic income turned out to be factors associated to the use of these therapies. This research provides relevant information about the situation of CAM use by the Amazonian population, in its socio-cultural context and socioeconomic dynamics.
