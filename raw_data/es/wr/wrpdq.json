PY - 2023 Y1 - 2023 N2 - The use of natural zeolite clinoptilolite to reduce the leaching rate of potentially such as Cd, in from mine tailings was studied. Soil from the surroundings of the mine El Bote in Zacatecas, Mexico, was analyzed, and the zeolite were carried out and the effect of the pH of the carrier solutions was studied. of 5.03 concentration of Cd and Mn was reduced when zeolite was present in the column and the ammonium-modified zeolite ammonia a 28 to 68%. The first-order model best fits the experimental data, the rate is by concentration the toxic elements in soil from mine tailings.
