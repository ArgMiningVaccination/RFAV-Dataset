When the Ida and Pingala nadis are unblocked and balanced, they spiral around the Sushumna Naida like the double helix of our DNA, crossing each other at each chakra. The junctions where the Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna nadis meet along the spinal column correspond to the 7 major chakras in our body.

It is important to remember that our bodies are simply vehicles of our real soul, or true self. Just as one learns to take care of a vehicle through an \"owner's manual\" or blueprint, we need to know how to take care of all our bodies through our very own blueprint. At the core of this manual is an understanding of how to balance the energy centres - the 7 chakras - of our bodies. Yoga has already provided us with an abundance of tools and methods which are centred on chakra to to the wheel-like energy centres in our body. While there are many different energy channels and centres, there are 7 major energy centres while can be found from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. Each of these 7 chakras correspond to an aspect of our physical body (nerves, major organs), mental body, emotional states, and consciousness essential for our lives. Together, these 7 chakras provide us a basis for wholeness and growth. Because these 7 major chakras are crucial for health and wellbeing, it is important that they are kept opened, balanced and unblocked.

Sabiendo controlar por medio de la meditaci\u00f3n estos siete Chakras, cambiaremos nuestras vidas, porque todo nuestro ser se alinea cuando alineamos los Chakras, todo empieza a funcionar bien, todo nos sale bien. Nos quisieron vender toda clase de qu\u00edmica para curarnos de enfermedades cuando la naturaleza nos da plantas y minerales para que podamos vivir una vida plena sin enfermedades y la alineaci\u00f3n de lo Chakras para que todo funcione correctamente y en armon\u00eda, y no sola nuestra salud, sino que tambi\u00e9n y fundamentalmente nuestras emociones, salud sexual y espiritual. Trabajando la alineaci\u00f3n de los Chakras entraremos en un estado espiritual mas elevado lo cual obtendremos mucha energ\u00eda positiva porque nuestra vibraci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 diferente y la gente capta esa vibraci\u00f3n y se siente c\u00f3modas con nosotros porque estando a su lado se sentir\u00e1n bien y feliz. Cuando llegamos a un nivel espiritual mas elevado empezamos a sentir mas amor por el mundo, mas amor por la humanidad y eso genera una gran alegr\u00eda en nosotros porque nos empezamos a conectar con el universo. Seguro que esto lleva pr\u00e1ctica y en el camino encontraremos muchas dudas, pero esas dudas nos lleva a una mayor investigaci\u00f3n y por consecuencia mas aprendizaje de cosas positivas que nos llenar\u00e1n de conocimiento y paz. La ciencia est\u00e1 muy lejos de poder comprender todo este conocimiento esot\u00e9rico, saben que existe, no lo niegan, pero no existe una tecnolog\u00eda por ahora que pueda \"medir\" estas energ\u00edas. Mucho dinero se gasta para investigaciones externas cuando todo el conocimiento esta dentro nuestro. Somos nosotros los \u00fanicos que podemos curarnos a nosotros mismos, todo est\u00e1 dentro nuestro. Somos un destello de la gran luz de Dios y estamos capacitados para lograr lo que queremos. Pero las grandes corporaciones necesitan tenernos esclavos e ignorantes para su beneficio. Por suerte, estamos cambiando y a medida que generemos un cambio en nosotros, debemos compartir el conocimiento a los dem\u00e1s, para nuestro bien y el bien de ellos. La alineaci\u00f3n de los Chakras nos permitir\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n avanzar hacia otro estado de conciencia lo cual se gener\u00e1 un bienestar interior que luego no queremos dejar. Creemos nosotros que en el trabajo de los Chakras y el \u00c1rbol de la Vida se encuentra toda la plenitud para que nuestra vida sea la deseada. (Tambi\u00e9n puedes entrar a nuestra secci\u00f3n sobre Kabala y el \u00c1rbol de la vida). Hay que entender tambi\u00e9n que al alcanzar un nivel superior de conciencia, conlleva a una armon\u00eda en la cual entendemos otra realidad, pero nosotros aconsejamos no \"viajarse\" tanto, porque eso perjudica un poco (si lo hacemos a un extremo) nuestra vida social. Siempre debemos caminar entre los cuadros negros y blancos, en el medio, no irnos a los extremos porque eso tampoco es bueno. Sobre todas las cosas, necesitamos un equilibrio.
