Students should know that some questions are outside the realm of science because they deal with phenomena that are not scientifically testable. (2) Scientific hypotheses are tentative and testabl e statements that must be capable of being supported or not supported by observational evidence. Hypotheses of durable explanatory power that have been tested over a wide variety of conditions become theories.

A trav\u00e9s de la inclusi\u00f3n de la estad\u00edstica, la probabilidad y las finanzas, y enfoc\u00e1ndose al mismo tiempo en el pensamiento computacional, en el dominio matem\u00e1tico y en una s\u00f3lida comprensi\u00f3n, Texas ser\u00e1 el l\u00edder en la educaci\u00f3n de las matem\u00e1ticas y preparar\u00e1 a todos sus estudiantes para los retos que enfrentar\u00e1n en el siglo XXI.

La ubicaci\u00f3n de los est\u00e1ndares de procesos al principio de los conocimientos y destrezas de cada grado y curso es intencional. Los est\u00e1ndares de procesos entrelazan los otros conocimientos y destrezas para que los estudiantes puedan tener \u00e9xito al resolver problemas y puedan utilizar las matem\u00e1ticas eficiente y eficazmente en la vida diaria. Los est\u00e1ndares de procesos est\u00e1n integrados en cada grado y en cada curso. Cuando sea posible, los estudiantes aplicar\u00e1n las matem\u00e1ticas a los problemas que surgen en la vida diaria, la sociedad y el trabajo. Los estudiantes utilizar\u00e1n un modelo de resoluci\u00f3n de problemas que incorpora el an\u00e1lisis de informaci\u00f3n dada, la formulaci\u00f3n de un plan o estrategia, la determinaci\u00f3n de una soluci\u00f3n, la justificaci\u00f3n de la soluci\u00f3n y la evaluaci\u00f3n del proceso de resoluci\u00f3n de problemas, as\u00ed como lo razonable de la soluci\u00f3n. Los estu diantes seleccionar\u00e1n herramientas apropiadas, tales como objetos reales, manipulativos, algo ritmos, papel y l\u00e1piz, adem\u00e1s de tecnolog\u00eda y t\u00e9cnicas, tales como el c\u00e1lculo mental, la estimaci\u00f3n, el sentido num\u00e9rico y la generalizaci\u00f3n y abstracci\u00f3n, para resolver problemas.

Quinto grado, adoptado en el 2012. (a) Introducci\u00f3n (1) El deseo de alcanzar una excelencia educativa es la fuerza que impulsa al curr\u00edculo Conocimientos y Destrezas Esenciales de Texas para matem\u00e1ticas, el cual est\u00e1 guiado por los est\u00e1ndares de preparaci\u00f3n para la univer sidad o para una carrera t\u00e9cnica o vocacional. A trav\u00e9s de la inclusi\u00f3n de la estad\u00edstica, la probabilidad y las finanzas, y enfoc\u00e1ndose al mismo tiempo en el pensamiento computacional, en el dominio matem\u00e1tico y en una Proclamation 2014 Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills 207 s\u00f3lida comprensi\u00f3n, Texas ser\u00e1 el l\u00edder en la educaci\u00f3n de las matem\u00e1ticas y preparar\u00e1 a todos sus estudiantes para los retos que enfrentar\u00e1n en el siglo XXI. (2) Los est\u00e1ndares de procesos describen lo s m\u00e9todos en los cuales se espera que los estudiantes hagan conexiones con el contenido. La ubicaci\u00f3n de los est\u00e1ndares de procesos al principio de los conocimientos y destrezas de cada grado y curso es intencional. Los est\u00e1ndares de procesos entrelazan los otros conocimientos y destrezas para que los estudiantes puedan tener \u00e9xito al resolver problemas y puedan utilizar las matem\u00e1ticas eficiente y eficazmente en la vida diaria. Los est\u00e1ndares de procesos est\u00e1n integrados en cada grado y en cada curso. Cuando sea posible, los estudiantes aplicar\u00e1n las matem\u00e1ticas a los problemas que surgen en la vida diaria, la sociedad y el trabajo. Los estudiantes utilizar\u00e1n un modelo de resoluci\u00f3n de problemas que incorpora el an\u00e1lisis de informaci\u00f3n dada, la formulaci\u00f3n de un plan o estrategia, la determinaci\u00f3n de una soluci\u00f3n, la justificaci\u00f3n de la soluci\u00f3n y la evaluaci\u00f3n del proceso de resoluci\u00f3n de problemas, as\u00ed como lo razonable de la soluci\u00f3n. Los estu diantes seleccionar\u00e1n herramientas apropiadas, tales como objetos reales, manipulativos, algo ritmos, papel y l\u00e1piz, adem\u00e1s de tecnolog\u00eda y t\u00e9cnicas, tales como el c\u00e1lculo mental, la estimaci\u00f3n, el sentido num\u00e9rico y la generalizaci\u00f3n y abstracci\u00f3n, para resolver problemas. Los estudiantes comunicar\u00e1n eficazmente ideas matem\u00e1ticas y su razonamiento, adem\u00e1s de las implicaciones de \u00e9stos utilizando m\u00faltiples representaciones, tales co mo s\u00edmbolos, diagramas, gr\u00e1ficas, programas de computadora y el lenguaje com\u00fan. Los estudiantes utilizar\u00e1n relaciones matem\u00e1ticas para generar soluciones y hacer conexiones, as\u00ed como predicciones. Los estudiantes analizar\u00e1n relaciones matem\u00e1ticas para c onectar y comunicar ideas matem\u00e1ticas. Los estudiantes mostrar\u00e1n, explicar\u00e1n o justif icar\u00e1n ideas y razonamientos matem\u00e1ticos utilizando lenguaje matem\u00e1tico preciso en forma verbal o escrita. (3) Para que los estudiantes lleguen a dominar las matem\u00e1ticas, tendr\u00e1n que desarrollar un s\u00f3lido sentido num\u00e9rico. El reporte del National Research Council, \"Adding It Up,\" define el dominio de los procedimientos como \"la destreza de poder realizar procedimientos de manera flexible, precisa, eficiente y apropiada\". Mientras los estudiantes desarrollan el dominio de los procedimientos, tambi\u00e9n tienen que reconocer que la verdadera resoluci\u00f3n de problemas puede tomar tiempo, esfuerzo y pe rseverancia. Se espera que los estudiantes en quinto grado realicen su trabajo sin el uso de calculadoras. (4) Las \u00e1reas de enfoque principal en quinto grado incluyen resolver problemas que involucran las cuatro operaciones b\u00e1sicas con n\u00fameros racionales positivos, determinar y generar f\u00f3rmulas y soluciones a expresiones, as\u00ed como extender la medici\u00f3n al \u00e1rea y al volumen. Estas \u00e1reas de enfoque est\u00e1n apoyadas en las \u00e1reas de las matem\u00e1ticas de n\u00fameros y operaciones, razonamiento algebraico, geometr\u00eda y medici\u00f3n, as\u00ed como en el an\u00e1lisis de datos. En los grados de tercero a quinto, el conjunto de n\u00fameros se limita a n\u00fameros racionales positivos. En n\u00fameros y operaciones, los estudiantes aplicar\u00e1n el valor de posici\u00f3n e identificar\u00e1n las relaciones de las pa rtes respecto al entero y su equivalencia. En razonamiento algebraico, los estudiantes representar\u00e1n y resolver\u00e1n problemas con expresiones y ecuaciones, establecer\u00e1n las bases de las funciones utilizando patrones, identificar\u00e1n n\u00fameros primos y compuestos, y usar\u00e1n el orden de las operaciones. En geometr\u00eda y medici\u00f3n, los estudiantes clasific ar\u00e1n figuras de dos dimensiones, conectar\u00e1n atributos geom\u00e9tricos a las medidas de figuras de tres dimensiones, utilizar\u00e1n unidades de medici\u00f3n y representar\u00e1n ubicaciones utilizando un plano de coordenadas. En an\u00e1lisis de datos, los estudiantes representar\u00e1n e interpretar\u00e1n datos. Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Proclamation 2014 208 (5) Los enunciados que contienen las palabras \"incluyendo\" o \"que incluyan\" se refieren a destrezas que deben dominarse, mientras que los que contienen las frases \"como\", \"tal(es) como\" o \"por ejemplo\" se presentan como opciones posibles.
