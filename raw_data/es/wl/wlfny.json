Scientists say that carbon dioxide (CO2) is responsible for all kinds of environmental damage, and in the United States, the largest source of CO2 emissions comes from the generation of electricity. If we want to make an impact, we should make changes where it matters most. Most people would like to be more eco-friendly, but they don't follow through because \"green technologies are In reality, though, the cost difference is usually minimal, and green technologies can actually help you save money by using less electricity.

It's true that energy saving light bulbs are more expensive than regular light bulbs, but they compensate for the price with a longer life span (which also means fewer trips to the supermarket to buy new ones).
