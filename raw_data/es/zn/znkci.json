Therefore, it is necessary to replace or integrate high risk chemicals with safer tools for human health and environment. Consequently, research on the selection, evaluation, characterization, and use of biocontrol agents (BCAs) has consistently increased in the last decades. BCA formulates, particularly in some countries, are still scarce in coping with the growing demand for their use in sustainable agricultural management. To foster development and utilization of new effective bioformulates, there is a need to optimize BCA activity, to share knowledge on their formulation processes and to simplify the registration procedures. Studies based on new molecular tools can significantly contribute to achieve such objectives. The present review provides the state of the art on biocontrol of fungal plant diseases with special emphasis on (i) features of the most studied BCAs; (ii) key strategies to optimize selection and use of BCAs (iii); mechanisms of action of the main BCAs; (iv) molecular tools and metagenomic studies in the selection and use of BCAs; (v) main issues and constraints in the registration and commercialization of BCAs, and (vi) perspectives in the biocontrol of fungal plant diseases.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-06-25", "cleaned_text": "spp. also been elucidated, although research on this topic is still ongoing with the aim to discover/elucidate better new mechanisms and biocontrol activity and way to enhance BCA effectiveness and to foster their use in agriculture is their integration/alternance with other control tools, including combination of BCAs the complex interactions of BCAs with host plant, pathogens and other microorganisms, and allow drawing up of the criteria for the selection and use of new BCAs. Furthermore, molecular tools are being used for the detection and monitoring of BCAs on plant surfaces and in the environment, thus providing information on the persistence of these agents over time and contributing to collection of useful data can play a key role in the plant diseases. of some fungal diseases in susceptible host plant is considerably mitigated specific soil affected by microbial abundance, within the community [ [16](#B16-horticulturae-08-00577), [17](#B17-horticulturae-08-00577)]. For many years, suppressive soils from natural and agricultural environments have represented an important source in which to select microorganisms active the [20](#B20-horticulturae-08-00577)]. indigenous microbes or by introducing selected antagonists. The efficacy of fungal and bacterial species in of soil borne fungal pathogens has been extensively studied over the years, both in in vitro and in vivo systems. Among the fungi, Trichoderma pathogens affecting the root system and the collar of agricultural crops. The main Trichoderma species effective in [ diseases. Their main mechanisms of actions are indirect since they are based on the induction of resistance in the host plant [ [28](#B28-horticulturae-08-00577)] and on improving the nutritional status of the plant [ [29](#B29-horticulturae-08-00577)]. Several [ However, ability is correlated Bacterial spp. have been studied for over 40 years, and many of them are currently known and characterised for their ability to reduce the root system and Streptomyces and Burkholderia spp., for which efficacy and mode of action in the soil ecosystem have been rhizosphere between roots and bacteria capable of the shown by Mousa and Palmieri et al.

This is fundamentally due to both (i) inadequate colonization of hosts by useful microorganisms, and (ii) their effect BCAs, commonly microbial consortia, consisting of two more strains, have been developed [ [52](#B52-horticulturae-08-00577)]. Recently, the design of microbial consortia is a major trend in biotechnology applied to the management of soil-borne diseases, and microbial consisting of separate application of prokaryotes [ [54](#B54-horticulturae-08-00577), [55](#B55-horticulturae-08-00577)] or fungi [ [56](#B56-horticulturae-08-00577)] or use of a mix of fungi and bacteria [ [57](#B57-horticulturae-08-00577), [58](#B58-horticulturae-08-00577), [59](#B59-horticulturae-08-00577)] are already microorganisms has be effective in biocontrol experiments [ [60](#B60-horticulturae-08-00577), [61](#B61-horticulturae-08-00577)]. It is likely that the enhanced antagonistic activity is due to the combination of different mechanisms of action that operates within these communities. Probably, as already highlighted for [63](#B63-horticulturae-08-00577), [64](#B64-horticulturae-08-00577)]. Much research has described active the control of soil-borne fungal pathogens, and this topic has reviews [ are strongly influenced by soil quality and content highlight that a common caveat in many studies on microbial communities has been the difficulty in characterizing the composition and evolution of these communities under experimental conditions. With the advent of NGS techniques and the progress in the bioinformatic pipelines, it is now possible to characterize with high resolution the composition of the microbial communities not only at a taxonomical level through the analysis of selected genomics regions (usually the 16S rRNA for 28S rRNA or a functional analysis that aims at the identification of genes expressed in a microbial community. Details on the NGS techniques and their applications in the biocontrol field were of phyllosphere microbiology can be useful to better understand the behaviour and control of pathogens of aerial plant parts.

Recently, Ram\u00edrez-Cari\u00f1o et [ [94](#B94-horticulturae-08-00577)] reported that tomato blight and pepper leaf spot, caused by Alternaria alternata, can be controlled by Bacillus spp. plants from pathogen attack through induction of systemic resistance in the host. Andreolli et al. [ a demonstrates an induction of plant growth in parallel with an antagonistic effect on in vitro growth and development of B. cinerea. Study of the mechanisms of action of bacterial BCAs has also focussed on to control phyllosphere diseases. Lima et al. and De Curtis et al. [106](#B106-horticulturae-08-00577)]. De Curtis et al. [ [107](#B107-horticulturae-08-00577)] showed Monilinia of microbial consortia have led to the establishment of new criteria in the selection of new combinations of BCAs to control soil-borne diseases. Similarly, some recent papers have highlighted the growing on the study of the phyllosphere microbiome as well as its potential manipulation in from biocontrol properties of antagonistic bacteria (e.g., for their capacity to induce plant defense responses and for their promotion) they fruit [ [119](#B119-horticulturae-08-00577)]. Several yeasts isolated from different matrices have been for their ability to counteract [121](#B121-horticulturae-08-00577)].

Application of biocontrol yeasts in contamination, as in the case of patulin and ochratoxin A (OTA) accumulation in apples and in wine grapes, respectively [ [131](#B131-horticulturae-08-00577)]. the the mycotoxigenic pathogen P. expansum, yet the overall contamination of apples is decreased [ [135](#B135-horticulturae-08-00577)]. This appears to be common within the Pucciniomycotina, since it has also one of the main advantages related to BCA application with respect to chemical postharvest pathogen relies on their self-sustaining pointed out that degradation products are less toxic, but not proven be in the long term [ [142](#B142-horticulturae-08-00577)]. More recently, two papers on apple and tomatoes inoculated with B. cinerea cold adapted BCAs for application on fruits (in this case on cold-stored fruits) reducing the scale of Basidiomycete shown for strain of Metchnikowia pulcherrima isolated from apples by Janisiewicz et al. who highlighted how different strains of the same species isolated over time from the described as a \"sister\" species of M. pulcherrima that morphologically was not easy to distinguish, because the latter, being cinerea [147](#B147-horticulturae-08-00577)]. has yet and assembled.

Indeed, it is common that the activity of a single BCA relies on different mechanisms to the a mechanisms of action is crucial to set the criteria to be adopted in the search of new and more effective BCAs [ [7](#B7-horticulturae-08-00577)] (see also [Section et an overview of novel BCAs, which represents an important source of information about the different mechanisms of action their characterization. some cases, single these antifungal enzymes that are directed against cell walls of fungi.

The opportunity of using antibiotic-producing BCAs is strategies mainly the selection of BCAs that do not produce antibiotics for their use on aerial parts of the plant, and particularly on edible ones (e.g., fruit and vegetables) [ [169](#B169-horticulturae-08-00577), [170](#B170-horticulturae-08-00577)]. On the other hand, the use of antibiotic-producing BCAs is considered to be more tolerable against soilborne pathogens [ in concentration-dependent manner having a kingdom spectrum of activity [ [36](#B36-horticulturae-08-00577)]. However, for yeasts and bacterial that rely on VOCs treat VOC production as a good screening parameter for the selection of postharvest BCAs. Tests made on these BCAs were effective in and in controlled storage conditions, but these encouraging results not obtained the activity; however, the list of yeasts Monilinia fructigena and M. vitro Yeast KTs, strain (self-immune their own) an advantage in terms of natural competition.

Furthermore, the biocontrol of Monilinia laxa by A. pullulans is mediated by the production of siderophores that are independent by the presence of the pathogen [ [206](#B206-horticulturae-08-00577)].

One of the on nutrient and space Di Francesco and Ugolini [ [210](#B210-horticulturae-08-00577)], it was demonstrated that the competition for nutrients and space by two strains of A. pullulans is involved in their biocontrol of M. laxa on peaches. This mode of action is based on the active metabolism of the BCA and may affect the less competitive pathogen in many ways [ [7](#B7-horticulturae-08-00577)]. The key advantage of this BCA mode of action is that the resistance of the pathogens to it is more and nematodes, can be in plants to plant [ different signalling SAR induction triggered Ceratocystis fagacearum on oak [ [225](#B225-horticulturae-08-00577)], and (v) Bacillus spp. against Fusarium spp. [ [226](#B226-horticulturae-08-00577)].

This second approach (that has gained relevance over the years due to the evolution of new techniques) is based on the use of molecular tools for the detection of ROS and phytoalexins example, et al. analysed The RNA-seq analysis further indicated the involvement reported the root-endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (Pi) the ability to to Potentiate Effectiveness Fungal Pathogens 5.1.
