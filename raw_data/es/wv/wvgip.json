Therefore, this study evaluates the association between the consumption of herbal supplements or homeopathic remedies to prevent COVID-19 and the intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the LAC region. We conducted a secondary data analysis of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) survey with Facebook to assess COVID-19 beliefs, behaviours, and were calculated using generalized linear models of the Poisson family with the log link function. The prevalence of the use of products to prevent COVID-19 was the following: consumption of garlic, ginger, and lemon An association was found between using herbal 12.8%; CI: 1.50-1.61) to vaccinate against COVID-19. In the LAC population, there is an association between using herbal supplements, using COVID-19 and non-intention to vaccinate it is necessary design strategies for groups that consume these as measures against COVID-19 to increase vaccination coverage and expand the information regarding transmission strategies for SARS-CoV-2.
