The homeopathy proposal focuses on the person as a biological, psychological and social being (which has been emphasized by the World Health Organization in its definition of healt h), which can adequately respond to the needs and expectations of patients their ailments, disease and health, recognizing the person as whole, indivisible and therefore complex, which requires personalized attention. This model is similar t o the current proposal of person -centered care2, that is trying to disease. It aims to improve the teaching of medicine and medical care 3.
