What are mixed neuronal-glial tumors? The brain and spinal cord contain many cells that send messages from the brain/spinal cord to the brain and rest of the body) and supporting cells (glial cells). Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors are a rare group of tumors made up of cells of both types, which vary in degree of aggressiveness. Some are low grade (grade 1 or 11) which grow slowly with almost-normal cells (benign, noncancerous), gene mutations or infections may all play a role in their development. What are the symptoms of neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors? Symptoms depend on the size and location of the tumor, which can raise the pressure in the brain and/or press on tissues close to it). mixed neuronal-glial Wolfsdorf, MD, FAAP](/medical-professionals/for-physicians/weekly-updates-in-pediatrics) Esta p\u00e1gina fue actualizada por \u00faltima vez en: enero 10, 2022 04:28 p. m.
