SATURDAY CEREMONY 14 FROM DECEMBER | from 7pm. to 08 hs. Sunday AMAZON GRANDMA (AYAHUASCA) Ayahuasca or is effects of its ingestion promote access states of conscience in introspections, diverse emotions facilitate awareness of what is happening in our life and the world, not being aware of it we refuse to see it. These traditional uses should be the contemporary science shamans or healers take ayahuasca to communicate with nature or to observe what is causing illness on a spiritual level in their patients, they drink ayahuasca and sing to enter a healing trance. HEALING PROPERTIES Ayahuasca can be an effective therapy in the field of psychiatry and psychology in the treatment of depression and anxiety as well as personality problems and schizophrenia and has been studied for a long time by doctors, pharmacologists, psychologists and psychiatrists of all over the world as a tool for various problems, with special relevance in helping individuals to processes and habits that are harmful to themselves and to others. In fact, its use in detoxification and addiction treatments is a fact in countries such as Brazil and Peru, becoming one of the most cutting-edge treatments for drug addiction. Ayahuasca is not a miracle cure in the sense that you drink the potion and all your problems disappear within a couple of hours. It is, however, in the sense that the effect it causes makes it possible to work with a and efficient way. \"The psychological effects ayahuasca and psychologists for several years. It was determined that the use of psychoactive substances present in some plants can modify the states of consciousness and produce positive the treatment of diseases such as drug dependence \". (Zavala L\u00f3pez 1995). IS IT A DRUG? There are many scientific investigations on the chemistry of ayahuasca and its physiological effects, a context has no side effects and does not generate addiction, one of its uses being precisely the treatment of dependencies in the spiritual therapeutic characteristics; a deep introspection takes place that reveals pleasant or repressed experiences, reason why the ludic, recreational use or the dependency is improbable and inappropriate. Instead of generating addiction, it causes the opposite effect due to the unpleasant taste of the concoction and the depth of the experience, being necessary a time between each take to assimilate what happened and integrate what was learned. \"It is the tool that allows us to open and travel a path of knowledge and health. (...) Fortunately, the barrier towards mass consumption has not solemn for people seeking only experiences. \" (Fericgla 2001) IS THERE A \"BAD TRIP\"? The fear The most common is a so-called \"bad trip\", which for many people is actually something positive because it means that you are seeing your fears and you have the opportunity to identify and face them, in case the patient requires it, will search try to infuse it serenity and confidence to help you in your process, using waters songs. CEREMONY DYNAMICS The entire traditional ceremony is guided by the shaman through songs. In the traditional ceremony, these songs are called icaros and they are sung to Mother Ayahuasca so that she gives access to the healer to see and heal the patient. Having the opportunity to receive Ayahuasca Medicine is something important, it is not a \" chance \", letting us know that perhaps it was time to go further in the process of self-discovery. In general, it marks a before and after because the decisions made after the decision are usually adapted to a better focus on relationships, work, creativity and, of course, the consideration and everyday life. an opening ceremony and taking the medicine, the effects last between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on each person, body weight and their The effect it produces is called colorful visions, scenes such as are dreams and / or deep introspection with such clarity that from this heightened state of consciousness it is much easier for us to resolve everyday issues (such as relationships) and have a in life daily. \"Thanks to the ecstatic effect of ayahuasca and its ability to reveal the unconscious, it is used tool treat compulsive behaviors and personal growth processes.\" (Fericgla 2001) All the Ayahuasca takes are different, so this is in no way a guide, but I will try to explain in a general way the main points to live within the shot. In the case of a ritual ceremony, generally the Taita or shaman who guides smoking tobacco, asking for blessing and protection from God the Father, Mother Ayahuasca and the spirits of the jungle so that he and the participants can receive the healing and openness that Ayahuasca usually gives, the taita or shaman take medicine just like participants. Then each one comes to sit in front of the healer to drink the concoction, asking and thanking personally for personal purpose, there are many variants in this context so that each guide who does a ritualistic ceremony can add elements or do it in a very simple way. of the rules when taking Ayahuasca Medicine 1.- As far as possible stay seated. It is easier to control the effects when sitting than when lying down, where we can sometimes feel a lot of confusion. 2.- It is important to maintain silence, since the experience is fundamentally introspective and individual, to avoid disturbing and or intensifies perception and acquire great intensity. 3.- Do not lose sight of and keep the bag or bucket that is given at hand in case the medicine causes vomiting and ask for support if there is a need to go to the bathroom.
