Knee-jerk our culture urges us to move along, to step away from the present moment. Mexico City-based songwriter and instrumentalist Estrella del Sol wanted to craft a space where there is finally room to breathe, and time to arrange the patchwork of our reality. On new album Figura de Cristal, she encourages fragility, and celebrates the delicacy of our ever-evolving selves. Estrella del Sol is known for her work in shoegaze band Mint Field, hailed for their tender exploration of sentimentality and Sol's in a quieter, more electronic space. \"I wanted to experiment more with my vocals and mainly synth sounds, always trying to find a different explains. The result is a patient and nurturing collection of songs that remind us of the importance in taking our time. Her first solo album, Un espacio de lo imaginario, released in 2020 and recorded in the first two months of the pandemic, introduced del Sol's intimacy of del solo arrangements. Figura de Cristal builds upon this intimacy, adding a blanket of subdued yet glittering drones, haunting guitars It was written, recorded and produced entirely by Estrella del Sol at her home in Mexico City, with cello contributions by experimental composer and personal friend Mabe Fratti and mixed by Mint Field bassist Sebastian Neyra. The album includes field recordings of Estrella del Sol's surroundings, namely her neighborhood in Mexico City. By including these miniature portraits of her reality, Figura de Cristal acts as a kaleidoscopic interrogation into what it means to be alive, and how others figure into the images we create for ourselves. By using the recordings, del Sol says \"the album could feel familiar to my reality at that particular moment.\" Enmeshing them into the album's ambient arrangements, Figura de Cristal threads together the familiar and the fantastical. It's a reminder of the coexistence of multiple realities. When making the LP, Estrella del Sol wanted to create a soundtrack that could replicate the calming notion of a sunset-stroked evening, or the pink tones of a quiet morning. The title track, \"Figura de Cristal,\" replicates the grace of these moments, teaching us to lend ourselves that same grace and gentleness, even during the most difficult days. \"This album became a reminder to me that I have to take care of myself and that If I don't, I can break like a crystal figure,\" she explains. \"I have to learn to empathize with myself and the people surrounding me. That everyone's perspective of reality is different and there's no true answer.\" Figura de Cristal is an album about curiosity, and the merit in embracing our vulnerabilities. There is not one single reality, or experience, but instead an infinite range of truths. Through improvisational techniques and dynamically droney sonic textures, Estrella following your instincts, declares joy "}
