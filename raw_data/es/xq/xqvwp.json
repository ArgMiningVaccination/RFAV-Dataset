The training is to impart Aereal Yoga, the requirement for this formation is to be as Yoga teachers. It is an intensive training so we need that the teacher knows, philosophy, have previous knowledge of the in Spanish and Sanskrit, anatomy and alignment on the ground, since all these skills are brought into the fabric. Although it is a kind of Aereal Yoga, Yoga is above all, we must be very demanding for the message is not distorted and the essence is not lost. e teach students to enter and exit the asana. To care for the student and that due to this practice is carried out in suspension requires considerable care. Fabric positioning regarding the anatomy refers. Many of the asanas investment made in so many students face their fears begin to understand what happens when we change our point of view, which is left and right front is back. They are shown the activated alone which then helps them on the ground to observe more easily, as your body and mind have already registered. Weightlessness allows the body is more relaxed so the student is able to understand that it is easier to delve into an asana from relaxation to tension, which is sometimes difficult to understand in and ground. We use the web as a tool for the ground. Pranayama and meditation practice. We always remember it's a yoga class. Training is always done in retirement. The student is living together in community in the countryside, it is important for us to share, know and feel part of a natural area, caring for the environment and ourselves, all the food is vegetarian and ecological, as well as products is shared and austere. Meditating early in the morning and living in community, where we learn from each other. We try to be inclusive formation that enriches the student and the teacher course.

Sitio Web: www.yogic.es Tel\u00e9fono m\u00f3vil: 609169964 Pedro Pastor Ballesteros Doctor in Health Sciences from the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. Madrid. Spain. Graduate in Nursing. Specialist in Occupational Nursing. Master in Public Health. International Teacher and Teacher Trainer registered by Yoga Alliance. Trained in Raja Yoga at the Bihar School of Yoga. Munger. India. Judo Teacher Black Belt 2nd Dan Founder and President of the Sankalpa Yoga Association. Dr Pedro Pastor began teaching Yoga classes in 2010 trying at all times to share his own experience of many years, always emphasizing that the true teacher or Guru is the one inside each one. He defends the Zen maxim that states \"when the student is ready, the teacher appears\" being on many occasions the teacher himself. He started on the path of Yoga consciously, or at least that's what he thinks he remembers, at the age of fourteen, self-taught. He was looking for that internal part that the martial arts, which he had been practicing since he was three years old, offered him, but in turn did not show him. What he does remember with certainty is that he soon felt the need to incorporate those teachings into his life. Pedro conceives Yoga as a way of life, a vital path, which, away from frills and esotericism, consists of trying to live living congruently, thinking, feeling, saying and acting in the same way. As a Doctor of Health Sciences, his approach in teaching Yoga is often from a perspective of balance in the health-disease complex, trying through the practice of an Integral Yoga to add life to the years and not just years to the lifetime. Trying to convey a restorative, integrative and preventive vision in the practice of it. He lives with a feeling of immense gratitude towards all those students, professors and teachers that I have found on his path, for everything they have contributed to him. During his regulated training he has taken and continues to take numerous training courses in different Yoga schools with different lineages and different styles, both in Spain and in India, always trying to combine and make the most of each one of them, integrating the knowledge of this ancient science, in order to be able to share them with others. Dr. Pedro Pastor feels that each human being is immersed in his own path and it is important to have the possibility of equipping himself with the tools that Yoga provides us to become aware of each vital cycle, respecting nature, the environment, and the body itself, because of that way the human being is able to find happiness and that path likes to call Yoga. In 2019 he began teaching seminars, classes, workshops and Provider (Yacep\u00ae). In 2021 she began to train RYT200-RYT300-RYT500\u00ae Yoga teachers the Yoga Association, with the following objectives: -Preserve the traditional practice and teaching of Yoga collaborating with international teachers and teachers from different lineages and schools. -Collaborate with other associations, practice and of Yoga, but always showing willingness to other perspectives and current ways of showing respect, humility and openness. -Try incorporate the yogic practice, philosophy and habits of life as a lifestyle. the students can be that legacy Buddhist philosophy and how to apply it to live fully.
