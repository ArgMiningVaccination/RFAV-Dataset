Critics allege, from these analyzes, that homeopathy cannot have any scientific or practical value over the placebo effect. These allegations are debatable insofar as they have been used in an international sociopolitical context that presses for the teaching of homeopathy in different universities to be eliminated. In this essay I will explain some historical misunderstandings that are related to the inconsistencies that I identify in the discourse of the detractors of Homeopathy. La Homeopat\u00eda de M\u00e9xico 2018 Homeopathy is a controversial field of study, so much that it has even been considered by some philosophers of science as a fraud. The question of homeopathy as pseudoscience can be approached with at least two strategies: the of and between science or pseudoscience proposed by the philosopher Mario Bunge. We take both approaches and will discuss some points to favor or against homeopathy. Since the beginning, Bunge's demarcation was considered as the most reliable \"evidence\" against homeopathy. A primary goal of this article is to provide some examples to illustrate the debate. At the end, this article demonstrates that the Bunge's demarcation is an act of faith that is ultimately completely invalid in comparison to the contemporary growing body of scientific evidence. On the basis of the discussion presented in the article, the Bunge's must not be used to provide any definitive categorizations. Lic. Andr\u00e9s Amado Zuno Arce. M\u00e9xico. ... Lic.
