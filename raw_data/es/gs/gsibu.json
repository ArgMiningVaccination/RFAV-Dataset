Main There is compelling evidence that the type of nutritional exposure in early periods of an organism's development the structure function [3](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR3), can effect on the target organs ( [5](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR5)) and direct effect on kidney function, an increase in whole body ( [3](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR3), [7](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR7)). One of the target organs affected by early protein intakes is the heart, the development of which occurs in an early embryonic phase. As such, early postnatal nutrition would affect growth since this is the period in which the fastest growth of the body and organs takes place. Effects of protein left proteins can also affect the growth of the heart through a systemic stimulation of the constituents of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis. The rationale in suggesting IGF-1 axis ( [3](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR3), [7](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR7)). The aim of this study to assess the effect of different protein intakes during the first year of life on cardiac mass and function at 2 y of age in healthy infants. Results Study Sample Of the 261 Spanish children remaining in the original European-Childhood Obesity Program randomized to perform the cardiac assessments at the age of 2 y. The assessments were performed between November 2004 and March 2006. The different study groups were composed of 100 formula-fed children of whom 51 and 49 had HP and lower protein (LP) formula, respectively, and 45 were breastfed (BF). echocardiographic obtained in 141 participants); in 4 cases, the triplicate measurements were unsatisfactory and were discarded from the statistical analyses. Triplicate blood pressure measurements were obtained in 110 children (78% of the participants); 31 children did not fulfill the criteria of technically acceptable readings. At 6 mo of age, a blood sample was drawn in 109 children from the 141 who had had valid echocardiography ( [ Figure differences in anthropometric measurements from birth to 2 y between infants who had the cardiac assessment and those who did not. Gender distribution as as anthropometry at birth (weight, length, head circumference) did not differ between the two formula-fed groups, or between the formula and BF groups. Effect of Protein Intake on Anthropometry HP group z-scores with the LP group (0.68 \u00b1 0.77 vs. 0.22 \u00b1 0.84, P = 0.005 for HP and LP, respectively) at 2 y of age. In addition to the BMI z-score, we found significant differences between groups in terms of absolute BMI (16.7 \u00b1 1.0 vs. 16.0 \u00b1 1.1, P = 0.006 for HP and LP, respectively) whereas (weight: \u00b1 1.2, P = 0.173; height: 87.4 \u00b1 3.2 vs. 87.8 \u00b1 2.7, P = 0.445, for HP and LP respectively) nor standardized the feeding groups. LVM was slightly higher in the HP group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (29.5 \u00b1 5.6 vs. 29.13 \u00b1 4.3, P=0.69 for HP and LP, respectively). Similar results were observed respect to the ventricular mass (LVMI) (42.6 \u00b1 7.7 vs. 41.4 \u00b1 6.0, P = 0.400 for HP and However, the HP formula compared with the LP group (69.1 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 66.7 \u00b1 4.9 for EF and 37.7 \u00b1 4.1 vs. 35.8 \u00b1 3.8 for SF, P < 0.05 for both groups) ( [ Figure first 6 mo of life increased EF and SF at 2 y The 0.001), 0.43% during the second month of life (P = 0.001), 0.31% during the third (P < 0.01) and 0.17% during the sixth month (P < 0.05). The EF and SF values at 2 y were independent of the protein the sixth month onwards. Similarly, showed a significant effect on weight assess whether there was a direct effect of type of formula feeding on EF. Results showed that HP formula feeding was increase of 2.03 analyses were similar for SF (data not shown).

Relationship Between IGF-1 Axis, Anthropometry, and Cardiovascular Variables linear associations with weight z-score and 6 mo (total IGF-1: r = 0.300 and r = 0.255, P < 0.01; free IGF-1: r = 0.330, P 0.001 and weight = 0.242, P = 0.011) and BMI z-score (r = 0.204, P = 0.032) at 2 y. No statistically significant relationships were found between cardiac mass at 2 y and the IGF-1 axis parameters at 6 mo. IGF-1 (r = 0.199 and r = 0.201, P < 0.05 for EF and SF, respectively) and blood pressure at 2 y was associated with free IGF-1 (r = 0.303, P = 0.01 and r = 0.389, P < 0.001 for sistolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, respectively) measured at mo only been situations where one or the other was grossly altered, i.e., malnutrition or cardiac pathology. Our study explores, for the first time, the between neonate nutrition and cardiac function in healthy that a is associated with a higher cardiac systolic at 2 y of age. our results in this (Spanish) subsample support the hypothesis that a HP intake during the first year of life (but within the EU recommended range) produces an increase in the subsequent BMI y), increase in protein intake during the first year of life a subsequent increase in cardiac function parameters measured at age. Specifically, with cardiac function was found with of life, rather to an effect of protein intake can be observed 1 y after end the intervention, a body size. would be in line with the proposed mechanism by which an increase in total body function. On the other hand, anthropometric measures were associated with energy expenditure and cardiac function. This suggests that an accompanied turn, depends directly cardiac system cannot be completely rejected since we had found that the type of formula was significantly associated with EF, even in the multiple regression models when adjusted for body size. Cardiac on the body-growth parameters was accompanied by the LVM ( [21](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR21), [25](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR25)). One was protein supplied by among those children receiving the HP formula during the first year of life, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. The lack of significance could be because sample size identification of subtle changes. The short time span over which the study was conducted may have contributed, as well. Our be modulation body size and structure. The rationale for this conclusion was the direct correlation between anthropometric variables and LVM, but not hypertension, secondary to a LP intake with human milk, has been proposed ( [26](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR26)). In our study, we did not find significant differences in blood pressure measurements between the feeding groups, which may be influenced by the young age of the participants at the time of the cardiac study. Role of the IGF-1 Axis the group presented higher concentrations of that inhibits compared with LP and BF groups. IGF-1 concentrations were associated with weight and BMI at 6 mo, while free IGF-1 also correlated with these parameters at the age of 2 y. However, we did not find any relationship between IGF-1 axis parameters (neither total nor free IGF-1, its proteins) cardiac mass. function parameters significant even following distinguish whether nutritional factors that could modulate later cardiac system through an indirect mechanism via overall growth of the body, accompanied by an increased metabolic requirements in children with greater body surface can determine the long-term increase 2-y olds because of the short time course of the study encompassing a short developmental period and the low prevalence of obese infants observed at this age. We would expect slight change in cardiac formula diets administered to the infants, then it would be important to revise infant formula regulations. [ Figure ](/articles/pr201630#Fig5) presents a steps period. increase in early intake could induce an increase in IGF-1 that produced an increase in body mass with the corresponding raise in energy expenditure. A posterior adrenergic response in A potential limitation of this study is the exclusion of blood pressure measurements from 32 infants (23% of the participants) due to or unreliable respect that the IGF-1 axis determinations were performed in a single blood sample. This was unavoidable since repeated blood sampling in difficult Another detect the feeding these limitations, the study provides new data obtained in a group of healthy infants that had been randomized at birth to was with respect to the provenance of the infants. In summary, moderate increase in protein intake during the first year of life is associated not only with higher BMI but also higher cardiac function parameters at we did not find changes in cardiac mass at this early stage of the child's development. The IGF-1 axis may Further investigation was performed in the Spanish subsample of infants from the EU Childhood Obesity Program study is an infants fed, during the first year of life, either HP or LP content formulas; both within the recommended range for desired growth and development. The primary aim of the clinical trial was to evaluate the influence of this variation in protein intake on nonrandomized group of infants exclusively BF during the first 3 mo of life was followed up as a reference group. Dietary intake and growth parameters were assessed y ( [6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6), [37](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR37)). A blood sample was taken at 6 mo of age. Echocardiography and blood pressure measurements were performed at the age of 2 y. Infant formulas had a percentage of the energy content provided by proteins of 7.1 vs. 11.7% (1.25 g/100 ml vs. 2.05 g/100 ml for LP HP, respectively), and follow-on formulas provided 8.8 vs. 17.6% of energy content (1.6 g/100 ml vs. 3.2 g/100 ml for LP and HP, respectively). Equal energy content in both study formulas was achieved by increasing the fat content in the LP formula. Carbohydrates and other nutrients were not significantly different. Further details on the been ( [6](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR6)). The of study formulas complied Directive on Infant and Follow-on Formulae ( [38](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR38)) in place at the time protein contents represented precision of \u00b10.05 kg (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Recumbent length was measured at birth using Seca 232 PED LB 35-107 X (Ellard Instrumentation, Monreo, WA); both with a precision of \u00b11 mm at the age of 24 mo. Body mass index: were calculated ( 2 y calculated. All anthropometric variables were transformed into z-scores, according to the World Health Organization Standards ( [40](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR40)) using the WHO Anthro for personal computers Organization, Geneva, Switzerland). Blood Analyses Serum parameters analyzed at and a 5-MHz transductor allowing bidimensional evaluation Electrics, was calculated according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography as modified by as of ( [43](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR43)). At appropriate cuff was applied with the subject in sitting position on the mother's lap. Not being able to obtain three valid blood pressure measurements was a criterion to remove this variable from the statistical analyses. Total Energy Expenditure Assessment Total boys and girls, respectively. The total energy expenditure was then calculated using the al ( [45](/articles/pr201630#ref-CR45)) at 2 y as: Data Analysis Data management and statistical analyses were carried out with the SPSS Statistics software package version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Descriptive results are presented as Frequency distributions between feeding types were compared with the 2 test.
