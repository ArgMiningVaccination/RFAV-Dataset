Crystal violet stains the nucleus dark blue and the cytoplasm light blue as it binds to proteins and DNA. The method, in summary In short, the cells are exposed to the dye. The excess of unbound dye is removed, its absorbance evaluated by means of a spectrophotometer, or better, a plate reader. Since there is a linear relationship, within a certain absorbance range, between the absorbance itself and the concentration of cells - the greater the number of cells, the greater the absorbance- it is possible to have an indirect indication of the number of cells in the growth vessel. Ad hoc calibration curves, which allow to relationship present, must be foreseen before proceeding with an indirect analysis of the number of cells with these methods. protocol adapted for 96, 48, 24, 12 and 6 multiwells - Plate the cells in a multiwell, leaving at least 3 empty wells (to which you will only add medium) for the blank. - Let the cells grow for the time required (the healthy cells must be well attached to the support) -eventually the or other cell growth studying, unhealthy well bottom Carefully remove culture medium from wells. Wash plate gently with [PBS](https://cellculture.altervista.org/pbs-recipe-and-preparation/)warmed at room temperature place the tip of the tip on the edge of the multiwell and drop the PBS, \"sliding\" it on the edge. Do not pipette the PBS directly onto the cells or you may detach them (e.g., HeLa or 293T cells) - Carefully remove PBS and add crystal violet solution (see at the end of the protocol for the recipe). |multiwell||Volume of Crystal solution, place the tip of the tip on the edge of the multiwell and drop the solution, \"sliding\" it on the edge. Do not pipette the solution directly onto the cells or you may detach them (e.g., HeLa or 293T cells) - Incubate 10 minutes at room temperature on an orbital shaker - Carefully remove crystal violet solution and wash 3 times with PBS (using the same volume specified in the first table) - Invert the multiwell on a napkin to drain all the liquid (the cells are fixed due to the presence of methanol in the crystal violet staining solution) - Add 1% SDS to solubilize the at 70-80% confluence. It is necessary to fine-tune the volume to be used and perhaps combine it if the absorbance falls outside the linearity zone of the calibration line - Agitate multiwell on an orbital shaker for 60 minutes, until color is uniform with no areas of dense coloration in bottom of wells. - Read absorbence of each well at 570 nm - Subtract the average absorbance of the wells without cells from that of each well on the plate to subctract backgruound. The absorbance of the wells without cells, but processed identically to wells with cells, defines the background of the staining method. Crystal Violet Staining Solution (0.5%) -100 ml 0.5 g crystal violet powder 80 mL distilled water 20 mL methanol Dissolve crystal violet powder in water and then add methanol. Store solution in the dark at room temperature. Use within 2 mo. 1% SDS solution - 500 ml 5 g SDS 500 ml water Dissolve SDS in water Store a calibration curve within which there is a linearity between the number of cells in the well and the absorbance of the crystal violet solubilized, necessary a of which must be adhered and grow and absorbance must be evaluated the next day. For example, considering a 24 multiwell, you can plate 100000 or 160000 cells in the first column and then make a serial dilution (1:2) in the adjacent well |100000||50000||25000||12500||6250||3000| too high or low concentrations there may be a deviation of linearity if this occurs, fewer cells will need to be plated or a larger (or smaller) volume of SDS will need to "}
