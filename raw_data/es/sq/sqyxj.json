Please review them to ensure you always select the protocol that best describes how you birded. Quick guide to choosing a protocol Was birding purpose? birding was my primary purpose and... - I know the exact start AND distance of my birding trip: [Stationary](#anchorStationary)or [Traveling](#anchorTraveling) - I do NOT know the time, duration, or distance of my birding trip: [Historical](#anchorHistorical) - I know the start time, AND distance of my birding Not exact calendar date (day, month, and If the date of your birding activity is unknown, or your observations span checklist]instead. Stationary - Your primary focus was birding - You know the exact start and amount spent birding - birding activity occurred at a single, fixed location did not go more than approximately 100ft (30m) in any direction from the starting of your checklist Note: When submitting checklists from eBird Mobile app will automatically set your observation protocol to \"Stationary\" if you stay in the same spot for the duration of your list. Traveling - Your primary focus was birding - You know the exact start and amount of spent birding - You went more than 100ft (30m) away from the starting point of your checklist - You know the specific distance you traveled, or have estimated it to the best of your ability How do estimate distance your distance. The app has a built-in distance calculator that functions even without cell service. This automatically estimates your traveling distance and sets your observation protocol to \"Traveling\" when you move away from your starting point. If you didn't use eBird Mobile, you'll need to estimate the distance traveled to the best of your ability. There are a number of online mapping tools that can help you. Please do not include any repeat portions of trail in your total distance estimate. If you retrace your steps, \"backtrack\", or go out and back on the same trail, report only the UNIQUE distance traveled. For example, if you walked 1 mile down a trail before turning around and heading back, your checklist distance should be 1 mile, not 2 miles. See a more detailed example below: In the example portion of trail, by a 0.3 km loop, then retraced your steps back down the initial 0.45 km portion of trail. Your total distance while birding was 1.2 km. However, because your route included some backtracking, the unique distance was only 0.75 km. You would enter a distance of 0.75 km on your eBird checklist. If you are using eBird mobile: Do not stop your GPS track when you start backtracking. Keep your GPS track running the entire time you are birding, and adjust the unique distance of track) only after you have pressed the\"Stop\" button to end the list. This ensures the GPS track reflects your entire of the trip. Incidental Your primary focus was NOT birding (e.g., your attention was primarily on driving, gardening, reading a book, doing something inside your home, etc.). If entering an Incidental checklist from eBird Mobile you will be prompted for a start time for your list. If you do not know the start time, [enter your \"Incidental\" checklist from the eBird checklists: When you the Incidental protocol, the answer to the question \"Is this a complete checklist of the birds you were able to identify?\" will automatically be set to \"No\". You will not be able to change this selection. Why? For a checklist to be complete, all the birds present and identifiable must be reported. When birding is not your primary focus, you may not be able to give birds around you the attention necessary complete checklist. Because are less useful for [eBird Science](https://ebird.org/science). If you have the time and opportunity (and are not driving!), try to focus on birding for even a few minutes so you can change your Incidental checklist to a complete, Stationary or Traveling list. Please don't eBird and drive! For your safety, when operating a vehicle your primary focus should be driving, not birding. Birds observed while driving should be entered using the \"Incidental\" protocol only when safe to do so. Northern Cardinal by Matt Plante/Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab ( [ML202000151)](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/202000151) Historical - Your primary focus was birding - You know the date you went birding, but not the exact start time, duration, or distance traveled (or you know some of these, but not all three). NOTE: Historical checklists can only be entered from the eBird website. If you know the start time, duration, and any distance traveled while birding, please instead. Historical checklists should only be used when you lack the valuable effort information that is standard on present-day checklists. In general, the Historical protocol should not be used for present-day checklists. Please try to collect time and effort information so you can submit a Stationary or Traveling count. When entering historical data from other sources: - Make sure you have their permission - For each record, include the observer's name in the checklist comments - Note in the account name and/or checklist comments that the data are entered by another party. - If the eBird account used to enter historical data covers [multiple name (e.g., (c.a. 1931) R.H.D [ML31232111](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/31232111)) What are Specialized of protocols Incidental, above. to meet specific research objectives, and require additional information beyond the date, time, duration, and distance of a typical birding checklist.

Repeat this process throughout the trip until you return to within two miles of shore. If you're anchored: Keep a checklist for as long as you're anchored, and then follow the above used pelagic protocol. Royal Albatross (Southern) by James Moore/Macaulay Library at the Cornell Lab ( [ML133489051](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/133489051)) Area The Area protocol is intended for targeted, specialized surveys that exhaustively search a specific area for birds - often when covering the same ground repeatedly. This observation type requires information or park, does not mimic the exhaustive coverage of a standardized/scientific area search, most eBird checklists will be better suited for the Traveling protocol. Banding/Ringing Protocol The Banding Protocol is required when listing birds that you observed This is because rates from banding are very different from normal birding. The best practice when working at a banding station is to keep two separate lists: A complete Traveling or Stationary list including all species or heard (but not [complete checklist](https://ebird.freshdesk.com/solution/articles/48000950859-specialized-data-entry-in-ebird/en). A Banding Protocol list of ONLY captured/banded birds that is NOT a complete checklist When two lists isn't possible, keep a single list with all mist-netted birds and all birds seen or heard in the field; use the Banding Protocol and answer \"Yes\" to \"Are you reporting all This means that you are reporting all species captured in the nets AND all species seen or heard. If you only report the birds that were captured in the nets or only highlights, answer \"No.\" Siberian Accentor by Batmunkh Davaasuren/Macaulay Library Cornell ( [ML78038371](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/78038371)) Nocturnal Flight Call (NFC) Count Protocol NFCs are an exciting frontier of ornithology and migration biology, so we are happy to have a protocol in eBird for nocturnal listening sessions. The purpose of the NFC protocol is to detect and report the nighttime contact calls of migrating songbirds as they pass through on their way to breeding grounds. This protocol is not to be used long.

Report all species including nocturnal migrants and local birds BUT answer \"No\" to the \"Are reporting the call counts in the species immediately heard from that species. Indicate local birds on the ground or on territory with the phrase \"local\" (e.g. a metadata for your array in the Checklist Comments. If you make any change to your system, make sure that is reflected in the metadata. Remote Listening: If you are not listening live (i.e., recording NFCs from a remote location or while sleeping), set up a \"remote listening account.\" Use your full name as the account first name followed by \"NFC Station\" and 100](https://ebird.org/top100). If you make a substantial change to your recording station, create a separate remote listening account to reflect the other protocols not listed above can be selected from the drop-down menus on the eBird Mobile app and web data entry pages. Like the specialized protocols listed above, these protocols developed for not apply to the majority of public birding activity. Please do not select these special protocols for your checklist unless you have a firm understanding of their application and/or are working with our partners who developed them.
