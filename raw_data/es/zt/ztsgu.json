Agricultural homeopathy represents an alternative for ecological agriculture, impacting positively in cultivation development. The effect of four homeopathic medicines for human use were assessed in two water) germination, emergence, and initial development. treatments were stem wet and dry leaf weight, number of all the morphometric variables in function of the different development stages, homeopathic medicines, and their different dynamizations. During germination, greater growth in stem length was observed with ZiP-7CH (5.5 \u00b1 0.98 cm) compared to the control group (4.3 \u00b1 1.10 cm). During the emergence stage, the treatments the stage, LT (94 \u00b1 8.31 cm), leaf number hojas) (131 \u00b1 27.71), fresh stem biomass (BFT) (17.20 \u00b1 2.45 g), wet 7.72 g), dry 0.61 g), \u00b1 0.43 g), and number of under controlled conditions.
