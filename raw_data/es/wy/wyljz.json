The Journal, which publishes 6 regular issues per year, has the promotion of research and continuing education in all fields of Nuclear Medicine as its main aim. For this, its principal sections are Originals, Clinical Notes, Images of Interest, and Special Collaboration articles. The works may be submitted in Spanish or English and are subjected to a peer review process.
