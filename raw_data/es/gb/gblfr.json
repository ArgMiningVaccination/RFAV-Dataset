The present report reviews the current status of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the CKD spectrum with emphasis vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antiviral agents are discussed. S\u00edndrome agudo respiratorio severo coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ha impactado negativamente en todos los pacientes con enfermedad renal cr\u00f3nica (ERC), causando elevadas tasas de morbimortalidad. La vacunaci\u00f3n frente a SARS-CoV-2 han abierto una nueva era, aunque precisamente los pacientes con ERC (incluyendo los portadores de un injerto renal y aquellos en programas de hemodi\u00e1lisis y di\u00e1lisis peritoneal) han sido sistem\u00e1ticamente excluidos de los ensayos cl\u00ednicos. La Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Nefrolog\u00eda (S.E.N.) promovi\u00f3 el estudio multic\u00e9ntrico SENCOVAC para evaluar la respuesta inmunol\u00f3gica tras la vacunaci\u00f3n en todo el espectro de la ERC. Un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de haber recibido la pauta inicial de vacunaci\u00f3n, los pacientes con ERC sin necesidad de di\u00e1lisis, y aquellos en hemodi\u00e1lisis y di\u00e1lisis peritoneal, han presenado una adecuada respuesta humoral (monitorizada con el desarrollo de anticuerpos frente a la prote\u00edna Spike), especialmente despu\u00e9s de recibir la tercera y la cuarta dosis. Sin embargo, los portadores de un injerto renal han presentado una constante respuesta sub\u00f3ptima en cualquier momento de la vacunaci\u00f3n (dosis inicial, tercera y cuarta dosis). Especialmente preocupante es la situaci\u00f3n de los pacientes con respuesta humoral persistentemente negativa que no seroconvierten incluso ni tras recibir las dosis de recuerdo o boosters. En ese contexto, el manejo probablemente pasa por el uso de anticuerpos monoclonales dirigidos frente a SARS-CoV-2 que han sido recientemente aprobados, asumiendo que pueden perder efectividad con el cambio del genoma viral. La presente revision tiene por objeto resumir y analizar la situaci\u00f3n actual de la vacunaci\u00f3n frente a SARS-CoV-2 en el espectro de la ERC enfatizando en los resultados del estudio SENCOVAC. Asimismo, a lo largo de la revisi\u00f3n se discuten los predictores de la respuesta a las diferentes dosis y tipos de vacunas y la integraci\u00f3n de estas con los anticuerpos monoclonales y los agentes antivirales. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the fastest growing causes of death, projected to become the fifth global cause of death by 2040 and the second cause of death in countries with long life expectancy before the end of the century. [1,2](#bib0440) While the increased risk of cardiovascular disease has received most attention, [3](#bib0450) persons with CKD are increased from non-cardiovascular causes and indeed the absolute increase a condition of variable severity that may result in death. Initial reports of COVID-19 indicated that 20% of hospitalized patients had diabetes mellitus (DM), 15% hypertension and 15% had cardiovascular disease (CVD), but CKD was not mentioned [5](#bib0460) and was not considered a risk factor for many months. It is now clearly established that CKD is the main risk factor for severe COVID-19. [6](#bib0465) According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) collaboration, CKD is the most COVID-19 17,278,392 adults risk factors differs from the general disease risk of COVID-19 death, [9](#bib0480) contrary to persons adverse KRT patients have a 4-fold increase in risk in their fifties, as opposed to a 15-fold increase in the general population. [6](#bib0465) In the early pandemic waves in the most affected countries or cities, such as Madrid, a it apparent that, as for other populations, there was also a had a dramatic impact on the epidemiology of KRT. As an example, in Madrid in 2020, 12% versus 2019 while KRT prevalence decreased (1.75%) for the first time since records began. COVID-19 was the most common cause of death in 2020 (33% of all deaths) and singlehandedly increased all the excess mortality of KRT mortality. (A) Global prevalence of CKD by age according to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data. Gray lines represent individual countries. (B) According to these data, CKD accounts for the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in 5.1% of the global population, or 23% of the global population at increased risk of severe COVID-19, as represented in panel B, being the highest contributor to global risk. Data for (A) and (B) from Ref. [7](#bib0470). (C) Risk of COVID-19 death for selected preexistent conditions from Ref 8. Dialysis and transplantation were the conditions that most increased the risk of death from COVID-19 in the OpenSAFELY study. Additionally, the increased risk a risk COVID-19 death than heart disease or hypertension. The discontinuous horizontal blue neutral risk (Adj HR=1.0). Several factors may account on KRT patients, especially during the first wave. Some of them have been transient, thus contributing to the severe impact of the first COVID-19 wave while others may be permanent, accounting for a persistent increased risk HD patients were had to travel to dialysis facilities thrice weekly. In Spain this entailed shared vehicles with other patients at a time when health authorities were actively suppressing masking. [15,16](#bib0510) In this regard, shared transport emerged as a key risk factor for COVID-19. [17](#bib0520) Moreover, at a time of severe constraints in access to ICU care, KRT patients may have been considered to have too low of survival, in a self-fulfilling prophecy. Finally, early therapy for COVID-19 of the useless medication combinations used may have increased the risk of associated with long QT dialysis development of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase III pivotal studies for assessing safety protection against severe COVID-19. this background, SENCOVAC study the aim of evaluating humoral to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at baseline, 28 days, 3 months, 6 months, and samples were a of 96% and 100% respectively that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. This assay was calibrated against the First International for human performance studies samples, considered equivocal and values >36IU/ml as positive, interim analysis 9 months only in patients on HD. [27](#bib0570) During the study, some patients received a third and fourth dose authorities and investigators did not intervene in vaccine prescription. The primary objective of the study to determine the humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (initial after the third dose and after the fourth dose. Since the timing of sampling was pre-specified, at each time point patients that had received boosters could be compared with those who had with a high incidence of adverse events (>50%) but all of them not serious (i.e., local pain, general discomfort, asthenia). The second dose adverse events associated to local and systemic reactions included previous included and analyzed humoral and of complications to SARS-CoV-2. of KT recipients for a suboptimal humoral response, the type for humoral response. Specifically, the BNT162b2 than mRNA-1273 (100cg), the categories CKD spectrum from ref while and between 32 and 36IU/ml as equivocal, based on the Ma BM et al. in a [28](#bib0575) Beyond the lower not after vaccination. The hand, and although heterologous regimens (i.e., the use of different types of as initial regimens had been poorly explored, homologous the titers correlated In the CKD spectrum, 25% of patients had fully lost their immunity at 3 months with and affected all the CKD spectrum. This situation opened a new scenario: when a of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. [39,40](#bib0630) However, not all patients or lack of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection) or the type of vaccine. [38,39,41](#bib0625) With this background, Spanish health authorities (and other governments worldwide) decided to patients who received 2 or 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses and allowed to evaluate the previous negative patients. By groups, receiving proportion of comparison KT recipients (80% vs. 53%), patients on PD (100% vs. 71%), patients on HD (96% KT recipients remained as the cohort even In the impaired the humoral for at low humoral response. A recently published clinical trial assessed the dose effect in patients with that in response was prescription was associated threshold that avoids been identified. Until now, all patients with CKD have been eligible for a full immunization against SARS-CoV-2 with four doses, but the optimal moment needs to report from the general population in Israel disclosed that a fourth every effort should be made to time booster doses just Protection not to the risk of COVID-19 complications and mortality still least in with a high degree of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccines, the availability of booster and increased access to intensive care unit care. [64](#bib0755) Data of the last SENCOVAC report shows that probably with doses and type). Luckily, the pandemic is evolving, and we are now facing the same pathogen but with a different (healthy controls, KT and HD patients). However, the of the response was lower in KT recipients than in HD patients. line, second an patients. The number of anti-Spike specific T-cells was similar Belatacept-treated patients displayed the better humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 Spain, specifically activated T cells were observed in 46 of 69 (62%) HD patients. [69](#bib0780) In France, the ROMANOV study tested and CD8+ specific-T cells in the circulation 10-14 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in 106 HD patients. The majority of patients lower healthy controls. HD and immunosuppressive therapy risk anti-spike CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, previous history of COVID-19 in HD patients correlated with the generation of anti-spike CD8+ T cells at levels similar to healthy controls. The authors concluded that HD patients might benefit a before recipients (8% positive after the first dose and 30% after the second one). In addition, the kinetics of Spike-reactive CD4+ T more 12 months ago and only 36% of those transplanted within the 12 months. These severe recipients did not seroconversion, response. RBD-specific in virus-na\u00efve patients on dialysis in SARS-CoV-2-recovered patients on dialysis, anti-RBD memory B updating of vaccines following viral mutations and periodic booster doses at least populations, following protocols that are well established for influenza. This is currently being done the original strain and the omicron variant, thus offering greater protection against currently circulation. However, while vaccines decrease the levels with standard assays does not on protection. [78](#bib0825) Other the number and frequency of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses in the general population and in immunocompromised people, whether the amount on the vaccine should be higher in immunosuppressed individuals as is for hepatitis virus B, and whether the SARS-CV-2 vaccine will be permanently included in the annual vaccination schedule like the flu. protective measures recommended for immunocompromised persons, [79](#bib0830) including prophylactic, use of antivirals, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such prophylactic treatment these antibodies have already been deemed and are no longer used since they identify epitopes that have evolved as a consequence of mutations, and they no longer recognize the most recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.
