The first COVID-19 vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 entered human clinical trial on March 2020. The entry of the virus into the host cells induces the immune response with the production of antibodies against the coronavirus surface spike protein. However, data on type individuals from subsequent viral re-infection is known. In experimental animal models, SARS-CoV immunization with nucleic acid, viral vector vaccines, recombinant subunit and passive effective against the disease. [3](#B3) However, in animal models or in human coronavirus the role of T cell immunity [4](#B4) Vaccine different is one of important strategies to address the coronavirus disease pandemic. [4](#B4) Vaccine development worldwide The development and distribution of effective and safe vaccines is crucial to the worldwide community for immunization and protection from morbidity and mortality related to SARS-CoV-2. The geographic distribution of COVID-19 and the global need for vaccines require effective vaccine approaches and collaboration between pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies, governments and the industrial and academic sectors, where each sector adds its individual strength. [5](#B5) About 72% of vaccines are being developed by private sector developers, while 28% of the vaccine development projects are carried out by the public sector and different non-profit organizations. [6](#B6) Along with large multinational companies (GSK, Pfizer, Sanofi and Janssen), different small companies are also involved in vaccine development. Hence, coordination of the COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and supply capacity will be important to meet worldwide vaccine demand. The coronavirus vaccine development activity is 46% in North America, 18% in Europe, 18% in Asia (excluding China), 18% in China and 18% in Australia. [6](#B6) Although regulatory frameworks and vaccine manufacturing capacity exist in Latin America and Africa, no information regarding vaccine development is available in these globe regions. [6](#B6) However, clinical vaccine candidate), by the Cuba's national regulatory agency, the Center for Quality Control of Medicines, Equipment and Medical Devices (CECMED) on August 13, 2020, which was the first from Caribbean and Latin America. On August 24, to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity and safety, parallel phase trials in pipeline for early 2021. [7](#B7) In the battle against COVID-19, another milestone was achieved by Cuban scientists when clinical evaluations of a vaccine were conducted by approval granted by the CECMED. [8](#B8) On the basis of the results from this vaccine clinical trial, the Finlay Institute director general expects that vaccine to exhibit 80-95% efficacy. Therefore, for immunization of Cuba's citizens mass vaccination program was planned. of the differ greater coordination of different regions will be required in research and development sector to control this pandemic situation. [6](#B6) Strategies and platforms for COVID-19 vaccine development of vaccines against COVID-19 has used several aspects in vaccine development cellular and humoral immunogenicity, vaccines stability and maintenance of the cold chain. Multiple strategic approaches are critical to vaccine development, since a single platform is not sufficient to meet the global need. DNA and mRNA based vaccines can be developed based vitro. Precision for vaccine development is accomplished by knowledge of the structure of vaccine antigen and preservation of the vaccine mRNA sequence have been used by BioNTech and Moderna, and based on DNA sequence, by Inovio. [10](#B10) Different adjuvants such (GSK) are accessible to to immunogenicity enhancement. [12](#B12) Scale up for vaccines development In order to manufacture large quantities of vaccine doses, the vaccine-manufacturing capacity of the entire globe is needed. Hence, the target of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines development, global coordination of different health organizations in a dynamic and planned way is required. [13](#B13)) Funding is necessary for the vaccine development process. The cost of vaccines, the method of distribution and the maintenance of the cold chain are key elements for global vaccine coverage. The vaccine manufacturing capacity is about 2-4 billion doses annually and it will be sufficient by years [14](#B14) The scale-up process for vaccines large-scale production based on the prediction of the vaccine safety and efficacy testing in phase II or III clinical trials. Several companies have partnered with different manufacturers to scale-up vaccine manufacturing to an estimated level of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. The company AstraZeneca for its SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has made partnership with Serum Institute of India and SK Bioscience (Korea). The Chinese company Sinovac has partnered with Bio Farma (Indonesia) and Butantan (Brazil). Johnson and Johnson has partnered with Indian company Biological E. [16](#B16) low use SARS-CoV-2 S protein or its receptor binding domain as an antigenic protein. The viral entry cost-efficient with 60% efficacy. [20](#B20) Viral vector vaccines These vaccines are made from a carrier such as poxvirus or adenovirus which after modification contains a gene from the virus of used viral influenza viruses. For synthesis of these vaccines, the viral vector genomic sequence is grafted with a part of the viral DNA which encodes of genes with efficiency to evoke the virus-infected [6](#B6) from viral vector-based vaccine development strategies for SARS-CoV and MERS have been shown to be beneficial for the speedy development of the COVID-19 vaccine. [24](#B24) A total of 17 viral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines are already in clinical trials, among vectors. [19](#B19)) of viral pneumonia. A vaccine candidate, based on adenovirus as viral vector which express full-length S protein (Ad5-nCoV), was studied in developed strong adenovirus type 5 vector (Cansino Biological Inc.), ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca), and Ad26CoVS1 (Janssen Pharmaceutical). [19](#B19) The rAd26-S/rAd5-S vaccine exhibited good tolerability clinical expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD (DelNS1-2019-nCoV-RBD-OPT1) has been administered trials has China. vectored vaccines These vaccines are gaining more attention to their efficacy, safety and ease in gross scale manufacturing. They can be to 16 RNA-based vaccines in the several biopharmaceutical companies have announced the establishment of mRNA vaccine projects for SARS-CoV-2. To fight the candidate, the requirement only a DNA template of the evoked human clinical trials followed by a significant SARS-CoV-2 in phase I and II. Although a minimum of 50% efficacy is required by SARS-CoV-2 The target immunogenic epitopes can be easily switched in and out of the vaccine candidates, with the antigen DNA sequence as a template. Hence, to target a newly emerged be immunogenicity of the mRNA could be minimized. [38](#B38) One of the major concerns for mRNA vaccine is the need for ultra-cold storage. However, studies have showed the stability for one week duration. [39](#B39) To preserve the recommendations of are -80\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C for 6 months or 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for 5 days. [40](#B40) For Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273), the FDA storage recommendations are 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C for 30 days and at to -15\u00b0C for long-term storage. [41](#B41) DNA-based vaccines Introduction DNA required facilitate entry DNA in expression of transgene antigenic material by immature dendritic cells, which in association with MHC2 and MHC1 antigens, ultimately present these cells to the CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. [42](#B42)) On January 11, 2020, after the public release of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the design and response was induced after 7 days of vaccine administration whith lower viral load and could potentially reduce of SARS-CoV-2. in a comfortable service. Complacency refers to hence, vaccination is perceived this group of people. Governments may first of trust identified by WHO that must be transformed to general public, thus makes people to develop in vaccination related to the presence of active virus in vaccines are some of the misleading claims causing hindrance lead to non-compliance to vaccination includes distrust of vaccine safety, vaccine novelty concerns about side effects and the long term effects on health. Moreover, inappropriate risk messages from hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccine usage, followed by the evaluation of the magnitude and scope of the pandemic. [52](#B52) Consequently, this may help in interventional tackle this global pandemic. [53](#B53) The acceptance rates of COVID-19 vaccine were (94.3%), while a survey conducted among the general public, there is an acceptance rate of more than 70% of the use of coronavirus vaccine with low acceptance rates in Africa, Russia, the Middle East and different European countries. However, how speedily the majority of the population gets vaccinated will have a major impact on the death toll. The coming few months are important to overcome vaccine hesitancy. [59](#B59) As warned by the World Health Organization, the world is facing another type of epidemic called 'infodemics' that spreads wrong information and misleading scientific claims. [60](#B60) With the advent of vaccine against COVID-19, there is a high hope of ending the pandemic that has disturbed the lives of people around the globe. It is recommended to address the scope and issue of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in various nations as an initial step for building trust among the community. [45](#B45) Conclusion Since the need for vaccine development is a worldwide challenge, it requires collaboration between pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies, governments and the academic sectors.
