Material and methods A total of 420 samples were collected from the study area as follows: 140 samples (TS) (0-10 cm), 140 (10-20 cm), and 140 deep soil samples (DS) (150 cm). The soils were characterized, and the concentrations of Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni were analyzed by atomic absorption photospectrometry following aqua regia digestion. Correlations principal component analysis combined with spatial analysis were implemented in order to distinguish the sources and their classification geogenic robust to in order to explore their potential in the evaluation of a useful and robust background values. The degree of contamination along with the geoaccumulation index, enrichment factor, and contamination factor Co 82.7 mg kg1, Cr 134 mg kg1, Mn 311 mg kg1, and Ni 56.1 mg kg1. In general, the concentrations of Ba, Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni decrease with depth. Correlations and principal component analysis suggest that Cr, Mn, and Ni are contributed by external sources. The spatial distribution of Cr, Mn, and Ni in TS displays a spatial pattern extending along 536 mg kg1 for Ba, 95.9 mg kg1 for Co, 208 mg kg1 for Cr, 464 mg kg1 for Mn, and 90.5 mg kg1 for Ni. The geochemical index, enrichment factor, and the contamination factor register a moderate to considerable contamination in some soil samples. "}
