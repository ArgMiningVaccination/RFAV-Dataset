University of London Press, London, 1928). Across species, a gram of tissue expends approximately the same amount of energy during the lifespan on average (Speakman, J Exp Biol 208:1717-1730, 2005). Energy restriction has also been shown to increase the maximum lifespan (McCay et al. J Nutr 10:63-79, 1935) and to retard age-associated changes (Weindruch and Walford, The retardation of aging and disease by dietary restriction. CC Thomas, Springfield, 1988). However, there are significant exceptions to universal energy consumption during the lifespan, mainly found by interclass comparison (Ramsey et al. Free Rad Biol Med 29:946-968, 2000; Atanasov, Trakia J Sci 10(3):1-14, 2012). Here, we present a universal relation that relates lifespan energy consumption to several physiological variables, such as body mass, temperature and the ratio of heart rate to respiratory rate, which have been shown to be valid for $$\\sim 300$$ species representing different classes of living organisms, from unicellular organisms to the largest mammals. This relation has an average scattered pattern restricted to factors of 2, with 95% ( $$2-\\sigma$$ ) of the organisms having departures of less than a factor of $$\\pi$$ from the relation, despite the difference of $$\\sim 20$$ orders of magnitude in body mass, reducing any possible interclass variation in the relation to only a geometrical factor.

It is then somewhat natural to try to associate the process of aging with metabolism, since all living organisms obtain the energy required to stay alive from such process. Rubner, in 1908 [7](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR7), compared the and lifespans of five domestic animals (guinea pig, cat, dog, cow and horse) and humans and found that the lifespan (total) energy expenditure per gram for the five species is approximately constant, suggesting that the total metabolic energy consumption per lifespan is fixed, which later living' theory [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR1). Decades later, a mechanism was found by which the idea behind a fixed energy consumption per the under perpetual attack from of as free radicals and oxidants. However, 'free-radical' theory has lost support in recent years [36](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR36), with evidence that a reduction in free radicals by antioxidant supplementation in the diets of laboratory animals does not significantly increase their life expectancy. On the other hand, caloric (energy) restriction has been living' it has also been shown to have varying effects on species in a range of 20 orders of magnitude in body mass. Although the total metabolic energy exhausted per lifespan per body mass of a given species appears to be a determined by Rubner [7](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR7), million Joules per gram of body weight for mammals\u2014variations of more than an order of magnitude have been found among different animal classes; this result has also been found by other authors (i.e., [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR2)) and is considered the most persuasive eukaryotes, finding again that the total metabolic energy exhausted per lifespan per body mass is no longer approximately constant among different animal classes and instead increases allometrically with body mass. A summary of the evidence contradicting the rate of living theory can be found in [26](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR26). The origin of such variations in the lifespan of which is of of nature [14](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR14), and a new metabolic rate _{{\\mathrm{O}}_2} M \\({\\mathrm{f}}_{\\mathrm{H}}\\) is a the Arrhenius formula, in which \\({\\mathrm{E}}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\) is the activation energy and k is the Boltzmann universal constant. Compared to Kleiber's original heart as a controlling (i.e., \\({\\mathrm{f}}_{\\mathrm{H}}\\) is a marker of the metabolic rate), and it the advantage being a unique metabolic rate equation for different of animals and different exercise conditions that is valid for both basal and maximal metabolic rates, in agreement with the empirical data [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13). In this new metabolic rate relation can be the total consumed in a lifespan [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13), which is a promising way to explain the origin of the variations in Rubner's relation and unify them into a single formulation. In this paper, we will explore the implications of this new metabolic relation for the total energy consumed in a lifespan and the 'rate of living' theory. The paper is organized as follows: first, we review the results of the new metabolic rate relation found in [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13) and derive its prediction for the total energy consumed in a lifespan in \" [New metabolic second, in \" [Empirical support for the corrected relation of the total energy consumed in a lifespan](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Sec3)\", we continue by testing the empirical support of the predicted relation for total energy consumed in a lifespan, and we implications work. metabolic relation and its predictions for the 'rate of living' theory In the proper mathematical formulation of natural laws, a minimum requirement is that the law be expressed in a general form that remains true when the size of units is changed; this is depend a human construct such the of units. In mathematical terms, this implies that meaningful laws of \\({\\mathrm{B}} of a relation which the proportionality C has a fractal dimensionality, and its value on the units chosen the variables so it does not fulfill the minimum requirement for being a natural law. Mathematically speaking, to qualify as a natural law, the metabolic rate relation must first be rewritten so that the constants with dimensions are universal and are restricted to a minimum number, which in no case can exceed the total number of fundamental units of the problem. [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13); _{{\\mathrm{O}}_2} \\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{H}} \\, {\\mathrm{M}}\\), M \\(\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{H}}\\) is a characteristic (heart) frequency, in the empirical data [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13), valid for different classes animals and for both resting and exercising conditions. Using this formula, it can be shown that most of the differences found in the allometric are due the metabolic rates on body mass are secondary, as they come from variations in the allometric dependence of heart frequencies on body mass. Therefore, \\(\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{H}}\\) can be mathematically seen as a new physiological variable that controls metabolic rates, in addition to body mass, only in the sense that metabolic rates and heart frequencies must increase (or metabolism due to starting or stopping exercise) must be accompanied by an increase (or decrease) in heart frequency after latency period to support long-term increased (or with \\({\\mathrm{f}}_{{\\mathrm{H}}}\\) as that it can be straightforwardly linked [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13) to the total energy consumed in a lifespan through the relation of the total \\({\\mathrm{N}}_{\\mathrm{b}}\\) in a lifetime, \\({\\mathrm{t}}_{{{\\mathrm{life}}}} energy consumption that can be seen as a test of the 'rate of living' theory [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR1). However, since the relation of the total consumed unique all living organisms, the concept of the characteristic frequency must first be generalized. A natural candidate respiration frequency, \\({\\mathrm{f}}_{{\\mathrm{resp}}}\\), since this frequency is observed in animals to be strictly proportional to the heart frequency, \\(\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\mathrm{a} \\, and is still meaningful frequency for organisms hearts. Under this proportionality empirical relation for a lifetime can \\mathrm{f}_{{\\mathrm{resp}}} \\mathrm{t}_{{{\\mathrm{life}}}}\\), will be assumed from now on to be the same number for all living organisms; in [Conclusions and outlook](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Sec4), we will explore the implications of this conjecture for the origin of aging. Under the condition of a constant total {kJ}\\); [17](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR17)) a constant value for in lifetime, \\(\\mathrm{t}_{{\\mathrm{life}}} = which is conjectured in principle for all living organisms. It is important to emphasize that this relation for lifespan energy consumption is not assumed or hypothesized to be fixed, as in the 'rate of living' theory; instead, it is constants (\\({\\mathrm{B}}_0, relation given by only two constants with units: one universal constant (the Boltzmann constant k) and one derived by best fitting the energetics of respiration and outlook](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Sec4)\". Empirical support for the corrected relation of the total energy consumed in a lifespan In this section, we will test the validity and accuracy of the derived relation lifespan [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Equ1))], which per lifespan for all living organisms. For this purpose, we use data from 277 species representing different living birds. data sample, which was compiled and curated by [6](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR6), and listed in the [Supplementary Material](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#MOESM1), including the body mass M, body temperature T total metabolic energy per lifespan \\({\\mathrm{B}} (computed from where the activation energy endotherms a was set to the empirically determined values of 4.5 for mammals and 9 for birds [17](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR17), and it was estimated to be 3 for ectotherms with hearts (from the relative size of the hearts in invertebrates; 17) and was assumed to be unity for for such organisms, which is equal to the inverse of the characteristic time for a of 20 orders of magnitude, for different classes of living organisms, from \\({\\textit{Bacteria}}\\) to \\({\\textit{Elephants a was match the normalization in the best fitted relation (solid blue line) to the identity (dashed red line). Moreover, a slope close to unity (0.997) is independent of the choice of \\({\\mathrm{T}}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\), and for example, if we instead decide to the value of mammals (\\(37^{\\circ to 1.81. Therefore, the relation between the physiological variables (\\({\\mathrm{t}}_{{\\mathrm{life}}}\\), a, M & T) given by Eq. ( [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Equ1)) is [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Equ1)) function of organism's body mass. The relation has an average scatter of only 0.339 dex ( a factor of 2) around the (\\({\\mathrm{E}}_{2019} \\, {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\mathrm{r}} = {\\mathrm{E}}_{2019} \\, \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{b}}\\)/a; dashed in Fig. [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig2)), where 1 dex on a logarithmic - scale refers to an order of magnitude. A fraction of an order of magnitude of scatter is impressively small considering the 20-orders-of-magnitude variations in mass approximately 95% of the departures from the relation that are less colored accurate less than a factor of \\(\\pi\\), suggests that the only missing parameters are those missing due to geometrical factors (as expected from variations in the geometries among species), which are generally on the order of the dimensionless factor \\(\\pi\\). If this is indeed the case, this is probably one of the few relations in life sciences that includes all the relevant controlling parameters and reaches an accuracy comparable to those in the physical sciences. Moreover, Fig. [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig2) implies there is no clear Interclass variations been considered the most 'rate of living' theory, for example, the interclass comparison of in addition within classes, These to the predicted secondary parameters that are not (mainly the parameter \\({\\mathrm{a}}= {\\mathrm{f}}_{{\\mathrm{H}}}/ \\mathrm{f}_{{\\mathrm{resp}}}\\) for living' theory have been most important factor of life is relations and it has excellent agreement with both the data displayed in Fig. [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig1) the tests lifespan per body mass increases allometrically with body mass. For comparison purposes, in Fig. [3](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig3), we plot the total metabolic energy exhausted per lifespan per body mass, \\({\\mathrm{B}} {\\mathrm{t}}_{{\\mathrm{life}}} {\\mathrm{M}}\\), for the dataset studied in but without correcting factors (a, this value also of secondary parameters, which is predicted in formulation. The dashed line in Fig. displays fitted Fig. [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig2), denoted by the dashed blue line and the colored blue region, respectively. The slope of the dashed red can be understood by noting that the dataset in that work is not only larger but are estimated from both the intrinsic maximum lifespan in captivity) and the extrinsic ecological reality (i.e., average field lifespan), where the second estimation can be considered 'noisier' for the purposes of testing the 'rate of living' theory. Therefore, the result found in Fig. [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig2), independence from body mass, is mainly due to the secondary parameters predicted in Eq. the dataset chosen. Conclusions and relation [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13) can be linked to the consumed in a lifespan a constant number \\({\\mathrm{N}}_{\\mathrm{r}}\\) is relation for the total consumed in a lifespan was found [Eq. ( [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Equ1))] that can explain the 'rate of living' theory [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR2), [5](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR5) and unify them into a single It is important to note that Eq. ( [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Equ1)) cycles per and assumption (based on the lifespan energy expenditure per gram) the traditional 'rate of living' theory [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR2), [5](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR5). [Eq. 300\\) find that the relation has an average scatter of only 0.3 dex, with 95% of the organisms having departures of less than difference of \\(\\sim 20\\) of magnitude in body mass. Successful testing of predictions is crucial in any proposed theory according to Popper's deductive method of identifying a successful been considered the most persuasive evidence against the 'rate of living' theory, to only based (lifespan) consumption at the molecular level [38](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR38). This supports the idea that the overall energetics during the lifespan are the same for all the organisms studied, as it is predetermined by the basic energetics of respiration, and therefore, Rubner's picture is shown to be valid without systematic exceptions but in a more general form. since the value determined from Fig. [2](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig2) similar to \\({\\mathrm{E}}_{2019} can an determination of \\({\\mathrm{E}}_{2019}\\), suggesting that \\({\\mathrm{E}}_{2019}\\) is a candidate for being a universal constant and not just a fitting parameter from the corrected metabolic energy consumption per gram per 'generalized beat' directly from the physical relation (oxidative) free radical damage and the origin of aging is most likely related to the striking existence of a constant total number respiration over the lifetime of all of life. Moreover, the relation \\({\\mathrm{t}}_{{\\mathrm{life}}} = \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{r}}/\\mathrm{f}_{{{\\mathrm{resp}}}}\\) quantifies the ideas which are motivated mainly by biomedical considerations, into a simple mathematical form that could be included in a broader life-history framework; this is needed to produce hypothesis alternatively, other byproducts of metabolism) should shed light on the origin of aging and the physical cause of natural mortality. Although this relation \\({\\mathrm{t}}_{{\\mathrm{life}}} in terms of heartbeats per there is evidence to believe that the relative constancy of the number of respiration cycles per lifetime more widely the For example, a reptile such as the Galapagos tortoise with a life expectancy of 177 years and rate lifetime [29](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR29), which within factor of 2 of the value determined for mammals. A more different case is that of birds, which have more heartbeats/lifetime by a factor of 3 [30](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR30); this difference is reduced to a factor of 1.5 terms of breaths/lifetime (\\(\\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{b}}/{\\mathrm{a}}\\), with \\(\\hbox {a}=9\\) for birds and 4.5 for mammals; 17). Among fish, the average number of heartbeats/lifetime tends to be an order of magnitude but in such cases, the parameter a can be as low as 0.5 (i.e., a heart frequency lower than the respiratory frequency; 32), more terms of heartbeats up to \\(1.7 \\times 10^7\\) heartbeats (at 25 C) in a short of 30 days [33](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR33). Simple invertebrates, such as Daphnia, do not have a respiratory with lungs and obtain oxygen for orders of magnitude in total heartbeats (between Daphnia and birds) is reduced to less than a factor of 2 in breaths per lifetime, further supporting that all organisms seem to originates at the molecular level [23](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR23), the number ATP turnovers of the molecular respiratory complexes per cell in a lifetime, which, from model that extends metabolism can account that human cells require the synthase of approximately 100 of ATP daily, to molecules per second. For \\(\\sim 3 \\times 10^{13}\\) cells in the human body and for a respiration rate of 15 breaths per \\({\\mathrm{N}}_{\\mathrm{r}}\\) respiration cycles per lifetime found this to same number of \\(\\sim 1.5 fact that lifespan indeed depends on \\(\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\)) and strongly supports the methodology presented in this work multifactorial testing, as shown in Fig. [1](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#Fig1), since quantities in life sciences generally suffer from a confounding variable problem. An example of this problem, illustrated of the relevant factors, is given in [24](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR24), which clear that in an uncontrolled experiment, the dependence on the rest of the parameters (M, a, T, & \\({\\mathrm{T}}_{\\mathrm{a}}\\)) might eliminate the dependence on the metabolic rate B (in fact, this may be for the same reason that Rubner's work [7](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR7) focused on the mass-specific metabolic rate B/M instead of This only a residual inverse dependence of \\({\\mathrm{t}}_{{\\mathrm{life}}}\\) us perform energy consumption will vary with changing physical conditions on Earth. For example, computing by how much the energy consumption will context of energy per 1 degree increase in the average Earth temperature. This result can be straightforwardly applied in as a function of body temperature (T) and the is a key quantity in the estimation of the energy allocation to fitness, which aims to concerns more or less equally fit, other than the diversity seen in the size, form and function of living organisms on Earth. In the near future, our plan is to generate a (metabolic) theory starting from the new metabolic rate [13](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR13) assuming that it rate in ecology in order to explain a variety of ecological phenomena in a similar fashion as the metabolic theory of ecology [18](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR18) does using Kleiber's law. A first step in this direction looks very promising [40](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR40), as it can show that ontogenetic growth can be described by a universal growth curve without the aid of fitting parameters, can explain the origin of several 'Life History Invariants' [21](/articles/s41598-022-06390-6#ref-CR21) and can show how the rate may actually set several biological times (i.e., lifespan and generation time) and even some ecological rates (i.e., The Malthusian parameter).
