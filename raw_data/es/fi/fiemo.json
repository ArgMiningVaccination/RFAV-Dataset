In theory, most of these mixtures are environmentally friendly, being an alternative to traditionally pollutant organic solvents used in several processes related to organic chemistry and biotechnology. However, recent studies show contradictory results regarding their toxicity. The method selected to perform toxicity studies could be significantly conditioned by some of the physical properties displayed by the DESs. Also, the metabolic capabilities of the organisms/cells used to monitor their toxicity are influenced by their physical properties. In this review, relevant physical-chemical properties for toxicity studies are summarized. The advantages/disadvantages of the used tests to monitor their toxicity and biodegradability in connection with the chosen organisms/cells are discussed, shedding light on their limitations. These findings could be taken as a starting point for designing more accurate DESs toxicity studies covering a wider spectrum of organisms and cells to be used as biomodels to monitor environmental pollution caused by DESs.", "sitename": "Elsevier", "date": "2022-12-23", "cleaned_text": "Informaci\u00f3n del item - Informaci\u00f3 de l'item - Item information |T\u00edtulo: ||Controversy on the nature o Servicio: ||Universidad de Alicante.
