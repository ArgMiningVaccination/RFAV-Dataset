Once you have answered all in person This questionnaire asks about some of the ways the Coronavirus (Covid 19) pandemic has affected our daily lives including school, housing, healthcare, and access to food. Please answer the questions based on the events since the beginning of the Coronavirus (Covid 19) pandemic in March 2020. If you have any questions or prefer to answer the survey over the phone please contact Gabie Mirolli at gabrielle.mirolli@bmc.org or (857) 505-4471.

Instructions for Use The M- CHAT -R can be administered and scored as part of a well-child care visit, and also can be used by specialists or other professionals to assess risk for ASD. The primary goal of the M- CHAT -R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, we questions (M- CHAT Users with the Follow-Up, a significant number of the children who screen positive on the M- CHAT -R will not be diagnosed with ASD; however, these children are at high risk for other developmental disorders or delays, and therefore, evaluation CHAT available for download as well. Scoring Algorithm For all items except 2, 5, and 12, the response \"NO\" indicates ASD risk; for items 2, 5, ASD The Score is 0-2 ; if child is younger than 24 months, screen again after second birthday. No action required unless surveillance indicates risk for ASD. 3-7 ; Administer the Follow-Up (second stage of M- CHAT -R/F) to about at-risk responses. If M- CHAT -R/F score remains at higher, the child has screened positive. Action required: refer for early intervention. If score Follow-Up is No further action required unless surveillance indicates well-child visits.
