For each stage, I will focus on the a global, illicit and menacing drug. 1 I thank the Wilson Center, and its Latin American Program in particular, for their hospitality and largesse this year; Julio Cotler (Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, Lima) for his commentary;Kathy Morse for assistance; colleagues, friends and helpers in the research project represents; and our new son, Danyal Natan, for allowing the sleep needed to put ittogether. 2 And of a larger archival project to unveil this hidden history.

A reliable source on transnational issues is William Walker III, Drug Control in the Americas (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1981)2 This is mainly a synthetic essay-trying to make sense of a vast body of new research in the archives-but the history of drugs also makes fertile ground for trying new methods or from the historical social sciences. Twoapproaches are worth mentioning here. First, this essay draws on the \"new and \"foreign\" actors, dominant of power, and between cultural and economic dimensions oftransnational events and relationships. I hope to go behind and beyond standard diplomatic history narratives of \"drug control.\" Secondly, this essay shares broadly in what can be termed a political or social \"constructionist\" view of drugregimes, an approach with long roots in \"drug studies.\" or their variable social uses and effects, and even shiftingpatterns of supply and demand, drug chemistry or current morality. 3 3 For a feel for this new international history, try some recent anthologies: Gilbert Joseph, C.

Cocaine-purer, more powerful, and more \"scientific\" than coca-was lauded by some of the greatest figures in American medicine, such as William Hammond and William S. Halstead. But doctors developed abalanced appreciation of side effects, and by the 1890s, warnings and fears of another type of use, by thrill-seeking \"cocaine fiends,\" who early studies the making of the \"fiend.\" Medical journals of the late 1880s6 The United States, through a variety of signals and means, sought to encourage Peruvian production of manufactured cocaine).

Peruvian responses to these worldly forces proved crucial to the making ofmodern cocaine as a global commodity.

So, when between 1900 and 1920 cocaine began its transformation in the outer world-from the U.S.-Andeanand the distinctive European link, which now had to be limited or suppressed. The American preference for coca leaf-magnified through the lens of tariffs-was preferably acquired through informal currents of commerce with Peru. Cocaineearned its place as the \"first modern global drug,\" not only in its far geographic reach but also in its broad cultural implications. 12 In one generation, it became inverted in Western medical circles, from a possible modern panacea to anunscientific \"mania,\" and from the hope of exhausted modern \"brain-workers\" to the bane of coca-a benign object of widespread popular use, Gootenberg, \"Cocaine: The Hidden Histories,\" A remarkable text on cocaine's vilified same medical, professional and governing circles that turned against stronger cocaine, with little dissent. Another irony lay in how the U.S., the most avid consumer of both substances, quicklytransformed into the world's most passionate and committed anti-cocaine in what medical historian David F. Musto diagnosed generally as with as 13 For Peru, these were highly confused messages: once so vital to develop, cocaine was now deemed a bad thing. It took many years for Peruvians to fully get that message, perhaps due to the high initial hopes placed on the drug, as well as the Decline, 1910-1940 Cocaine did decline in the years 1910 to 1940, both in worldly prestige and bodily use.

But this era was, significantly, the low-point of illicit or recreational (ab)use of cocaine. The United States was the prime mover in most of cocaine's changes-asEuropeans, Peruvians and other emerging actors watched, waited or eluded them. The sources of American anti-cocainism were complex, and will never be narrowed to one over-riding cause.

Two novel global cocaine chains burst onto the scene: theDutch-Javan colonial link (for Europe through the 1920s) and later, a Japanesepan-Asian network (in the shadows of fictive League controls). Both mercantilist circuits took Andes as worldcocaine centers. The Netherlands first experimented with coca in Java in the mid-1880s, but like others these colonial efforts went dormant. Yet suddenly after 1905, dozens of modern hyper-productive coca plantations, by 1912 more than 1,000 Javan leaf the world's dominant producer of the drug. After World War I, and atelling crisis of over-production, the NCF became a leg of now League-sanctioned21European cocaine supply and pricing syndicates. Yet, with poor prospects, pioneering Dutch commitment to ideals of international institutional cooperation (as in The Hague), the Netherlands voluntarily dismantled their cocaine empire in the late 1920s. Java still raised coca in the 1930s-even Merck N.J., wary of Peruvian leaf quality, invested own plantation there.18 As the Dutch faded, the imperial sun industrializing Japan took off-this time, in an Asian response to League and American norms. Japan planted its firstcolonial coca on Taiwan in 1916 and by the late 1920s, with leading national chemists like Jokichi Takamine at the helm, was making upwards three tons of cocaine a year-i.e., half of official world medicinal needs.

That was one reason for lack of diplomatic pressure to limit or suppress coca. So sometimes such interests got tangled, but the U.S. was not yet a heavy meddler. Where did this all leave Peru? Peruvian cocaine fell into an irreparable crisisfrom1910 to 1940. This crisis expressed itself in many forms; some influenced from abroad but others of a decidedly national ilk. The legal cocaine network remained both depressed and an increasingly regional 5% of its peak in 1900, mainly to Germany, Britain and for a time Japan.

The next time the Americans entered theHuallaga, in the mid-1980s, it was to their \"Santa Marta\" firebase, the beleaguered HQ for a hot regional war on cocaine. Coca cultivators hurried down into even more rugged frontiers; by 1992, Peru had some 129,000 hectares under this illicitcrop-by then, its total criminal cocaine capacity surpassed 1,000 tons. By the early 1970s, the cocaine trail led from the rolling green of the Huallaga and lowland Bolivia to coastal Chile, for processing and transshipments. Thatended with an American-backed General there in 1973-finally shifting cocaine's41current fate to Colombia in the mid-1970s.

Cocaine: Global Histories , the book edited last year by Paul Gootenberg, places in a historical perspective the production and internationalcommercialization of coca and cocaine since the nineteenth century. It puts at the forefront of analysis the long-term change in perception suffered by these products: from one of high international prestige to becoming condemned and ultimatelyprohibited by the international community. Now, in this paper, the author presents us with another ambitious analysis of how specifically U.S.-Peruvian relations became established around and cocaine. This new research adds to thevaluable contributions that he has made generally in Peruvian historiography and for that matter to Latin American history at large. 38This section is an edited transcript of remarks given at the Wilson Center on 11 May 2000.48 These types of studies have the virtue of reminding a of capitalism Furthermore, relations between the United States and the othercountries of the Western Hemisphere have been marked historically by conflicting interests, which in some cases have been favorably managed by the weaker governments. This last idea is in itself an important contribution, since it questionssome 1970s. 39 In a similar vien, I would like to add some comments regarding thedevelopment of U.S.-Peruvian political relations in the last two decades that weredeeply influenced by coca and cocaine. This draws upon the extensive analysis in my recent book Drogas y pol\u00edtica en el Per\u00fa: la conexi\u00f3n norteamericana 40 (in English: Drugs and Politics in Peru: the North-American Connection). In the late 1950s, I had the chance opportunity to chat with three Cuban drug dealers who found themselves in prison in Peru. They explained to me that they landed in jail because they did not have-as the Batista did--any U.S. 39 This theme of weak states confounding imperial ones was fundamental to one of Paul Gootenberg's first book, Tejidos y harinas, corazones y mentes: El imperialismo norteamericano del libre comercio en el Per\u00fa 1825-1840 (Lima: Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, 1989). 40 (Lima: Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, 1999).49officials backing them, and by extension that no Peruvian authorities would help them either, due to Lima's political alliance with Washington. These drug dealers' perceptions-whether or a true or fanciful of drugs as like any other placed in the market. Different interested groups or interest groups will surround them, be they private or public, legal or illegal, at the domestic as well as international levels. This notionwas around well before the vocabulary of \"globalization\" invaded our politicaldiscourse. The memory of this conclusion came back to me in 1990 when Alberto Fujimori was first elected president in Peru. At that time, a tense political situationemerged with the U.S., mainly because the Peruvian executive and military held different priorities and proposed differing solutions to national problems-- particularly the way to handle the growing illicit drug trade. Prior to the Fujimori regime, the U.S. had not been able to much his starkinternational isolation. The populist agenda pursued by the Garc\u00eda administration (1985-1990) unleashed an economic crisis that only led cycle of hyperinflation. Furthermore, subversive movements (principally, maoist their continued to grow, due to the military's50deficient in the systematic human rights. These two conditions contributed to the sustained growth of illegal coca production in Peru during the which allowed to become supplier dealers, who of course, produced the cocaine for final sale in the United hyperinflation led to the continuingexpansion of illicit and informal actors and modes of behavior. By 1992, General (r.) William E. Odom wrote a report to the Hudson Institute in which he claimed that \"for all practical purposes the State does not exist in Peru.\" 41 The U.S. government harbored real Peru's government might totally disintegrate. In this context, the economic and political crisis inherited by Fujimori allowed Washington to exert important enforcement were necessary reestablishing order in Peru, and preconditions as well for control and reduction of the production and trade of illegal drugs. Washington and other powers succeeded in convincing Fujimori (against his campaign promises) to apply E. Peru: for Political Stability (Hudson Institute, 1992), discussed in Cotler, Droga y Pol\u00edtica, 214-215.51Consensus,\" that is to say to implement an economic program characterized by a harsh stabilization component as well as package of structural economic change. Moreover, Washington urged Peru to combine this \"neo-liberal\"economic program with a shift in military strategy that emphasized intelligence activities, to efficiently combat both political subversion and the drug trade. In this scenario, Washington put pressure on Peru to adopt certain policies andfight the drug condition for receiving badly needed U.S. economic, political and military aid, indispensable for the problems of hyperinflation and subversion. Notwithstanding the urgency for full American support, the Fujimori administration did not follow the North-American strategy for fighting the coca peasants. Their on the probability thus worsen the military conflict (as isobservable today in Colombia). The American government had to grudgingly accept this reluctance. It had a special interest in addressing Peruvian dilemmas; though Peru is of modesteconomic and political importance, drugs and guerrillas were seen as wider and more critical regional problems. So, paradoxically, these weak circumstances gave the Peruvian government possibility press Washington to accept its positionand, furthermore, to receive some special attention.52 The personal involvement of Hernando de Soto42 in the negotiations with Washington made it possible for the White House to grudgingly accept the Peruvian position. This was because of the influence that de Soto had wonthroughout Latin America and even within the U.S. with vision- actually new legal-economicinfrastructure for reduce production of coca and work toisolate peasants from the terrorist movements. On the other hand, CIA) favored understandings between Peruvian military officers and both the American military and the DEA (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration). The early-1990s reinforced ties between Fujimori and overseas private and public financial institutions. The weakening of the subversivemovements-climaxed by De Soto, gadfly author of the influential \"libertarian\" book, The Other Path (US ed., 1989) and head of the Institute for Democracy and Liberty (IDL) in Lima, a well-know think- tank, supported by the U.S.53This outcome also strengthened links between Peruvian and American militaries, and has allowed Montesinos to consolidate his privileged position within both the Peruvian military and the civil government. For his ability to restore the country's governability, Fujimori was exalted by Washington, Wall Street and the multilateral organizations, and was even touted as a symbol or hope of what all Latin American presidents might get done. In thisway, Fujimori proved able to multiply the support of strategic economic, politicaland military institutions, national and international, and also aroused support from different social actors in Peru for the recuperation of waning state authority. All the while, only the all offers of such leaders for political negotiations. Fujimori and Montesinos, the strong man of the armedforces, believed that participation of other political forces in Peru's economic program, and anti-subversive and in the way of governability. helpsexplain State and White House reacted against the anti-constitutionalacts and goals of the Peruvian military, as well as those by governments of Bolivia,54Brazil and Guatemala, that all seemed intent on destroying democratic procedures in the name of governance. It seems that the some general confrontation occurred within the U.S. administration itself, between those officials working to fosterhuman rights and democracy overseas and those military and intelligence agents willing to subordinate these from and militaryinstitutions, it was mainly his base of domestic support fraudulent a new Congress, Judiciary and electoral bodies, Fujimori laid the foundations itself because of a mixed internal support base for a civil-military regime. Nevertheless, Washington-specifically the assailed for their tepid interest in fighting the illicit trade of coca and as American politicians, the Peruvian government soon expanded the authorityof the armed forces, and of the military judicial system, in the struggle against the55drug trade. This militarization but it also deepened military involvements in Peruvian society and politics. Since 1994, military agreements with Washington to intercept cocaine exporting air flights have led to systematic reductions coca cultivation in Peru (as well as the dramatic shift of to Colombia itself). again,the settled a long-seething border situation--helped Fujimori polish his image as a maker of government authority, all to the benefit ofhis international successes were obtained through an illegal concentration power in Fujimori and through the growing autonomy ofMontesinos as chief of the intelligence services and the armed forces. Such a combination left no room for government accountability crony-ism and clientelism--social the overwhelming subordination of Peru's judicial, civil and military power to the personal interests of Fujimori and Montesinos; the repression andblackmail against the political opposition; the by intelligence56services over the news media, especially television; the use of state agencies (with multilateral funds for anti-poverty programs) for favoring the governing bloc, helped Montesinos to amass evermore discretionary powers andan arbitrary disregard pattern goes against the long-term interests of civil society and its legal and policing institutions, including the fight again drugs, for law.

Nevertheless, such practices have come under increasing fire from actors. The intense unease of certain American officials with this outcome continues since Fujimori could undermine all past successes as well as encourage other countries to follow the same anti-democratic the of so- called \"authoritarian liberalism.\" Such uneasiness was felt when once again attempted his re-election withmassive State Department, House Congress opened an unexpected campaign against electoral fraud movement even was seconded by the reigning U.S. \"drug-czar\" General (r) Barry McCaffrey,43 the OAS, the European Union and by a few Latin American governments.
