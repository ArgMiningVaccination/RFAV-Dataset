Hardy, MD Because the ayurvedic herb Gymnema sylvestre is becoming an increasingly ingredient in diabetes and weight-loss is that care providers familiarize with its uses and properties. A venerable history supports the use of this herb for diabetes. Classical Ayurvedic texts recognize a condition gymnema, to as the woody climbing vine has been used centuries in Indian traditional medicine to treat \"honey or what conventional Western medicine calls diabetes, a disease that has been diagnosed in Ayurveda for more than 2,000 years. In fact the concordance between the Ayurvedic diagnosis of madhu meha and the Western disease of diabetes is so close that Ayurveda recognizes both a congenital type of this disease and an acquired type, which correspond to our Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.1 Gymnema or gurmar, to use its common Hindi name, means sugar destroyer, because it was noted that chewing the fresh leaves temporarily destroyed the taste of sugar plant material) of the leaves include the reduction of sugar in the urine, as a remedy for fever and cough, as disorders.2-4 There have even been references for use of the root in the treatment of snakebite.4,5 However, since first studied by the British in India during the 19th century, modern herbal medicine has focused on the use of the gymnema leaf to decrease blood sugar. According to a recent review, gymnema is the herb most frequently studied in human clinical trials of diabetes, single agent or in traditional Ayurvedic formulas.1 Additional information from phytochemical research and animal has elucidated a unique set of mechanisms for controlling blood sugar. data plus a number clinical trials, largely conducted in India, a Constituents A number of constituents have been isolated from this plant since the first chemical studies were reported at the end of the 19th century. The gymnemic acids, which were first isolated by Hooper in 1889, appear to be the most important constituents for lowering blood sugar.2 These exist in the plant in a complex mixture of at least nine closely related compounds, The physicians the efficacy of gymnema for diabetic patients, and the evidence suggests that this herb can lower blood sugar. Various preparations have been sugar gymnema has been shown to cause increased insulin release from isolated islet cells as well as from animals with an intact pancreas.11,12 However, the pancreas is not essential for gymnema's action as it can still normalize blood sugar in animals without any remaining beta-cell function.11 Actions of the herb have been identified involve the liver and a variety of hepatic glucose production and storage, which uptake from blood into cells.13 Some evidence exists for a reduction in absorption of glucose from the small intestine,14 and results of some animal trials have even suggested have been studied or observed in humans. An additional concern in people with diabetes is dyslipidemia. Gymnema also has been shown not decrease the perception of sweet taste. Traditionally, after chewing the fresh leaf, it was noted that the sense of sweetness was decreased for up to two hours. Bitter tastes also are effect the gymnemic acids and gurmarin. This effect is achieved by efferent nerves responsible clinically significant effect. Subjects who were previously exposed ate fewer total calories when offered ad to typical junk food. The effect was attributed to the effectiveness of gymnema on Type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus are limited and most are flawed in their methodology. The number of eligible studies multiple herb described are single herb trials of gymnema. A case series of eight Type 2 diabetic patients given 10 mg of dried Gymnema sylvestre 21 days found mg/dL at 21 days (P < 0.05) as compared with the same patients prior to treatment with gymnema.20 The study also found a non-significant increase in body weight of 0.9 kg in the subjects during this same 21-day period. There was no comparison group for this trial. The same author published a controlled clinical trial dose) for a total of 21 days.21 The patients were not assigned to groups randomly and nor from 80.8 71.6 mg/dL) day 7. arm experienced FBS 133 mg/dL) post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS, 215 mg/dL to 142 mg/dL) at 21 days. The the in both FBS and PPBS at day 7, but not at day 14. Decreases also were reported in total cholesterol for patients (284 mg/dL 200 mg/dL, respectively). P values were not provided for this short, non-randomized study. A longer controlled clinical trial followed 47 already stable on their medications with incomplete control. For half of the patients, their usual treatment continued. For the other half, 400 mg/d of GS4, a specific extract of gymnema, was added to their usual regimen. The average HBA1C in the GS4 group fell from 12% to 8.5%; decreased and triglycerides improved from 260 mg/dL to mg/dL from mg/dL to 140 mg/dL, respectively. All results were significant at the P < 0.001 level. In the GS4 treatment group 23% of these patients were able to stop all hypoglycemic agents except for the gymnema. There are several cautions interpreting this study. The patients were not allocated randomly to treatment groups and there were differences matched for weight and body mass index (BMI). In a small, short-term study, 10 healthy volunteers and six patients with Type 2 diabetes were given 2 g of an aqueous decoction of the shade-dried leaves of gymnema three Significant reductions in both PPBS were demonstrated. 10 days, significant reductions were seen in the FBS of both normal (80.2 mg/dL to 69.2 mg/dL; P 0.05) and Type mg/dL to 121.1 mg/dL, P < 0.01) in the Type 2 group. Only one study evaluated the effectiveness of gymnema in Type 1 63, 8-30 years old).23 Thirty-seven patients continued their usual 27 insulin-dependent patients added 400 mg/d of gymnema to their usual insulin regimen for eight months. The average insulin requirement in the supplemented group 60 45 uNPH/d. All gymnema patients at least dosages. Unfortunately, 40% of the patients dropped out before the end of the study due to persistent hypoglycemia in one patient and logistical difficulty with follow-up for the remainder. As a group these trials are very suggestive of a positive effect for gymnema on blood sugar in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. This coupled with the Weight Gymnema The subjects randomly allotted to one of three groups and received three times a day before meals either 4,667 mg a with 4 mg of niacin-bound of a standardized gymnema extract 25% gymnemic acid), or placebo. to eat a 2,000 cal/d diet and regularly. trial lasted Both groups recorded a decrease in their BMI of 5-6% and the placebo group did not change. Total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides decreased for both HCA-SX groups. There was however no difference in response between the two the observed cannot be primarily attributed the added gymnema. levels were not reported for this trial. Adverse Reactions/Contraindications To date, no adverse reactions or toxicities have been associated with the use blocking effect on the tongue for sweet taste if the leaves are chewed or a gymnema preparation is held in the mouth, but again, this is considered part of its therapeutic properties. Because of the likelihood gymnema form of a dried extract of the leaves. It is usually standardized to 25% gymnemic acid. The dose most often advised, according to a survey of internet sellers, is 400 mg three times per day before meals. This standardization and dose corresponds with the GS4 extract studied in many of the Indian trials. array of choices tea. Conclusion Gymnema is an herb with more than 2,000 years of recorded use, and it has been prized for at least that long for its hypoglycemic properties. Clinical evidence to date is suggestive of therapeutic are small positive effect on the blood sugars of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients. Many, but not all of the trials also showed a positive effect on blood lipids. There is no evidence to date for its efficacy in weight loss. Recommendation Gymnema may have a place as an adjunct in the treatment of diabetes that does not require medication or as a novel aid to modify taste and limit sweet consumption. If the patient and/or the provider decide use in conventional medication, careful to prevent hypoglycemia.
