It is a unique experience that combines meditation and a relaxing walk in nature. This meditation session is interspersed with a relaxing walk, silence and a short open talk about a series of fundamental issues. What attendees need to do is give full attention, observe themselves and feel the oneness with nature. It last 2 hours or so. Fees: a small contribution of 10 euros from each atteedee to support this pure initiaitve. (Pay via Tikkie when gathering at the beginning of the event.) Location: forest, nature reservoirs and green parks in the Netherlands (in or near Amsterdam). Each event may have a different location. The organizers are Cico and Joyce, who are geographically from China and have lived in the Netherlands in the past decade. From the east to the west, people live a different life outwardly according to different patterns, but the absolute necessity of being human beings who are free of any patterns. They are doing whatever they can to facilitate human beings to come upon the nameless thing that nurtures a meaningful life. Cico is the speaker of the meditation session to facilitate the attendees to see the light, and Joyce guides the walking route and takes care of the enrollment. Please be aware that this is NOT a social event for the chattering state of mind; when the mind is silent, everything stays in the right place; however, inner silence is always vulnerable; it is being endangered in this more and more dangerous world.
