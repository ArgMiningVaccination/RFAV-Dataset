Gradually, between COVID-19 of kidney pathology are not fully known in children; remains a challenge to distinguish between intrinsic kidney pathologies that were caused directly by viral which occurred as a result of multisystem inflammatory syndrome due to the infection. This challenge is made more difficult in children, due to the ethical limitations such reviews have not yet been published for children and adolescents. We describe the results of a systematic review for and adolescents. A systematic literature search of published data up until 31 October was completed through COVID-19 infection were included for qualitative review. COVID-19 infection status was defined by a positive result from a RT-PCR, or nuclear antibody testing. Only full-text articles published in the English language were selected for review. Results: Twenty-nine cases from fifteen articles were Nephrotic disease remission noted in with steroid for COVID-19. There were no mortalities reported in any of the included cases, COVID-19 infection. The clinical and presentation these cases support the mechanistic COVID-19 infection and the the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in March-April 2020. All COVID-19 patients with de novo neurologic manifestations were eligible. RESULTS: We 222 COVID-19 centres patients (61.3%) were male. COVID-19 was severe or critical in (IQR) delay of 6 (3-8) days COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, days in encephalitis, 12 had multiterritory ischaemic strokes, with large vessel thrombosis in 16 (28.1%) 97 patients (43.7%) was analysed, with 18 patients and a positive BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) imaging data is dispersed in numerous publications. A cohesive literature review is to be assembled. OBJECTIVE: To existing patients including children and pregnant women, artificial intelligence applications and practical recommendations. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed/med line electronic databases. RESULTS: The radiology department's staff is on the front line of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Strict adherence to precautionary shortage and low are found in the review offers exhaustive analysis of the current literature on imaging in with overgrowing demands in fields of health care; yet, reproductive care, particularly pregnancy care remains a special focus of interest. Pregnancy is a major physiologic change that alters specifically the women are more susceptible to respiratory pathogens compared to the others. The current pandemic serious consequences on pregnancy whether directly or in symptomatic patients with acute Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lymphocytopenia is one of the most prominent laboratory findings. However, to date age and gender have been considered in assessment of COVID-19-related cell count alterations. In this study, the impact of COVID-19 as well as age and gender on a large variety of lymphocyte subsets was analyzed in 33 COVID-19 total cytotoxic helper T cells are reduced in patients with severe COVID-19, and this found all except for CD4+ multivariate analysis however, we show that in addition to COVID-19, there is an age-dependent reduction of total, central memory (CM), and early CD8+ alone, and not to COVID-19. By contrast, decreases in other subsets could be largely attributed to COVID-19, and only partly to age. In addition to COVID-19, male gender was a major factor influencing lower counts of CD4+ and their subsets are reduced in patients with COVID-19, but that age and gender be when interpreting Care Unit in prone position: report of three cases.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-20238718) The lying in the supine position, not even for the time required to insert a central venous catheter. safety well-being reduces of tracheal extubation and loss of in-situ vascular lines. eea COVID-19 refers to viral respiratory infections and is the predisposing factor for the development of venous and arterial thrombotic in the group of patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia. There have been an of reports of peripheral arterial thrombosis as well. Most cases of arterial thrombosis are noted in critical ill patients in intensive care increase of cases of asymptomatic or mild forms of COVID-19. Herein, we report with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, who studies, case series and case reports published in English or Chinese between 1 January and 1 May 2020 were included. Reports with only paediatric or obstetric cases were disturbance (self-reported in up to 68% and 85% of cases, respectively), gastrointestinal symptoms (up to 65.9%) and rash (up thrombocytopenia (up to 30%). Hypercoagulability resulted in venous thromboembolic events up identified: (a) phase with possible gastrointestinal, ocular and cutaneous involvement and the against this infectious emerging evidence about the potential nutrients on COVID-19 of databases including Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, and PubMed, as well as hand-searching in Google Scholar (up to 10 February 2021) was conducted. All human studies with different study designs and without limitation on publication year were included except for non-English-language and review articles. Overall, out of 4412 studies, Four studies impact of supplementation with vitamin C, 4 studies - zinc, 8 studies - vitamin D, and 3 studies investigated the combination of 2 (zinc and vitamin C) or 3 (vitamin D, vitamin B-12, and magnesium) nutrients. Although micronutrients zinc may modulate immunity and alleviate the severity and risk of infection. The effectiveness of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc on COVID-19 was different based on baseline nutrient status, the duration that supplementation with high-dose vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc may it may demonstrate the involvement of other systems i.e. cardiovascular system (CVS), central nervous system (CNS) or gastrointestinal system (GI). few alarming facts about Covid-19, that, when it hits the brain, can cause some serious complications like; psychosis, stroke and dementia. CASE PRESENTATION: about two patients, having PCR confirmed Covid-19 and radiographic evidence of stroke, who eventually died during hospital stay. Data collection was done after informed consent and in retrospective manner. eea We describe a cost-effective solution to limit aerosol transmission to the surgeon and INTRODUCTION: high density of COVID- 19 patients is unneglectable. The aim of this study is to determine the extent of surface contamination in coronavirus central hospital of Ilam province in western Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 205 samples were taken from potential COVID-19 and its vaccines / Alteraciones hematol\u00f3gicas como consecuencia de COVID-19 y sus vacunas](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ru/covidwho-20244331) eea El virus SARS-CoV-2 contin\u00faa infectando a millones de individuos en el mundo. Aunque los s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s frecuentes observados en los pacientes con COVID-19 son fiebre, fatiga y tos, en los casos severos la hipercoagulabilidad y la inflamaci\u00f3n son dos condiciones que pueden producir complicaciones y causar da\u00f1o en \u00f3rganos, poniendo en riesgo la vida del paciente. Con el fin de clasificar a los pacientes durante el triaje, se han explorado diferentes marcadores hematol\u00f3gicos, incluidos el recuento de plaquetas, linfocitos y eosin\u00f3filos, y la relaci\u00f3n neutr\u00f3filos/ linfocitos, entre otros. Por su parte, para la evaluaci\u00f3n de las coagulopat\u00edas, se vienen determinando marcadores como el d\u00edmero D y el fibrin\u00f3geno. En esta revisi\u00f3n se abordan las coagulopat\u00edas y los par\u00e1metros hematol\u00f3gicos en pacientes con COVID-19, al igual que las anormalidades en la coagulaci\u00f3n como la trombocitopenia tromb\u00f3tica inmune inducida por las vacunas contra el SARS-CoV-2 The SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to infect millions most symptoms observed in patients with in severe cases hypercoagulability and inflammation are conditions can cause complications and organ failure, putting the patient's life at risk. order to classify the and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Current data in the world and in Brazil show that approximately 40% of patients who died have some and the presence of lymphopenia in patients with COVID-19. Our team and others have shown that increased cytokines are the link between arrhythmias/Left ventricular and the immune system in different addition, it has been well demonstrated that lymphopenia can not only be a good marker, but also a factor that causes heart failure. Thus, the present review focused on the role of the immune system upon the cardiac cardiac cells. Therefore, here it will be "}
