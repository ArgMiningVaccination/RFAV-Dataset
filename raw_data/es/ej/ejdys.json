The future of the bivalve mollusk production sector worldwide is still challenged by emergence of new diseases, coll ateral In order to reduce the use of conventional methods, homeopathy for aquaculture emerges as Argopecten model organisms due to their susceptibility to vibriosis compared to other commercial bivalves. The experimental design included three replicates of five homeopat hic treatments at decimal (D) or to T1 treatments Treatment T4 did not show a effect on an imm unomodulatory production sector worldwide is still challenged by the emergence and propagation of new diseases that are strongly influenced by water temperature increase due to global et al., The main limiting factor for hatchery spat production in sea bivalves is the high mortality associated with the disease caused mainly by Vibrio spp, and moreover, by spp. in early - stage development (Kesarcodi -Watson et al ., 2008 negatively affect beneficial gastrointestinal microbiota al., 2012), use generates antibiotic resistance in more pathogenic 2013). Even governments and organizations in different parts of the world have been restricting the use of antibiotics in animal production (Kesarcodi -Watson et al., 2008), but at the same time, there is an increasing need for finding alternativ e ways to control microbial diseases in aquaculture. To avoid the massive use of antibiotics, scientists have been searching for sustainable alternatives as immunostimulant (Wang et al., 2017) with probiotics (Prado et al ., 2010; Abasolo -Pacheco et al ., 20 17), 66 Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research antimicrobial essential oils (Romero et -friendly alternative, has been to strengthen biological systems against and uses dilutions high - dilution) potencies (Bellavite & Signorini, 2002). Homeopathy has been considered a pioneer in nano - medicine application for human health because even in high-dilution homeopathic drugs, nanoparticles o f the original compound have been found (Bell et al., 2013). The action mode of these drugs depends on the potency of the produce effect and as-Neto et al., 2017). Most studies have been done in humans, while organisms, information is scarce. (Merlini 2014), survival (Dias - Neto et al ., 2017) and growth (Merlini et al mollusks, homeopathic d rugs have been used as a novel solution to aid overpass bacterial attack the of homeopathic drugs in marine bivalves and their implication in the system and general condition is scarce. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant system, hemocytes count and general condition index in Catarina scallop juveniles under laboratory conditions. species was an important resource in the Baja California Peninsul a and highly susceptible to vibriosis (Luna - Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002) which causes massive mortalities at their early -life stage. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the potential of homeopathy for aquaculture as a new eco -sustainable alternative to improve hatchery production of spat for aquaculture MATERIALS AND METHODS Origin of scallops and experimental design A total of 1,500 Cat arina scallops (average length 1.98 \u00b1 0.1 cm) were collected culture cages at La Paz Bay, Mexico (24\u00b09'5\"N; 110\u00b020'10\"W) in March 2016. Scallops were transported to the mollusk s laboratory at Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR) and maintained in a nursery upwelling recirculating system at mL-1 and Chaetoceros proportion 1:1) \u00b5m) and UV-irradi ated was continuously provided every day. After acclimatization, scallops were transferred to 24 units (36 L container) with 52 scallops each. During the experimental period (21 days), scallops were kept in an open -recirculating flow system that provided filtered and treated sea water (1 \u00b5m, activated carbon and UV irradiation) with a mix of microalgae I. galbana and (199,607,794 athic treatments (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) and three control treatments (C1, C2, and C3) were including activity in shrimps (Hern\u00e1ndez -L\u00f3pez et al., 1996). Distilled water was used as the final dilution vehicle in all \"working\" (decimal or centesimal) homeopathic dynamizations to avoid this potential effect. The ope n flow was cut off three hours a day to avoid the presence of microalgae and permits homeopathic or control treatments were directly the experimental units \u00b5l a dose that had ventricosus this maintained to homeopathic control juvenile scallops. Growth and survival were measured every week. At the beginning (T o, day 0) and the end of the experiment (day 21), 18 scallops were randomly collected from each treatment for analysis purposes (six scallops per unit). For the histological analysis, the whole scallop meat was fixed in Davidson solutio n. For developed formulated in decimal (T1) or (T2) dilutions/succussions from centrifugation 4\u00b0C, Inc.) for 2 min. was diluted (1:1) in ethanol 87% (Similia\u00ae at 3,200 rpm mixer, Benchmark Scientific Inc.) rpm (Benchmark mixer, Benchmark Scientific Inc.) to get a final mother tincture, from which, decimal (D, 1:10) and centesimal (C, 1:100) commercial scorpion Rhopalurus junceus . Distilled water was count The hemocyte was immune system activation by the with Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) to count the number of hemocytes seen in a tissue homogenized in phosphate buffer 50 mM, pH and a fast prep (2 cycles, 4 m s-1, 30 s) equipment. Samples were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 10 min) and the to effect of treatments on the antioxidant system the Catarina scallop. The SOD activity was determined using the SOD determination kit (Sigma -Aldrich #19160) which measures the percentage of a water - soluble tetrazolium salt (WST -1) complex -Adrich 68 Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research #B6916) to express SOD activity as U mg protein-1. The CAT activity was determined by the method of Clair borne (1985), where H 2O2 decomposition was determined, and one unit of enzyme activity defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 1 mmol of min. Histological analysis Davidson preserved scallops from treatment dehydrated, embedded in Paraplast XT (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA), cut at 4 \u00b5m sections, mounted in glass slides and stained with hematoxylin three images taken at 20 x were processed with Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA) in three tissues (smooth and striated muscles and digestive gland). The information was used the gross physiological condition of juveniles using digestive g formula DGI: DGI (%) = (CAA / TCA ) \u00d7 100 (1) where CAA is the coverage area of the individual adenomeres (\u00b5m2), and TCA is the total coverage area of the image (\u00b5m2). Muscular where CAIM is coverage area of individual muscle - fiber packages (\u00b5m2), and TCA is the total area of image (\u00b5m2). Biochemical distilled water, and homogenized to obtain crude extracts proteins was done using the method of Smith et al. (1985), which nm. Carbohydrate content was determined according to Roe et al. (1961), using a reagent and dextrose solution as the standard (Vedco #3803); absorbance was read at 630 nm. The (phosphor -vanillin 0.2% and sulphuric acid 80%). A mix of triglycerides and cholesterol (Sigma - Aldrich Lin -Trol B -1153) was used as a standard; absorbance was recorded at 540 nm. Growth and survival Growth and survival of scallops during the experiment were evaluated every week for 2 1 days by sampling 30 ind per replicate. Survival was assessed identifying organisms as either alive removing dead organisms from the experimental units to prevent poor quality. in length measure organisms shell length using the program Image Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Statistical analysis For each triplicate, data normality was initially analyzed with the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test and then confirmed with the Levene test for = 3, were performed. T he level of significance was set at P < 0.05 for all analyses. All data were analyzed using the program Statistica\u00ae 10.0 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, expressed for organisms from treatments T1 (44), T2 (41) and T3 (36) were significantly higher ( P < 0.05) than organisms at T o and all control groups (16 -34) (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION This study revealed that homeopathic treat ment potential from immune system (Bellavite et al., 2006, 2014b; Bel l & 2015). in treatments phosphoric have been observed 72 Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research Figure 5. a) Survival and b) Argopecten juveniles - Su\u00e1stegui et be in tissues had an open circulatory system (Beninger & Le Pennec, 2006), and some authors have found differences at hemocytes count only in tissue and not in hemolymph (Cochennec -Laureau et al., 2003). We propose to measure count highly showed the high counts which were one to three times higher than controls (C3, C2, and C1). Increases of hemocytes higher compared c ontrols related -Alvarez et al ., 2015). The increase in hemocyte count has been considered as an indicator of the activation of the immune system response since they are the main cellular effectors and act as defense mechanism s in bivalves (Canesi et al., 2002; Song et al., 2010). The fact that homeopathic treatment formulated by pathogenic bacteria allowed an increase in the haemocyte count could supported and the recognitions of specific epitopes, which are the part of the recognized by the immune system. Increase in hemocyte immune system (Song et al Wang et et al ., 2017) nanoparticles as from been detected (Chikramane et ., 2012; & Schwartz, 2015) . Homeopathy effect has been attributed to a response of a low silent al., 2010; (Balseiro et study of the homeopathic drug formulated by pathogenic can response. It must be noticed that application of homeopathic treatment formulated by bacteria, which are un -expensive and may imply a complex diversity of high diluted epitopes, had never evaluated in reported by Ortiz -Cornejo et al. (2017) , and it is believed that these treatments could worked by in scavenging free radicals when used at 1, 5, 10 and 50 \u00b5M concentrations (Kim et al., 2013) , a concentration close to 1D dilution. In rats, the addition of sodium because physiological immune re sponse (Nielsen, 2008) , while the intake of phosphoric acid has been associated to an increase of phosphorus in the organisms (Caravati, concentrations can promote decalcification and decrease growth (Calvo & Tucker, 2013), but it can improve health in moderate concentration. In hybrid sturgeons, the 2012). In homeopathic concentrations, phosphoric acid has been related Cuba) has hemocyte a hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation in culture mouse cells. Thus, be carefully because these authors used the commercial a hydroalcoholic solution (30\u00b0GL), and carcinom a proliferation could be an effect of the alcohol itself. It has been reported that ethanol can suppress and decrease cytokines (Pruett avoid undes irable effects of ethanol, and activity. The former supports the of the The SOD and CAT ivities occurred as a response to overcome oxidative way pathogen infection (Vlahogianni et al., 2007 ; Song et al., 2010). SOD and CAT can transform cytotoxic c ompounds harmful for the cells such as water and oxygen (Song et al., 2010). In this study, treatments from pathogenic bacteria and sodium metasilicate -phosphori c acid showed a notorious activation of the antioxidant system (around the 300 - 500% of CAT activity in the mantle and about the 160% of SOD in digestive gland compared to controls). These treatments have been associated with antioxidant system activation a t homeopathic and non -homeopathic solutions. Increases of CAT and SOD in digestive gland (around 600 and 250%, respectively) activities an (Prego - Faraldo et al ., 2017) and presence of bacterial compounds (Song et al ., 20 10; Wang et al 2013) . Particularly CAT activity has demonstrated to (Li et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013), and heat k illed pathogenic bacteria, such as V. splendidus galloprovincialis which registered between 58 98% of CAT activity compared to the control (Canesi et al ., 2010) . In mouse brain from organisms intoxicated with aluminum, an increase in transcription of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT have been reported when at 0.9% was administered to mice -Mu\u00f1oz al., 2008) . Evidence has been reported that proves the presence of silicic acid in homeopathic 10% in SOD when A. ventricosus juveniles were treated immune at the cellular level and the antio - xidant system of the Catarina scallop juveniles. 74 Latin American Journal of Aquatic Research The commercial homeopathic treatments from Silicea terra and Phosphoric acid (Similia\u00ae) show a effect tissues (muscle and digestive gland) have been reported as the principal storage organs of energetics reserv es (Barber & Blake, 2006) . Protein levels depletion (around 12 to 41%) in all experimental groups was related to overall nutrition conditions in the of protein other reserves like carbohydrates and al As treatments the same diet, an increase of reserves by Silicea terra and phosphoric acid (Similia\u00ae) could be with an enhancement in food assimilation processes. Homeopathic Silicea terra has been A. ventr icosus (Maz\u00f3n et silicon dioxide vannamei. In the case of phosphoric activity of by Silicea terra and phosphoric may cause a depletion of energy reserves (Genard et al., 2013). The DGI and SmMI did not show a specific effect by treatment, but StMI was higher in with promote better assimilation. It should be noticed that muscle is main carbohydrates reserves scallops the diets and conditions were conditions, treatment effect. A relation - ship was observed growth length and the homeopathic treatments formulated by rate and playing transport to shell reg eneration (K\u00e1d\u00e1r, 2008). Haemocytes count has been associated with induction to shell repair (Mount et al ., 2004) . This finding makes suppose that hemocytes have to formation and could be helping to increase shell calcification and growth as in condition index were minimal differences between most of the treatments; studies tissues. treatments are a good alternative to activate the immune system at the cellular level and the antioxidant system because of their easiness for preparation, storage, and administration. Homeopathy for aquaculture is a novel and eco -friendly prophylactic option to improve the overall condition juveniles at the pre -fattening stage.
