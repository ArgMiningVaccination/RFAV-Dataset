The future neurodevelopmental medicine has the potential of situating child neurology at the forefront public health effort to optimize of and peri-natal, and environmental early development and leading lifetime disabilities. Building on advancements in developmental social neuroscience and in implementation science, this shift is occurring in the case of emblematic neurodevelopmental disorders Capitalizing on quantification of trajectories of social-communicative development, new technologies are emerging for high-throughput and cost-effective diagnosis and delivery. These solutions could be deployed in the case of other groups of children at greater risk for autism and communication delays, such as those born extremely premature or heart disease.
