People exposed to air toxics at higher concentrations and over time may have an increased chance of getting cancer or experiencing other serious health effects. These health effects can include damage to the respiratory, and exposed to air toxics by: - Breathing contaminated air fish from contaminated waters; meat, milk, or eggs from animals that fed on contaminated plants; and vegetables because they can ingest soil from their hands or from objects they place in their mouths) - Making skin contact with contaminated soil, dust, or trucks other stationary (business volcanoes and wildfires. Health Risk [When we talk about health risk, we mean the probability, or chance, that exposure to a hazardous substance will you sick. cancer Our exposure to substances increase our chance of developing these illnesses \u2014 meaning we are more likely to develop them than someone who has not been exposed.](/health-risk-infographic/) Scientists estimate the health risk by looking at: - How hazardous the substance is, based on health studies; and - How much of the substance people are being exposed to. Risk assessment is what we call this process of estimating risk. In addition to looking at the amount and toxicity of the substance, risk assessments also other factors, including: - Weather conditions - Distance from the source of the substance to people - The age, health, and lifestyle of people living or working near the source of the substance - The amount of time people have been exposed to the toxic substance It's important to note that numbers provided by health risk assessments (known as HRAs) do not refer to actual cases of health problems that will occur from exposure to air toxics. The risk assessments are computer calculations that are a tool to identify and reduce possible negative health effects. to air toxic. It's expressed as a probability: the number of additional people that may get cancer in a group of one million people. Non-cancer health risks can include as damage to organs, the central nervous system, or reproductive functions, and developmental problems in children. Non-cancer health risk is expressed as a \"Hazard Index\" (known as an HI). The HI compares the increased health risk from exposure to the air toxic to an exposure level that is considered acceptable by public health professionals. For example, a Hazard Index of 2 means the concentration of toxics in the air at the point of exposure is predicted to be twice as high as is generally thought to be safe. Reducing Health Risk from Air Toxics [State and federal regulations are designed to control exposure to air toxics, and reduce the health risk. For more information, see ](/what-are-we-doing-about-health-risk-from-air-toxics-infographic/) [Air Toxics Regulations](/air-toxics-regulations/). In Santa Barbara County, the implementing the California affected facilities, the the District, determine air toxic emissions. Facilities that release considerable amounts of toxic air pollutants are required to perform a risk assessment to estimate public health risks associated with these emissions. and required facilities that pose a significant risk. The current thresholds that define a significant risk from air toxics in Santa Barbara County, set and approved by the District's Board of Directors, are: for cancer risk, a risk of equal to or greater than 10 in a million; and for non-cancer acute and chronic risk, a hazard index greater than 1. Significant Risk Facilities A significant risk facility is a facility operation that releases toxic substances into the air that pose health risks at levels that exceed the District's thresholds. Currently, there are no significant risk facilities in Santa Barbara County. Over time, the District has worked with facilities to reduce their risk to below the significance thresholds. Since 1991, the number of significant risk facilities in Santa Barbara County has been reduced by 100 percent. In 1991 there were 51 significant risk facilities and now there are zero. In addition evaluating existing facilities in AB 2588, the facilities permit process when issuing Construct permits. The goal for the District's new source review health risk program is to prevent a new or modified facility from creating significance criteria established by the AB 2588 program). With this program, no additional significant risk facilities have been created since 1991.
