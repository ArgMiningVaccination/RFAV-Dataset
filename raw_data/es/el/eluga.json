However, in order to guarantee safe use of medicinal plants, it is necessary to quantify their content of heavy metals. In Mexico there is little information regarding content of toxic elements in medicinal plants, and these are consumed directly without a prior analysis of heavy metals. In this study, concentration of two toxic elements: cadmiom and lead (Cd and Pb) and a three different locations in two municipali - ties in the Huasteca Potosina, Mexico. Cd and Pb are two toxic elements with no biological function, and can cause severe damage when introduced into food chain, whereas iron is an essential element. However, iron is a major element that can form oxides and en - trap trace elements such these elements in plants. Also, in the Huasteca Potosina, the three medicinal plants of this study are used for empirical treatment of iron deficiency. Therefore, it was important to study concentration of the three elements in these medicinal plants. Results of this analysis showed that 50% and 22% of herbal preparations contain higher respectively. In addition, the three medicinal plants could be an important source of Fe. Results suggest that collection of medicinal plants should be carried out in sites free of potentially dangerous toxic elements. RESUMEN Recientemente, el uso de plantas medicinales en M\u00e9xico y en todo el mundo se ha incremen - tado. Sin embargo, con el fin de garantizar el uso seguro en de las plantas medicinales, es necesario cuantificar su contenido de metales pesados. En M\u00e9xico existe poca informaci\u00f3n sobre el contenido de elementos t\u00f3xicos en las plantas medicinales, y estas son consumidas directamente sin realizar un an\u00e1lisis previo de metales pesados. En este estudio se cuantific\u00f3 la concentraci\u00f3n de dos elementos t\u00f3xicos: cadmio y plomo (Cd y Pb) y de un micronutriente: fierro (Fe), en tres plantas medicinales ( Arnica montana y Hamelia pantens ) colectadas de tres sitios diferentes de dos municipios de la Huasteca Potosina, M\u00e9xico. El Cd y Pb son dos elementos t\u00f3xicos sin ninguna funci\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica conocida, que pueden causar severos da\u00f1os al introducirse en la cadena alimenticia, mientras que el hierro es un elemen - to esencial. Sin embargo, el hierro es un elemento mayoritario que puede formar \u00f3xidos y atrapar elementos traza como el Pb y Cd, y favorecer la bioacumulaci\u00f3n de estos elementos en las plantas. Adem\u00e1s, en la Huasteca Potosina, las tres plantas medicinales en estudio son usadas para el tratamiento emp\u00edrico en la deficiencia de hierro. Por lo anterior, fue importante estudiar la concentraci\u00f3n de los tres elementos en ambas plantas medicinales. Los resultados de este an\u00e1lisis mostraron que el 50% y el 22% de los preparados de plantas medicinales contienen valores m\u00e1s altos que los considerados como seguros para Cd y Pb, respectivamente. Adem\u00e1s, se confirma que estas tres plantas medicinales podr\u00edan ser una fuente importante de Fe. Con esto se sugiere que la recolecci\u00f3n de plantas medicinales se debe realizar en sitios libres de elementos t\u00f3xicos potencialmente peligrosos. * Unidad Acad\u00e9mica Multidisciplinaria Zona Huasteca, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed.

Local flora an important source of traditional medicines that are used for various instance, 39 plant species belonging to 25 - cal families have been used for colon cancer treatment in Mexico with evidence in in vitro and in vivo stud - ies (L\u00f3pez-Rubalcava & Estrada-Camarena, 2016). In addition, 49 plants have been used in Mexican tradi - tional medicine for treatment of disorders related to anxiety and depression (Jacobo-Herrera et al., 2016), and more than 100 medicinal plants have been used as immunostimulants (Alonso-Castro, Ju\u00e1rez-V\u00e1zquez & Campos-Xolalpa, vendors herbal products, called \"yerbateros\", obtain medici - nal plants from the wild and perform their prescription to general population.

These factors along with harvesting Mgbeahuruike, heavy - potential might enter into food chain. in tissues disrupts function several enzymes (Rusyniak , Arnica montana and Hamelia pirical treatment of several diseases (Alonso-Castro et al., 2012). A general description, as well as medicinal and economic importance of these plants are listed in table 1. In this study, these three medicinal plants were collected in the municipalities of Tamazunchale and Ciudad Valles, located in the Huasteca Potosina (Mexico) (figure 1), which is a region located in the coast - al plain of the Gulf of Mexico. Some toxicological studies in terms of levels of heavy metals in water from rivers from the Huasteca Potosina have been carried out. For instance, Wong-Arg\u00fcelles (2009) determined that levels of Cd and Pb in water from rivers of Huasteca Potosina , including rivers from the municipalities of Ciudad Valles and Tamazunchale (figure 1), were below than those allowed by Mej\u00eda-Saavedra & D\u00edaz-Barriga (2008) reported that As levels in a river from the municipality of Tamazunchale were higher than those allowed by Mexican Legislation for D\u00edaz-Barriga Cd, Pb, Hg, and As levels in sediments from the river in Tamazunchale were higher than those recommended by the Canadian Legislation for the pro - tection of wildlife (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment [CCEM], 2000). General population perceives medicinal plants as safe and with no toxic effects because of their natu - ral origin (Alonso-Castro et al., 2012). Content of con - taminants in medicinal plants should be analyzed and regulated by health systems worldwide to help qual - ity assessment of these products. Poisonings associ - ated with presence of toxic metals medicinal plants have been reported in some countries Tal necessary to regarding content plants used in Mexican traditional medicine. Nevertheless, in Mexico there is limited information in terms of toxic elements content in medicinal plants. The objective of this study was to collect three medicinal plants the Huasteca Potosina and analyze their Pb, Cd and Fe content. Figure 1.

The three plants were washed with tap water and then with deionized water to remove any adhering dust particles. Plant material was sectioned into stem and leaves, dried at 70 \u00b0C during 1 h, and grounded in a Wiley mill for 2 min. Additionally, infusions of J. spicigera , H. patens and A. montana were prepared, each, by add - ing 1 g of aerial parts into 1 l of boiling distilled water. Plant material was boiled for 5 min and cooled to room temperature for 10 min. This procedure was carried out according to traditional way medicinal plants in the Huasteca Potosina (Alonso- Castro et al., samples were preserved High-density polyethylene (HPDE) bottles at room tem - perature and protected from light and dust. Analyses of Cd, Pb and Fe were carried out by acid digestion with 0.1 mL HNO3 (reactive grade, Fermont) per 2 mg of plant material during 4 days. Acid digestion was per - formed at room temperature in closed Teflon vessels. In order to complete oxidation, acid diges - tion was continued during 24 h by adding 0.5 mL of H2O2 30% (v/v) (Alfaro-De La Torre, 1997; Yan, Mackie & Dillon, 1990).

Results were considered significantly different where the cal - culated P-values were 0.05. All calculations were TM V2.02 program. RESULTS Concentrations of Cd, Pb and Fe in raw material and their infusions are shown in figure 2. Findings indi - cated that the highest Cd concentration was found in leaves from A. montana collected in sites 1 (38 mg/kg \u00b1 2.3 mg/kg) and 3 (39.5 mg/kg \u00b1 2.1 mg/kg), whereas the lowest Cd concentration was found in H. patens leaves collected in site 2 (0.2 mg/kg \u00b1 0.01 mg/kg) (figure 2A). Safe limit for Cd is 0.3 mg/kg in plant ma - terial final dosage (World Health Organization [WHO], 1999). Taking this account, following prepa can considered as safe: leaves infusion of H. patens and A. montana , each from the 3 sites of collection, J. spicigera infusion from sites 2 and 3, J. spicigera leaves from site 2, and J. spicigera stem from site 3. In contrast, concentration of Pb in all medicinal plants ranged from 283.3 mg/kg ( J. spicigera leaves from site 1) to 2.1 mg/kg ( A. montana infusion from site 2) (figure 2B). Permissible limit for Pb is 10 mg/ kg set by the WHO (1999). Considering this value, only J. spicigera leaves and stem, from all 3 sites of collection could not be considered as safe for human because it exceeds permissible limits of heavy metals in herbal products (Food and Agriculture Organiza - tion [FAO] / World Health Organization [WHO], 1984; WHO, 1998, 2004, 2007, 2011; Zhang 1998). Pb and Cd are toxic pollutants that affect human health (Khan et al., 2014). Pb can cause anemia, neurological dis - orders, (Marsden, system, kid - neys, and bones (Godt et al., 2006). In this study, concentrations of Pb in J. spicigera were higher than In addition, concentrations of Pb and Cd in the three medicinal plants were higher than those reported by Sadhu in medicinal plants collected from ISSN 0188-6266 Vol. 26 No. 5 Septiembre-Octubre 2016 28 Quantitation of Cd, Pb and Fe in three medicinal Alonso- Castro, Juan Jos\u00e9 Maldonado-Miranda, Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez Morales | pp. 24-30India. Iron (Fe) is an essential element for plants Mishra, 2010; Yi & 1996). Concentrations of Fe found in this study ranged from 6.3 mg/kg ( J. spicigera in- fusion at site 1) to 295 mg/kg ( H. patens leaves at site 3) (figure 2C). It is considered that content of Fe in plant tissue ranges from 50 mg/kg - 300 mg/kg (in terms of dry weight). Results suggest that these three concentration of Fe, which corroborates spicigera and H. patens , each, for empirical treatment of anemia (Alonso-Castro et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it has been reported that plants exposed to Cd contamination de - creases their uptake of Fe (Baryla et al., 2001; Sikka & Nayyar, 2012). In this study, content of Cd found in medicinal plants did not alter their concentration of Fe. It is probable that consuming herbal drugs obtained from polluted sources will lead - ards, especially if this results in exposure to Cd (Mishra, Dwivedi 2010). in activities, elements have released in environ - ment and their concentrations have increased (Alloway, 1995). Worldwide, many areas used for agricultural pur - poses are contaminated with heavy metals (Nagajyoti, Lee uptake from the soil, water or air. Heavy metals may enter into food chain through ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which are (Oskarsson, Jorhem, Sundberg, Nilsson beings might be intoxicated with heavy metals by direct con sumption of medicinal plants contaminated with these elements. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate pres - ence of toxic elements such as Cd and Pb in medici - nal plants in order to provide their safe use. Heavy metal concentrations were determined in raw material (stem and leaves) and in infusions of aerial parts of J. spicigera , A. montana and H. pantens because these are plant parts and a way of administration commonly used in Mexican traditional medicine. Accumulation of heavy metals in the three medici - nal plants tend to vary depending on site of collection and on the medicinal plant. The highest concentra - tions of Cd were found in site A, whereas the high-est concentrations of Pb were found in sites and plants have developed in metals such as Cd and Pb (Khan et al., 2015). In Fe case, there was not found a clear pattern of in medicinal plants was found in site 2. Variations regarding accumulation of heavy metals in medicinal plants may be due to some factors such as mineral composition of soil, total concentra - dissolved in each sampling site, and mecha - of (Sadhu al., 2015). For instance, Pb low transfer coefficients, remains stably and shows minimum bioavailability to plants. In contrast, met - als like Cd have higher transfer coefficients and are eas - ily taken plant 2004). CONCLUSION In this study indicates that detection of toxic elements, such Cd and in collected. Also, it is necessary implement a threat for hu - man health. Thus, collection of medicinal plants should be done in monitored sites which are free of contamina - tion. This study also gives information for conducting other studies in different parts of Mexico for quantifica - tion of toxic metals in medicinal plants.
