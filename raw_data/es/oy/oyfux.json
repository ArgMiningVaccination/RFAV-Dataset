These antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, from companies including in on tumours and then release cytotoxins that deliver up to 10,000 times the potency of standard chemotherapy, while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. The approach has for decades been a major biotech industry focus. Many experimental ADCs, however, failed due to the complexity of pairing the right antibody with the appropriate toxic agent. Some were abandoned as too weak; others were too harmful. From 2000 to 2018, only five ADCs won approval. Just one, Roche's has surpassed billion in annual it boosted disease-free survival for some patients Herceptin. Over time, scientists devised better and antibodies more precisely reach tumours. There is a growing understanding, too, of how to design ADCs to kill \"What the benefits of the science becoming mature,\" said ADC pioneer Chris Martin, CEO of Switzerland's ADC Therapeutics. \"It took at least a decade, probably more like 15 years, to really begin to turn the art into a science.\" In 2019, U.S. regulators approved three ADCs, the most ever in who had failed immunotherapy showed improvement, and in some cases, no evidence of cancer, when they were assessed after treatment. Roche's Polivy was against lymphoma in June after producing complete response rates, with no signs of disease, in 40% of patients when combined with two other therapies. NEW RECORD While all three drugs must prove their mettle in further studies, the industry is growing optimistic that ADCs' time may have arrived. The drug include its belantamab mafodotin against multiple in the last six months, of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's to review its ADC against triple-negative breast cancer, which is hard to treat and has poor prognosis. Massachusetts-based ImmunoGen, hit by past trial failures, got a lift in December for its ADC against ovarian cancer when the FDA indicated it may become a candidate for accelerated approval. The surge in ADC investment has been fuelled, in part, by improvements in the so-called \"linker\" binds the antibody its keeping them stable in the circulatory system until the poison can be unleashed on the targeted tumour. ADCs are generally delivered via repeated chemotherapy. \"There is a revival again because there is a new generation of molecules in which the linker is more efficient,\" Giuseppe Curigliano, clinical director of European of Oncology, has like Merck KGaA and Lonza ramping up facilities, in hopes drugmakers will farm out complex ADC production. Merck expects the overall ADC market to grow by more than 20% in coming years, boosting its business, which includes manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies, linkers and cytotoxic agents. Roche's two ADCs and sees annual 9% growth the so-called bioconjugates market, is investing millions of dollars in its site, where it produces ADCs for other drugmakers. \"What we see over time at Lonza is a good request for capacity,\" said Iwan Bertholjotti, Lonza's bioconjugate commercial development head. good that the market is booming.\" (GRAPHIC: Global ADC clinical pipeline - ) (GRAPHIC: ADC development - ) Still, enthusiasm is not universal. AbbVie in August abandoned its ADC candidate Rova-T after flunking a lung cancer trial and wrote off most of $5.8 billion it paid for the drug's developer, Kadcyla and Polivy, has also backed off. In 2013, the Basel-based company had about a dozen experimental ADCs. Today, only one remains, and it is being developed for Staph infections, not cancer.

In March, the Cambridge, England-based struck a $7 tumour potential.\" Reporting Burger in Frankfurt and John Miller in Zurich; Editing by "}
