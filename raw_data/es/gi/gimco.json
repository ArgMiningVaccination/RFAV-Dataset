People may delay or refuse vaccination due to lack of confidence in recommended vaccines and providers, complacency shaped by context (e.g., distance to health services, culture, or history), and individual and vaccine-specific factors.

Evidence on determinants of vaccine hesitancy informal settlements (\"compounds\") in Lusaka, Zambia. This qualitative study was nested within a larger study on the uptake of 2-dose oral cholera vaccine (OCV) in these compounds. Approximately 1.2 million people living in Lusaka compounds are at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases due to unsanitary in December 2016.

The researchers conducted a rapid qualitative assessment that included 48 focus group discussions (FGDs) with residents and community-based health actors (HCWs), vaccinators, health 281 laypersons and community-based participated and two doses, at 28% each. The majority of the participants had children (64%), and most (93%) of those with children said they would agree to vaccinate them. Responses from health actors were very much in tune with those in the community, likely because they are from the community and expressed high or delay getting vaccinated (see Tables 2 4 the for themes and sub-themes related to acceptability and cases young men using beer, spirits and local alcohol, Tujilijili, Junta, and Kachasu, while others used other informal and traditional alternatives such traditional for example, \"God did not take any medicine\" - and was associated with Satan. In particular, HCWs described some churches that promoted faith healing over modern medicine. Use of prayer and traditional remedies could be fuelled by distrust of modern medicine, which is still perceived as \"white\" or \"western\"; this distrust finds its roots in colonial history of exploitation and appropriation.
