His rst publication on Spanish colonial law, Introducci\u00f3n al estudio del derecho Indiano (1916), can largely be viewed as a foundational wo rk for in with subsequent that further elaborate on this topic (e. g. Le-vene 1918, 1924). Between the late 1930s and 1940s, other scholars, like Rafael Altamira (Altamira 1938, 1939, 1948), Jorge Basadre (1937), Ots Cap-dequi (1943), and Manuel Belaunde Guinassi (1947), took it upon them- selves to build on the notion of derecho indiano and in general on Levene's work, which itself had been in fluenced by his own teachers and developed in close other jurists and (Levene 1953; Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui 1990, 2006). From the 1950s on, Alfonso Garc\u00eda-Gallo of Spain emerged as the leading scholar in the eld (Garc\u00eda-Gallo 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955). For the next three decades, his writings would set the agenda for legal historical studies on the overseas terr itories of the Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, Garc\u00eda-Gallo founded the Instituto Internacional de la Historia del Derecho Indiano (IIHDI) in 1966. With his keynote address entitled Problemas metodol\u00f3gicos de la historia del derecho indiano (Garc\u00eda-Gallo, 1967), held at the rst interna- tional meeting of legal historians working on the derecho indiano , he set the agenda for further research. In his subsequent works, he presented impor- tant key topics concerning derecho indiano (Garc\u00eda-Gallo 1970, 1972, 1987). In this regard, the manifold contributions of scholars from both sides of the Atlantic cannot be empha-sized enough, for it is no exaggeration to state that for more than two decades, both Latin American and Spanish scholarship relied on the episte-mic framework delineated by Garc\u00eda-Gallo, to which leading scholars of the subsequent generation, like Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui (1993), Martir\u00e9 (1996), and Introduction: New Horizons of Derecho Indiano 1S\u00e1nchez Bella (1996), testify. Moreover, since its foundation, the IIHDI has been organizing a series of congresses at locations alternating between Spain and Latin America. This has helped to build a transnational scholarly com- munity a forum for debates and scholarly exchanges. The published acta of the IIHDI conferences provide an excellent window to the state of the research within the eld between the 1970s and the 1990s ( D el aH e r ae ta l . ,1 9 8 9 ) .1 Nearly thirty years later, in 1995, the 11thCongress of the same Institute, held in Buenos Aires, heralded the revival of the discipline, when the Argen-tinian legal historian, V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui, seized the opportunity to address questions on methodology and on the future orientations of the discipline. In so doing, he also invoked the writings of European legal historians like Paolo Grossi, Antonio Manuel Hespanha, Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero, and others. At the same time, he drew on his own intense legal historical research carried out in the previous decades, starting with research on the codication of civil law in Argentina (Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui 1977) and working his way through to the foundational structures of derecho indiano (Tau refl 1993, 1996). His inaugural lecture at the 11thCongress, which was published in 1997 under the title Nuevos Horizontes en el Estudio Hist\u00f3rico del Derecho Indiano (Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui 1997), can be considered part of a broader tendency to revisit and re flect upon the early scholarship on derecho indiano undertaken by the rst two generations of legal historians from Latin America and Europe, especially from Spain, that generated compre-hensive bibliographical studies in the 1980s and the 1990s. 2 At the outset, Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui proposes going beyond conceiving the paradigm of legal history purely as a history of legal norms. He rst describes theMethodenstreit of the 1970s, which had considerable in fluence on how legal history - and Spanish colonial law - was understood, in that either 1 For a list of the Congresses with a complete digital library of all the publications of the Congress see: http://web.ua.es/es/institutoderechoindiano/. 2 Outstanding in this context is D agrossa (1998); see also B ernal G\u00f3mez auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1996); Bec\u00fa (1995), (1997). 2 Thomas Duve, Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kis o m es c h o l a r se m p h a s i z e dt h ec h a r a c t e ro ft h ed i s c i p l i n ea sal e g a ls c i e n c e (Garc\u00eda-Gallo, Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa), while others, mainly Spanish scholars, such as Francisco Tom\u00e1s y Valiente and Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero, chose to situate legal history within a social science frame work. Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui now linked the methodological development of legal history to what he called \"the posture superseding rational and statutory state law, \" 3so as it was now being conceived by scholars, related more to the autonomy of di fferent levels organization, di fferent modes of normative creativity, diverse notions of law and justice, the jurist's position as an artifact of law, and the casuistic character of legal decisions. All of these, according to Tau Anzo\u00e1-tegui, were now to be seen as alternatives to the old conception of law as a matter of state hegemony. This changed conception of modern law opened up new horizons for legal historians and scholars of Spanish colonial law, aiding them to broaden their understanding of the Anzo\u00e1tegui also led him to make an appeal to the legal historians to use a broader array of sources in the study of legal norms than just the textual sources.

Provincial and local derecho indiano had received scant scholarly attention, so that even a \"microhistory\" was well within the scope of the endeavor. And last but not least, Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui wished to see more scholarship on the and ruptures\" of colo-nial legal legacy in the nineteenth century, in the a ftermath of the colonial period. 6 Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's \"new horizons\" were thus wide open: even if he had not envisaged a comprehensive revolution of the eld, his program paved the way for revising the history of Spanish colonial law in order to gain a radically new understanding of it. While his positions were far from radical as far as historical scholarship was concerned, within the mainstream Latin American legal history and derecho indiano , his voice was authoritative. There is no doubt that areas of research in many elds that Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui iden- tied as However, globalization are felt both in historical and the legal sciences, and thus, unsurprisingly, also in the eld of legal history. Broader issues have experienced resurgence as of a direct result of that. They have raised awareness of the need to reconceive the circulation and juridical practices, and reiterated the signi cance of drawing attention to the layers of cultural translation that these ideas underwent in the process of reinterpretation in di fferent contexts.

How do we analyze the entanglements in legal history? Even if the answer may at rst glance seem rather easy, endless controversies have erupted tried to rede ne these pivotal terms. The aim of this volume is not to serve in the same capacity as Tau Anzo\u00e1- tegui's book from 1997, which essentially reoriented a (1997) it draws rich insights from Tau work in order to address some new challenges confronting the discipline. Not least, it hopes to help to integrate the study on derecho indiano into a broader eld, especially with research in the English-speaking world. It starts and ends with some considerations regarding historiography In- diano : Luigi Nuzzo's introduction re flects upon the of the historiog- raphy, and Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solo o ffers a dedication to Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's work. Richard Ross, Tamar Herzog and Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4ki present three studies, which integrate derecho indiano into an Atlantic perspective. Brian Owensby, Marta Lorente and V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui take up key aspects that Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui had raised in his Nuevos Horizontes . Together, the contributions, which were the result of a small workshop in Berlin, in June 2012, show that many of Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's wishes, which he expressed in Nuevos Horizontes in 1997, have indeed borne fruit. But even if considerable results have been achieved. It is equally clear that new demands are being placed on the study of derecho indiano . Some of the new questions have been treated in this volume, but much remains to be done. Twenty years aft er the 11thCongress of the IIHDI , where Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui presented his ections on Nuevos Horizontes , many of these challenges will have to be discussed on a global scale. If this volume helps to shed light on these New Horizons , its goal will have been achieved.

Ross Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other: Implications of the Missing Derecho Brit\u00e1nico Indiano Most of the essays in this volume, proceeding in the spirit of Victor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's distinguished scholarship, pursue \"new horizons\" in the study of American law. Co-editors Thomas Duve and Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4ki charged me with a di fferent mission. They asked me, a student of British North American law in an Atlantic framework, to compare the legal history of the Spanish and British empires with one eye on Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's work and the other on the papers produced for the volume. If there is a concept central to both Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's writings and to many of the essays in this volume, it is the derecho indiano -i t sm e a n i n g , implications, development, and variability, and the changing ways that scholars have understood it. From the perspective of the English Atlantic, what stands out is the lack of an analogous notion that refers to the collective legal order of the British North American colonies. 1Section I of this essay will explore why scholars of the English Atlantic do not think in terms of a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano . Its absence has powerfully shaped scholarship on the intellectual history of law (Section II) and on the trajectories of change perceived in the legal development of the two empires (Section III). I. Derecho Indiano and the (Missing) British American Continental Legal Order Historians of Spanish American law have put the concept of the \" derecho indiano \" at the center of their eld. This is true whether they treat the term restrictively as whether, more expansively, they include within the term, as Tau does, the 1 I will focus on the colonies that became the United States. Strictly speaking, the British Atlantic would have included English Canada and the English Caribbean. Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 9values and \"spirit\" of the law and the interactions with politics and the wider society that animated the juridical order. The ongoing learned debates over the nature and meaning of the derecho indiano have made the term highly contested, which has only underscored its importance as an object of study. Indeed, historians who go so far as to recast the derecho indiano less as a set of d o c t r i n e st h a na sa ni n t e l l e c t u a lc u l t u re, and who contend that its successes and failures owed less to its institutio nal framework to works and interests surrounding those institutions, nonetheless insist on its centrality as the starting point for discussing Spanish American law. Some of the papers in this conference - for instance, by Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solo, Luigi Nuzzo, and Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4ki - the third of re flection on these themes, if we consider Tau and his contempo- raries the second generation, and their predecessors such as Ricardo Levene and Rafael Altamira the rst generation. 2 Historians of British American law, looking upon all of this, are im- pressed by the sophistication and intensity of these debates. But even more, they are struck by the absence of a workable analogue in their world to the derecho indiano . When they discuss the legal orders of the British Atlantic, they think in terms of \"constitutions, \" distinguishing among three types. First, a mix of bills rights, statutes, longstanding institutions, and customs organized, Britain itself. Second, each colony in America developed its own constitution, resting its charter, supplemented by colonial statutes, customs, habits of wielding power. Third, an \"imperial constitution, built oversaw matters diplomatic affairs, coinage, and and foreign commerce. The Empire pro- vided a structure for review of colonial legislation by the Crown's Privy Council and for appeal of judgments by colonial supreme courts. With characteristic unclarity, imperial suggesting when colonies particular might array uzzo (2015); P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2015). 10 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sof the \"laws of England, \" and when colonial fourth: a collective legal order of the colonies of the English Atlantic, a derecho brit\u00e1- nico indiano . Is this concept seldom found in the writings of scholars of British America because they had no political or ideological reason to invent it? The formation of the notion of a Spanish American derecho indiano is instructive here. The concept, developed by Ricardo Levene, came into use among historians only in the middle third of the twentieth century. It allowed scholars to treat the law of the Spanish Indies from a cosmopolitan, pan-Hispanic perspective that escaped from the limitations of national his-toriography. To speak of a derecho indiano was to emphasize how the various Latin American nations shared a legal-cultural inheritance, an inheritance that their forebears need to deploy a legal historical concept to underscore the common heritage of the constituent parts of the United States since it was already a single nation rather than, as in Latin America, a grouping of independent countries created out of a once uni ed empire. Ideology and politics aside, the more signi cant reason why historians do not think in terms of a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano is that the historical record is not conducive. Suppose, as a thought experiment, we imagine what a hypo-thetical derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano would have looked like. Its features can be modeled, by analogy, on the Spanish American derecho indiano. The purpose of this thought experiment is not to argue that a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano actually existed in any meaningful sense and has been overlooked. Not until the closing stages of the colonial period do hints of one emerge. Rather, the point is, ultimately, to invite re flection on the implications of Spanish Amer- ican - but not British American - legal history being organized around the study of a collective continental legal order. 3G reene (1987) 67-68, that the work of Garc\u00eda-Gallo more than Levene's made \" derecho indiano \"t h e central concept for the eld. Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 11Aderecho brit\u00e1nico indiano would have included, rst, an array of institu- tions that recurred from colony to colony (akin to the audiencias ,cabildos , corregidores , and so forth that could be found in New Spain, Peru, and other areas). Second, this collective legal order of the English American colonies would have expressed through law a and polit-ical commitments spanning the continent. In the case of the Spanish Empire, these included, for instance, the representation of the king as a guarantor of justice to his vassals, a commitment to evangelization, and a disdain for representative assemblies. Third, the collective legal order would have had a branch of law for overseeing a uni ed religious establishment. Fourth, it would have included principles determining which situations w o u l db eg o v e r n e db yi n d i g e n o u sc u s t o m sa n dw h i c hb yf u s i o n so fi n d i g - enous and settler law. Fi ftha n d nally, a sizable corpus of law issued from the metropolis and governing day to day life in the colonies - something akin to what the Spanish Empire collected in the Recopilaci\u00f3n -w o u l dh a v e brought some unity to an English collective legal order. But in reality, as opposed to in our thought experiment, the di fferent English historians sometimes treat the law of each English colony as a singular entity (the law of Massachusetts, of Virginia, and so forth). Or, more commonly, they think in terms of regions, with some dispute about how to organize them. A typical division includes New England, the Middle Colo- nies or the Delaware Valley, the Chesapeake, the Deep South, and the Car-ibbean islands. To be sure, students of the Spanish American derecho indiano also assume regionalism - but of a di fferent sort. Peripheral settlements, they note, employed varieties of indiano learned than the versions that obtained in the cores of New Spain and Peru. The choice of law rules contained within to create norms that di ffered from place place. The geographical variation that was expected, even praised, within the derecho indiano did not call into question its primacy as the overall framework for Spanish American law.5 5Altamira (1945) 144-183; C 12 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sBy contrast, the regionalism of British American law was of a more profound character. Seventeenth century settlers came institutional structures and legal cultures. First, where the sixteenth century Spanish Empire imposed Castilian-governing institutions upon New Spain and Peru, the English Empire insisted on no comparable similarities among its various colonies. 6The mode of o fficials differed executive fficials and tribunal. The governor and council owed appointment variously to the king (in \"royal\" colonies as settlements (in \"proprietary\" colonies regionally contrast between Massachusetts (the dominant colony in New England) and Virginia (the leading colony in the Chesapeake). Committed Puritans led the settlement of Massachu-setts. Determined a more righteous and Christianized society, they insisted that the state and churches work together in guiding or driving people toward Church members alone voted in col- ony-wide elections in order to preserve control by the godly. Yet within the con nes of this religious mission, the colony strove for a communal and consensual model of annually elected their o fficials and participated widely in local o ffices. Massachusetts codi e di t sl a w sa n d provided decentralized tribunals at the county and town level, dispensing relatively nontechnical labor exercised legal authority as a result of their economic and social prominence. Virginia notables dispensed a style of justice more authoritarian than the colonial norm in order to govern an agitated population that was disproportionately young and male. 6Lang (1975) 221-222. Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 13The primary unit of government was the county rather than town (as in Massachusetts).

Virgi nia and the Southern and Caribbean colonies, but not Massachusetts, developed the distinctive policing apparatus slave accidentally beat slaves to colonies o ffered public support for the private recapture or killing of runaways; and restrictions were placed on the ability of whites and slaves to socialize trade other cen- tury the contrast Massachusetts and Virginia suggest a conclusion: The profound regionalism of British America appears far less as a set of variations within a shared legal order than does Spanish American regionalism, which grew up under the framework of the derecho indiano .T h e absence of a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano has shaped how scholars have pursued the legal history of the two empires. This is apparent in the study of the intellectual history of law. II. Intellectual History On occasion similar questions have driven the intellectual history of British and Spanish American law. Historians have explored both empires' justi - cations for indigenous peoples. And they have stressed the prominence of law as a political vocabulary for negotiating with imperial administrators. Yet for all this, signi cant differences stand out in how scholars have pursued the intellectual history of law in the two empires. First, in the mix of approaches to legal history, intellectual history occupies a more prominent place in Spanish American than in British Amer- ican historiography. This is, in part, the result of the much greater amount of intellectual \"raw material\" in Spanish America. Since so many key admin-istrators of the Empire were letrados ,t h e yl eftbehind much more high-level 7Konig (2008); N elson (2008) 3-79; T omlins (2010) 221-226, 267. 14 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sintellectual re flection on law than did their British counterparts, who were typically laymen. There was no counterpart in the British Empire to the great importance of neo-Thomist legal theory among churchmen and jurists, which inspired re flection on the intersection of eternal law, natural law, and positive law in both state and church . British Protestants, Romans of laws binding conscience subjected the o ffender to mortal sin or only to venial sin. Scholars seeking to write intellectual histories of Spanish Amer-ican law have much more to work with than British American historians. The absence of a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano helps account for a second difference. Intellectual histories of British law, particularly in century, organize ies of Spanish American law typically treat New World as a unit harboring than as a series In support of this proposition, consider some of the distinguished intellectual histories of Spanish American law produced by Tau and by participants in this volume. First, Tau has famously written on t h et r a n s i t i o ni nt h eS p a n i s hA m e r i c a nE m p i r ef r o map r e d o m i n a n t l yc a s u -istical style of legal reasoning towards essay extends Tau's Spanish American legal culture of conscience, simultaneously the means and end of casuistry.9Second, Tau and others have stressed the importance of natural law and the \"common good\" within Spanish assessing whether obedezco pero no cumplo \"[ \" Io b e y ,b u t do not comply\"].10Or one might argue that for all the legalistic rhetoric of the Spanish Empire, o fficials based their actions far more on natural T au(1992a) 59-126; T au(2001) 143.

In so doing, they adopted a continental perspective. to Spanish historiography, the legal-intellectual his- tory of British American casuistry and conscience, common good, and nat-ural law commonly follows regional lines from settlement through, roughly, t h em i d d l et h i r do ft h ee i g h t e e n t hc e n t u r y .T ob es u r e ,t h eb r o a d e s to u t l i n e s of these intellectual frameworks were similar in the various regions of the English Atlantic. But in the mid-level propositions, in the ways that settlers drew upon and applied these overall frameworks, the regions di ffered. Let us begin with the notion of the \"common good. \" Jacobean promoters of \"honor and glory\" t o settlers who pursued the common good of than their own producing ad ifferently in flected notion the common good, one linked to the reli- gious mission of the colony. Both Massachusetts and Virginia settlers thought about the common good in the Ciceronian idiom characteristic of early modern Europe, which implored citizens to identify their private good with the collective, shared good of their community. This framework recognized that since communities varied, so would the particular form of the common good that each pursued. 14The common good de ned by the leaders of Puritan Massachusetts would naturally diff er from that of slave- holding Virginia, from Quaker Pennsylvania, and from heterogeneous New York with its substantial Dutch population.

Roger Wil- liams, exiled out of Massachusetts to help found Rhode Island, famously drew the opposite conclusion and denied the right of the civil magistrates to pressure Christian believers whose conscience led them to minority views. William Penn, the organizer of Pennsylvania, synthesized the leading argu- ments in mid-seventeenth tury England and adjusted them new regional rather than continental nature of the legal-intellectual history of the British Empire before the middle third of the eighteenth century is a subset of - and further proof of - the absence of a common legal order, of a derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano . But by the mid-eighteenth century, pronounced regional variations be- gan to abate. Consider law. The law nature supplied arguments the di fferent colonies colonies drew on natural law 15 For examples of the former, see Mosse (1957) [Massachusetts]; [Pennsylvania]. For an example of the latter, see, e. g., M urphy (2001). 16 On which, see R oss(2012). 17 M (1957) 88-106, Y irush (2011) 12-13. Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 17to discern the obligations of conscience or to dene the common good in their differing communities.19B yt h em i d d l et h i r do ft h ee i g h t e e n t hc e n t u r y , these uses subsided while settlers resisting an intrusive British Empire increasingly drew on natural law as a resource against the Crown and impe-rial administrators. Colonists claimed that their natural right to migrate to America, enter upon its unimproved open lands, and political societies implied would allow and to claim the full protection of English common law against royal and proprietary e fforts to limit its applicability. In the decade of agitation leading to the American Revolution, controversialists included natural law among their arsenal of arguments. 20From the mid-eighteenth century onward, then, variations in the use and interpretation of natural law tracked more onto political factions (prerogative popular parties and Whig vs. Tory) than onto regions, as was the case in the seventeenth century. There was, in short, at least a partial convergence among regions in their treatment law. This convergence encouraged scholars to write legal-intellec-tual histories of the Revolutionary era less in regional frameworks than on a continental-wide scale (in the style of Spanish American legal-intellectual historiography). With this in might ask whether the term \"con-vergence\" meaningfully describes the overall direction of change in other aspects of British American legal culture, and in Spanish American law. III. Trajectories of Change in Spanish and British American Law The initially regional organization of the British American legal systems powerfully shapes the story that scholars tell about the transition of colonial law from the seventeenth to eighteenth century. The perceived trajectory of change diff ers signi cantly from that in Spanish America. Let us start with the latter. Historians of Spanish American law speak of how a framework established by roughly the 1570s underwent a or consolidation until, arguably, the 1750s. The derecho indiano in the center of this picture underwent, it is said, continual but incremental change. Tau's history of the relative shi ftfrom casuistical to 19 Adding to the complexity, flected understandings of See R oeber (2001). 20 B otein (1980); W right (1931) 13-99; Y irush (2011) 17, 138, 156, 223-258. 18 R i c h a r dJ .R o s ssystematic reasoning might be read in this vein. So, too, accounts of the greater professionalization of Spanish American law, with the multiplication of letrados as judges or as \"judicial advisors. \"21 The dominant narratives of change deployed by British American legal historians are more dynamic in that they feature a rupture, or a signi cant reorientation, of the colonial legal systems between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The most important of these stories is \"anglicization. \" This development has two parts. The rst concerns an alteration in dispute resolution and character of litigation. Few trained lawyers immigrated to seventeenth century America. The colonial court systems were overwhelm-ingly staffed not by legal professionals but by laymen the substance of disputes and dispensed with intricacies of English its of this face-to-face community, population growth and dispersion and the expansion of and credit determined to fracturing relationships. Commercialization, especially more lawyerly and formal legal system, one more attentive to English and procedures. simplicity and accessibility of colonial justice. The colonial legal system became more like England's, became more \"anglicized, \" as it moved from a \"communal, informal mode of resolving disputes to a rationalized, au(1992b); Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa( 1 9 9 4 )4 6 22 B otein (1981); D ayton osen (1992). Although these inter- Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 19The British colonies \"anglicized\" in a second way in that their intensely regional legal cultures lost some of their distinctiveness and converged towards the legal order of England. The Puritan commitments of New England, the Quaker experiment in Pennsylvania, the Dutch heritage and the Stuart monarchs' absolutist initiatives in New York, and the Catholic presence in Maryland faded in the eighteenth century, losing to divide the regions of eighteenth century British North America, increasing imperial oversight of colonial lawmaking and judicature these mechanisms the Empire recon gured colonial judiciaries suppressed practices that were too puritan, Quaker or Dutch or that interfered with imperial control of trade and the royal prerogati ve. This partial convergence of region- al legal orders was part of a larger North American anglicization noticeable in the formation of a deeper, more self-conscious British identity and the growing resemblance structures, and across transformations captured by the rubric of \"angli- cization\" to the incremental changes of the derecho indiano in the mature Spanish American Empire suggests two (somewhat speculative) hypotheses - one brief, and one more extensive. To begin with, might we suppose that the eighteenth-century colonies not other and Empire by developing certain features of legal order, analogue to related processes have been taken as of the \"anglicization\" of colonial law, im- portant elements of them have been organized under rubrics, such as legal \"modernization. \" On the latter, see the debate between P riest (2001), and M ann (2002), and Priest's reply, ibid., 23 On the colonies' legal orders, see R oss(2008). 20 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sthederecho indiano ?

Although no derecho brit\u00e1nico indiano existed on the eve of the American Revolution, were there intimations of one?24 I will develop my second (speculative) hypothesis at greater length. British American anglicization is about the reorientation of a legal order on account of powerful social population growth and transatlantic trade, and a newly intrusive English Empire. Was there an analogy in the Spanish Empire - a story about the recreation of a legal order under the pressure of profound demographic, political, and economic change? In search of this story, we should look not at the settler side of the derecho indiano (which featured consolidation and incremental change), but at the Indian side. The Spanish Empire famously used law and bureaucracy to regulate the lives of indigenous peoples - to calibrate their tribute and labor requirements, to gath er together Indians through to develop semi-autonomous governance under Spanish oversight in the republic of the Indios . Within this general framework, there were speci c ways in which the changing relationship of the derecho indiano 24 What I am suggesting is related to, but ultimately di fferent than, the convergence of the political cultures of the two empires in the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth century observed by historians. Venality creolization a larger degree of self-rule. Meanwhile, the more intrusive British Empire encouraged English settlers to learn how to lobby and manipu-late an imperial bureaucracy. As a result, the di fferences in British and Spanish American political culture narrowed. Elliott (2006) 378-379. By contrast, I have sketched out - really, speculated about - a (partial) convergence in the legal orders of the two empires. Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other refers to the transformation litigation in colonies, a move towards a more technical, lawyerly, and formal system, one more responsive to English precedents and procedures. Indige-nous communities in Spanish underwent a became and lawsuits in private land tribute and labor exactions, defend against the overreaching of o con flicts.25As Indians grew more knowledgeable about Spanish law, they began to import into their legal affairs and governance of their own communities Spanish procedures and and offi cials. One sees this in land used within communities, in con flicts among ethnic Andean reduce duties owed to notables. Indige- nous governadores and alcaldes mixed native usages with Spanish legalisms when they judged other Indians or conducted residencias for Indian o ffi- cials.26By the end of the seventeenth century, lawyers and witnesses into Spanish legal more familiar legalistic ter- minology. 27To look these developments comparatively that indigenous internalization of Spanish legal procedures and concepts, what technicalities by imperial fficials) dimension refashioning of settlers' legal culture as they became habituated to more lawyerly and formal English legal procedures and concepts). 25 K ellogg (1995) 13, 51; O (2008) 41-44, 127-128, 166-167; S tern (1993) 132-134. 27 K ellogg (1995) 13, 82. 28 T au(1997) 102. 22 R i c h a r dJ .R o s sSecond, anglicization alludes to a more \"English\" style of governance colonies. This involved the more hierarchical judiciaries, the elimination of Assembly appellate jurisdiction, and the of some customs judges, and English courts. By the latter seventeenth century, the Crown not began for vetting, which could lead editing or abrogation. Board of Trade sent questionnaires to the colonies asking about their laws and customs, a proactive way of beginning the process of inspection. As Spanish American h i s t o r i a n sh a v ed e t a i l e d ,o v e rt i m eC a s t i l ep r e s s e df o ram o r ei n t r u s i v eg o v -ernance of indigenous communities. This occurred in stages. From the mid- sixteenth century onward, the Empire drew on models of Spanish municipal government to impose cabildos with alcaldes and regidores on native com- munity units.29The imperial bureaucracy from the local corregidor through the Council of the Indies scrutinized indigenous customs and violated law, reason, or Christian Empire's screening process did only historical surveys in order to determine - and begin the triage of - native customs. 30By the latter eighteenth century, in o fficials answerable the these developments with an eye on the anglicization of British North American colonial governance reveals some intriguing similarities.

In other areas, such as New Spain, the Bourbon reforms do not appear to have made much di fference in the governance of Indian communities. G ibson (1966) 173. Spanish American and British American Law as Mirrors to Each Other 23locally generated distinctiveness of the legal cultures in the English colonie s and the convergence of those legal cultures toward each other and toward England. The strictures derecho indiano likewise pushed of the distinct indigenous legal cultures among the Yucatan Mayas, Andean peo- ples.

Indian hierarchical chains similarities throughout the Americas, as Indian officials traced the source of their power back to the Crown, as native judicature and and redress of grievances, then legal cultures of Nahua, Yucatan, and Andean communities began to look more like each other, and somewhat more like Castile, than they had at the time of conquest.

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy Most historians focused on the Americas have assumed the colonial status of Spanish America. With some exceptions, which will be mentioned through-out this paper, the period between the conquest and independence of Span-ish America is described as \"colonial\" and, thus, included in the long-term history of the phenomenon of colonialism in the world. 1Within this com- mon framework, there are di fferent interpretations of the nature of this colonial relationship, its degree of continuity with 19th-Century colonial experiences, or the relatively typical character of colonial societies in the Americas between the 16th and 18th Centuries. This is not the place to reconstruct the genealogy of this interpr etation of colonial Spanish America, even though there is no doubt about the role that post-colonial discourse has had and continues to have in its consolidation. 2In post-colonial discourse, the colonial nature is a heuristic tool in the hands of historians, a starting point for a historical study ultimately conceived as the deconstruction of discourses that mask and reproduce dynamics of power and control between European powers and colonized countries. 3 The starting point in this paper is di fferent. The colonial nature of the relationship between the so-called West Indies and the Crown of Castile is the subject of study, rather than an assumption. Our purpose is to try to offer, from legal history, a new reading of Spanish colonialism that could lead to a more accurate interpretation of Latin American history. To this end, it is worth re flecting on the historiographical categories we are using to de ne the \"political\" status of American territories under the Spanish 1 A typical example of the assumption of this \"colonial paradigm\" is the title of the well- documented work by W oseber (2003). The author does not explain why she uses the phrase \"Colonial Domination\" as the title for her work. Its appropriateness is taken for granted. 2 For the formation of post-colonialism and its di fferent projections, see Y oung (2001). 3 In this sense the question is revisited.

Levene's proposal: Las Indias no eran Colonias Sixty years have elapsed since Ricardo Levene contested the treatment of colonies which historiography gave - and continues to give - to the Spanish dominions in the Americas during the Modern Age. 4The publication of the Argentine historian's theses, condensed into the title of his work Las Indias no eran Colonias , gave end to a series of actions promoted by Levene that w e r ef a v o r a b l yr e c e i v e db yt h eA r g e n t i n eN a t i o n a lA c a d e m yo fH i s t o r yf o r therst time in 1948.

The conclusions of the rst session included the assertion that Spain had conducted \"a colonization process\" in the Americas but it had \"not subjected the Spanish American regions under its rule to a regime of exploitation; rather, it gave them a legal personality, and in such legal order the absence of the term colony is evident. \" Ibid., 159. 10 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 80-92. As stated by Tau, there was active participation in the debate by the most prominent specialists of the time - with di fferent political views -, such as Ots Capdequ\u00ed, Rafael Altamira, Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo, Mario G\u00f3ngora, Richard Konetzke or Demetrio Ramos. Even though there was general consensus with the theses supported by Argentine Academy, believed it was correct to speak of colonies, in the classical sense of the term, as a result of the action of populating, even if the territories between Peninsu- 32 Rafael D.

The debate about whether it was appropriate to use the word \"colony\" was not understood then purely nominal explicitly, for many participants the subject of debate was not so much the place occupied by the Spanish American territories under the Spanish Monarchy but the role played by \"Spain\" in the Americas. The result of such dispute, which seems related to the one involving other actors in the 18th Century, 11appeared fraught with political consequences on both sides of the Atlantic. What was at stake in Argentina and in other countries in the Americas was the prominent role that the Hispanic world should play in dening the Nations in the Americas. Levene recognized this clearly in the preface to his work of 1951 by stating that the \"history of the Americas begins with that of Spain, our spiritual ascent and whose roots connect us with the remote origins of civilization. \" 12In this regard, the Argentine to which the Americas connected with \"civ- ilization\" (which could only be European), but also linked the debate about the nature of colonial Spanish domination directly to their present, because ultimately the Americas had their spiritual origin and roots in Spain.

Those were the early years of the Francoist State. The political context favored a nationalist reading of the history of the conquest and incorporation of the Indies into the Spanish Monarchy. 14However, this did not lead - as we have seen - to the outright condemnation of the term \"colony. \" From an analysis of the di fferent mean- ings that the to conclude that it be used to designate the Spanish American territories provided it was not used pejoratively, i. e., identifying it with the mere economic exploitation of the New World. 15Hence, it can be stated that the debate started by Levene was basically about the historical and cultural identity of Spanish American Nations and, at the same time, about the historical action of Spain in the Indies. In this sense, the starting point was patriotic essentialism: in Francoist Spain, in the most radical nationalist terms, even though (or perhaps because of it) what they tried to defend was the Old Empire; in Argentina, it was the defense of a Hispanic identity. On the other hand, though the participants in this rst debate were historians, in most cases the approach su ffered from a certain lack of atten- tion both to the historicity of the issue raised, as to the proper subject of study. In this regard, the image portrayed of the territorial status of the Indies under the the evolution of the relationship between the Crown and its dominions in the Americas over time dispensed with, but also the historicity of \"both subjects. \" Spain and the Americas were presented as compact entities with little historical evolution from the 16th to the 18th Century.

The \"timelessness\" of the adopted perspective in fluenced a deeper level, that of the assumptions underpinning the whole discourse. Thirdly, it is noteworthy that this academic debate had little signicance in both Anglo-Saxon and Latin historiographical production, despite the implications of its proposals. Indeed, it did not lead to the elimination of the concept of colony. At best, it hardly raised awareness of the semantic density of the concept and term uncritically. 2. Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa's contribution With the emergence of economic history in the analysis of Spanish Ameri- can reality, brought about by the Annales School, the word \"colony\" was undisputedly placed at the heart of studies on Spanish America. The debate initiated by Levene was largely set aside. From an economic standpoint, the binomial metropolis-colony off ered an interpretive framework that was tak- en for granted. 16In the few cases where this was noted, it was to con rm, without any reservation, the relevance of this framework of \"colonial\" understanding. 17 Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa made his contribution to in this new historio- graphical context. He believed that the problem of the \"constitutional sta-tus\" of the New World under the Spanish Monarchy was the most important problem of the Law of the Indies. However, not many authors had looked at 16 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 90-91.

Thus, from the very beginning, he established the limits within which he would analyze the problem. did not prevent work speci c issues he intended to resolve were the political status of the Indies in the Monarchy, the nature of their incorporation to Castile and the institutional consequences aim speci c historical period: The rst part dealt with the Indies as dominions of the Catholic Monarchs, and covered the pe riod between their discovery and the death of Ferdinand the Catholic (pages 61-79); the second part, entitled \"the Indies provinces of Castile, \" covered from the incorporation of the Indies to the establishment of the Bourbon dynasty (pages 80-133); the third part, \"The progressive centralization Monarchy, nished Bayonne and the entry of Napoleonic troops into the Peninsula (pages 134-143); and the fourth part focused on the crisis of the Monarchy (pages 144-161). As already established by historiography, Zorraqu\u00edn veri ed that the Indies had been joined to Castile in the form of an accessory union. In practice, this meant political, legal and economic dependence on the King-dom of Castile. 23Thus, there was Z summarized of the Indies on the Kingdom of Castile in eight points: They could not decide on the election, recognition or acceptance of the King; they did not have their own Courts as other kingdoms of the Monarchy; they were not in- 36 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9reztion into the Spanish Monarchy comparable to that of other kingdoms. Spanish America was subordinated to European politics and not vice versa. Nevertheless, Zorraqu\u00edn believed that the Indies could not be considered for two main reasons: Firstly, because Spanish American territories were not deprived of their own government and, in addition, a special with regard to the New World. The meaning given to this term, therefore, was the Roman Classical and, as such, it rarely appeared in the laws of the Indies. On account of the foregoing, Zorraqu\u00ed n considered that the Indies were in an intermediate situation: they were not totally subordinate to Castile, nor did they enjoy perfect autonomy, comparable to that of the kingdoms joined to the Spanish Monarchy. In the absence of a categorization in the language of pre-modern spoke of entities of the Cas-tilian administration, \" in the understanding that it was a territorial and self-regulating decentralization due to the high degree of self-government they attained, despite imposed centralism on the government by the Council of the Indies. To sum up his position, he wrote that \"there was self-regulation in the region as a whole with regard to Castile, centralism imposed by the Council on the New World, and decentralization if the existence of each of the major regions into which the Indies were divided was taken into account. \" 24 It follows from the paragraph titles of the Laws of 1681, that the Indies had developed from dominions to acquire the legal status of provinces. interpretation on the latter history - emphasizing the contrast between the achieved by Centuries and imposed on them since the volved in the government of the whole of the Monarchy nor were they incorporated into the common organs of the Empire; decisions regarding international treaties and wars, even if affecting the Americas, were made in Europe; the most signi cant decisions con- cerning the Law of the Indies were taken without participation of residents or local authorities; both the King and the most important organs of government of the Indies were located in Castile and were subject to Castilian in fluence; senior o fficers, both in the Court and in Spanish America were of peninsular origin; and nally, there was trade monopoly with Castile. 24 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa(1988) Monarchy 3718th Century. This policy ended with the crisis of the Monarchy and the creation of the new Nations a fter their independence. Hence, Zorraqu\u00edn's that the contemplation of the government system of the Indies as a whole revealed. On the one hand, he noted a clear dependence on Castile together with the existence of some territories vested with a certain political and legal personality. On the other hand, he spoke of centralization being apparent in judicial and governmental institutions in the Court, particularly the Coun- cil, along with undeniable autonomy of operation in Spanish America. In my opinion, one of Zorraqu\u00edn's greatest achievements was to perceive these contrasts. To this we must add, as Tau has pointed out, the adoption of a dynamic perspective materialized in the division into four historical peri- o d sa n d-f o l l o w i n gD e m e t r i oR a m o so nt h i s- 25the relevance given term to refer to the Spanish American territories.26 However, and without detracting from Zorraqu\u00edn's work of historical clarication, his use of Public Law categories coined in the 19th Century for the construction of the modern liberal state, such as centralization or decentralization, led to the concealment of key dimensions of the political structuring of the Indies under the Spanish Monarchy. Unconsciously, Zor-raqu\u00edn's of power was essentially alien to the legal culture that governed the formation and development of the Old Regime Monarchies. In this regard, but with more elegance, Tau has said that \"using modern notions, conceived by political theory for the contemporary State, to refer to the past [...] entails accepting the idea that the State - in this case the Monarchy - is created and organized top down projecting fundamental rules and actions on all levels, even the smallest and most remote. \" 27Therefore, Tau understands that this vision must be completed with one that assumes Spanish American diversity derived from geographical, temporal or spatial situation, and the existence of \"a plurality of small powers and jurisdictions that operate outside the 25 See R amos P\u00e9rez (1959) 36-39. For this author, the term \"Province\" in its fundamental meaning, connected tradition and post-independence history, could be plied to the whole Monarchy, all kingdoms being provinces at the same time. 26 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 97, 101-102 and 120. 27 Ibid. 113. 38 Rafael D.

And, even in the case of Garavaglia, the reference was aimed exclusively at Levene, and his tone was rather light and contemptuous. Nonetheless, the debate was not totally alien to the legal historical per- spective, even though other approaches prevailed, closer to the new political history or to economic history. Of particular relevance was the participation of Annick Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re 30in this debate and the responses that her work prompted from Carmen Bernand and Juan Carlos Garavaglia. The question Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re asked, and which guided her ability of the terms \"colony\" and \"colonial\" to adequately describe any phenomenon regarding the Spanish dominions in the Americas between the 16th and 19th Centuries. As this historian pointed out, this practice - introduced by exponents of European Enlightenment such as Raynal or Robertson - was broadly welcome in the independence speech. It was used to reject en masse the period of ownership by the Spanish Crown 28 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 113. 29 \"Para seguir con el debate en torno al colonialismo ..., \" Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, Debates (2004), http://nuevomundo.revues.org/430, posted 08/02/2005.

Quotations correspond to this America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 39and to lay the ideological foundations of the new Nations. Thus, Creole patriots, now of thought joined the anti-colonial critique of the last third of the 19th Century, which brought about a re-interpretation of the period of Spanish rule in the Americas as \" rst modern imperialism\" or caused such period to be set as the starting point of \"Euro-pean colonialism. \" Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re believes it is necessary to concepts in order to avoid anachronistic readings the past, of the Regime societies. From her perspective, it is inappro-priate to use the term colonization in a sense other than the traditional one - devoid of negative connotation - when referring to any time prior to the 19th Century. The French historian stresses the need for conceptualizing this period of American history by taking into account the space and time coor-dinates of the creation of these new political communities. Thus, and based on the social or sociological aspect o f the \"Kingdoms\" of the Indies, it is Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re's belief that it is possible to pret from a historical perspective - that is, one open to changes and muta-tions - a number of concepts from the or \"social return to this author's proposals since her thoughts may help us reconsider this new viewpoints. refere nce to it, by ism, to models that are useful to understand Spain's policy in the New World.

Garc\u00eda applied to the Iberian expansion into the New World, without prejudice to speci c characteristics America s during the Centuries of Spanish rule, both from the economic and political points of view. On the economic front, Garavaglia studied the constant economic flows from the colonies to the metropolis and the hard- labor jobs implemented extract historian highlights the contrast between the rights the King could have in territories such as Naples or Aragon - of a dynastic nature and with limited exercise due to the existence of certain institutions and pre-existent rights - from those he enjoyed in Spanish America as a result of the conquest of non-Christian pe oples. This is why, Garaviglia states, it was possible to impose certain rights on Spanish America that would have been unthinkable to impose on other territories the Monarchy. In this unequal context, any negotiation - in the cases where there was one - seemed conditioned by power politics. Not even the feeling of white Spanish American elites nurtured by the sense of belonging to the great Spanish Nation in the 18th Century could evolve from mere feeling, and, as such, was unable to deny the existence of a hi storical relationship of colonial subordination between the Americas and Spain. The Cadiz Parliament, with their mechanism for calling elections and their debate on the political rights of castes, evidenced once again that equality between both sides of the Atlantic was a chimera. 34 32 A similarly broad concept of the term \"colonial\" , although not expressly de ned, is the one employed, for example, by Benton (2002). 33 B ernand (2004). We cannot stop to consider the thorough development of the arguments put forward by Bernand, for which reason we refer the reader to the original text, and the same stands for Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re's work and for all the other papers we analyze herein. In her paper published in the Black Book of Colonialism, Bernand had argued that even though both tributes on the indigenous peoples as well as the transfer of a substantial portion of Brazil and Spanish America's wealth to the Iberian Peninsula were clear signs of colonial domination, Peru and New Spain were not colonies themselves, but kingdoms joined to the Crown, just as Naples or Navarra.

An attempt to o ffer a new re flection on an old question The rst step in renewing a discussion with positions continue the debate academia since Levene's explicit formulation, the debate on the political status of the Indies has been followed, in most cases, by an implicit value judgment on the legitimacy and fairness of Spanish action in the Americas. Denying the colonial nature of Spanish American territories seemed certain historical of indigenous peoples by the Spaniards. De nitely, it is utopian history of value judg- ments. does not historical analysis with ethical judgment or assert the impossibility to distinguish between both areas. In other words, and regarding this issue, it should be possible to deny the colonial nature of Spanish Am erican territories for the sake of a more accurate interpretation terms, general, whether European or Spanish American, as already distinguished in the 18th Century. And vice versa. Thus, discussion the eld. Having explained the epistemological scope of our study, we should rephrase it in positive terms. Some reference to the lands of the New World and their relation with the Castilian Crown between the late 15th Century and the rst third of the 19th Cen- tury? To what extent was describing the union as accessory useful to classify the relationship between Spanish America and Castile properly? How did this accessory union evolve between 18th Centuries? This issue - as raised - reminds us of another great historical debate in the past decades: the one on the rise of the modern State. Now, as then, we could attempt to solve it in several ways. One of them is to begin by dening the concept under discussion (\"colonies, \" \"State\") as broadly as possible so that it may be applied to the period concerned. This is the option chosen by Benard. It was also the view of most of the historiography focused on the Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 43study of the modern State. According to Jellinek, its de nition was based on t h r e ec o r ee l e m e n t s :as u p r e m ep o w e r ,at e r r i t o r ya n dap o p u l a t i o n .38In such broad terms, the \"State\" formula was applicable to political formations a sh e t e r o g e n e o u sa sM o n a r c h i e si nt h el a t eM i d d l eA g e s ,t h e\" a b s o l u t e \" Monarchies of the Modern Age, and the liberal States of the 19th Century. This even led to a heated discussion in Spain on the potential existence of a Visigoth State. 39 The main problem of such an approach is the lack or loss of semantic density of key concepts of political and legal history. Formulating in very broad terms concepts which are key to our understanding of history, such as \"State\" or - in our - \"colony\" , will severely impair their interpretative potentiality in the long run. Therefore, it is not surprising that they are eventually replaced with other concepts which for process of historical may be caused by the certain historiography has proven, one may discuss the State under Old Regime without it getting tainted with contemporary implications, that is, slipping in anach-ronisms by projecting into the past categories and ways of thinking that did not exist at that time. 41 From that point of view, the question Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re asked at the beginning of her article makes history from the 16th Century to their independence and up to the present?\" 42We should add two further Are those contents consistent with the place occupied by the Indies under the Spanish Monarchy, with the political system established there a fter 38 J ellinek (1943). 39 T orres L\u00f3pez (1926). 40 A good critical explanation of the discussion about the so-called \"modern State, \" in: Garriga Acosta (2004) 1-5. 41 I am referring to the work by Paolo Grossi and the Florentine school of legal historians.

I believe these are the questions that should be asked. It is outside the scope of this paper to answer each of them in detail, as that would and the this old discussion. Therefore, it is convenient to review the process of integration of the Indies into the Spanish Monarchy during the 16th and 17th Centuries, and the consequences of the establish-ment of a new dynasty at the beginning of the 18th Century for both the Americas and the other territories of the formerly universal Monarchy. In short, this is about de ning the scope of the accessory nature of the union with Castile during these Centuries; the historical evolution of its \"contents. \" 1 . T h eI n d i e sa n dt h eH o u s eo fA u s t r i a It is commonplace in historiography to identify the rise of the Bourbon dynasty to the Spanish throne at the turn of the 18th Century as a substantial change in the conception of the Monarchy. During the 16th and 17th Cen-turies, the Spanish universal Monarchy had been a model of composite and plural Monarchy - the throne being occupied by kings of the House of Austria - where every kingdom maintained its original rights and liberties. The Indies, a territory conquered and incorporated into the Crown of Castile in the form of an accessory union, an 43part of this conglom- erate of kingdoms and crowns of the Monarch. Papal Bulls granted dominion over the to the Catholic Monarchs and their \"heirs and successors, the Kings of Castile and Leon. \"44 4 3 A sc a nb er e a di nt h e Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias , Charles V had sworn in 1519 that the Indies \"would always remain united, and for their greater perpetuity and strength, we prohibit the disposal thereof.

In words joined under an aeque principaliter union \"retain their own nature and keep it separate, as though they were still ruled by the same princes prior to the union, each keeping the same law as if they were to remain separate. \"45In contrast, where a province was added or joined to a kingdom under an accessory union, they became a single kingdom governed by the law and privileges of the kingdom to which they were united.46 As regards Spanish American territories, the accessory nature of their union to the Kingdom of Castile rapidly caught on. The lack of consolidated Christian kingdoms in the New World, such as that of Navarre in the Old, made it easier to consider those foreign lands a mere extension of the Old World, and especially of Castile. That is why, from the outset, Castilian Law was applied generally in the Americas, together with the old ius commune , which was also that of the New World, as well as the new local laws, expressed in a host of written or customary sources. From this standpoint, the order of the sources applicable in Spanish America did not give rise to any particular dispute, as had been the case in other conquered territories, such as Navarre. 47According to the Ordenanzas de Audiencias [Ordinances of Audiencias ] of 1530, Emperor Charles V had ruled that, were the provisions issued for Spanish America not to apply, the laws of the Kingdom of Castile would apply in accordance with the Leyes of Toro]. This prin- ciple was reproduced in the Recopilaci\u00f3n [Compilation] of 1681, along with another law whereby \"such cases as may not be determined by the laws of this Recopilaci\u00f3n shall be subject to the laws of the Recopilaci\u00f3n y Partidas [Compilation and Seven-Part Code] of this Kingdom of Castile. \"48 On the other hand, in the Ordenanzas del Consejo de Indias [Ordinances of the Council of the Indies] of 1571, Philip II had mandated that the \"States 45 Regarding s ei nM o n a r c h i aH i s p a n i c aa e q u ep r i n - cipaliter: Regna vero indiarum Lusitaniae. \" C de Valdaura (1677) 187. 46 C resp\u00ed de Valdaura (1677) 187. 47 See G al\u00e1nLorda (2012). 48 Book II, Title I, Laws II and I. 46 Rafael D.

This process included the division of the Spanish American territory into major provinces, ruled by their respective Audiencias , and minor provinces, as well as the foundation of cities.

In Indies and Kingdoms of Grenade or Murcia on the same footing as territories which had joined Castile under an evidenced the limitations of legal theories conceived at a time when there was only one world: the Old World. Accordingly, as time went by, the territorial status of the Indies, as prov- inces which had joined Castile under an accessory union, was gradually overtaken by reality. They shared Castile's political status, since they were part of it, as if they were a mere extension of its territory. Nevertheless, their 49 Book II, Title II, Law XIII: \"and because the kingdoms of Castile and the Indies one Crown, their laws and government system ought therefore to be as alike as possible. The members of the Council shall try, in the laws and institutions which they may estab- lish for those States, to reduce the form and manner of their government to the style and order by which the kingdoms of Castile and Leon are ruled to the extent allowed by the diversity and di fference of lands and peoples. \" Philip II, Ordinance 14 of the Council of 1571. 50 The limitation of this distinction to explain the complexity of the unions between king- doms in the Modern Age has been highlighted by Elliott. The English historian cited as an example the union between England and Scotland in 1707, a type of union that does not t fully into any of these categories. E lliot (2009) 15. Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 47exceptional nature under the Spanish Monarchy, characterized, inter alia ,b y their vast territory located thousands of kilometers away from the Peninsula, their abundant natural resources, and, more particularly, the diverse ethnic groups their inhabitants, was also re flected in the institutional and legal framework. It was not easy to establish a legal regime to govern that territory by resorting to Castilian Law only, based on the categories of ius commune .B o t h laws were transplanted to Spanish America but they underwent profound transformations. Moreover, that legal regime with a myriad of provisions issued by both the Court and the di fferent instances of Spanish American governments. But, as Tau has determined, the source of law that better adapted to the new needs was custom. 51The speci c nature of this new law did not re flect only in the well-known Recopilaci\u00f3n de Leyes de Indias [Compilation of Indias' Law], a compilation promulgated by Charles II in 1681 which had no parallel in the territories that had joined Castile under an accessory union; it found its greatest expression in the customary dimension, both in the so-called Republic of Spaniards and Republic of Indians. In this light, although it is important to realize that there was no legal regime of the Indies as such, di fferent from that of Castile, this conclusion is considerably played down, if not in the context of jurists' discourse - with its mere conceptual distinctions - than in the context of law in action. The particularity of those lands was not only re flected in the legal sources, b u ta tt h ei n s t i t u t i o n a ll e v e la sw e l l .S u ffice it to mention, the institutions created ex novo or the legal entities ius commune for the government of indigenous peoples, such as encomiendas or indigenous villages. In other cases, legal solutions originally conceived for other situations were applied, w i t hab r o a du s eo fa n a l o g ya sat o o lt oc o n s t r u ea n do r g a n i z et h e s en e w realities. The most evident case, which most had their natural freedom and their condition as vassals of the Crown recognized from as early as 1500, became legally incorporated in the corporative regime of the Monarchy, although in 51 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2001). 52 See D uve(2004).

This shared legal condition cannot be understood in terms of social homogenization. The \"Indians\" were in reality a creation of the conquest. Before the Spaniards' arrival, the American continent was populated highly diverse ethnic communities: the Mayas, Aymaras, Mexicas, Arauca-nians, etc., but not by \"Indians. \" A fter the conquest, and under very diverse rights and obliga- tions which the these communities, the so-called \"Republic of a plurality of \"personal\" statutes, did not remain the same over the Centuries either. The consequences of the military, cultural and legal conquest of the territory among natives in those lands are explained by di fferent factors. A few of them include: the transformation of their old traditions; their acceptance conquerors; or and by the Spaniards; and their adaptation to new religious and cultural patterns or to the political mecha- nisms imposed by the Crown. In some cases, the nal result was the mere extinction or the drastic reduction of the American Indian population; in other cases, it was the compulsory or negotiated integration into a new social and political structure, the Spanish Monarchy, in which they would interact with other groups in identity rede- also examples of escape to the margins of the system over the Centuries, a prolonged resistance which could still not on articulated in more limited geographical areas, mainly in cities, towns, villages or farms, based on a common religion and united under the Sovereign, of whom everyone was a vassal. As late as 1806, in an inquiry on marriage and access to o ffices by mulattos, the Council of the Indies stated that \" I ti su n d e n i a b l et h a tt h ee x i s t e n c eo fd i fferent hierarchies and classes is survival and governance the under the Spanish Monarchy 49vassal's obedience of and respect for the Sovereign's authority, a system all the more necessary in the Americas, given the greater distance from the throne (...). \"53 This does not mean economic criteria were irrelevant; they were simply not recognized for the social and cult ural role they would play during the 19th and exploited, it is inappropriate to analyze Spanish American social reality solely in these especially placing a subordinate class, the \"Indians, \" against another, the white, that would appear - by contrast - as \"independent\" or \"dominant. \" As can be clearly inferred from the words of the Council transcribed American society, well of groups or estates that depended on each other, to a greater or their di fferent manifestations. However, a phenomenon Indies the existence These pre-modern political system, ideally based on patterns of inequality, under entails no justi cation whatso- any other pattern of inequality existing in those times.

Furthermore, the Councils were also the meeting point between the on whose behalf they acted, and the territories subject to his jurisdiction, which they also represented, that is to say, which they caused to appear in spirit before the King. In such regard, Sol\u00f3rzano stated that \"the quality regu- lated by that of the kingdoms and states they rule and represent. \" 61Similarly, less honoured, and preferred according to the place and status of the Princes or Provinces they sometimes represented. \" 62Hence, inter alia ,t h er e l e v a n c eo fc o n flicts over precedence among Councils was such that, from our viewpoint, alien to the culture prevailing at the time, it is impossible to understand. In this case, and on the basis of these assump-tions, Sol\u00f3rzano did not hesitate to assert the prominence of the Council of the Indies over the Council of Flanders in public acts, since the former was in charge of \"not only the government of a county or kingdom, but that of an empire which embraces so many kingdoms and such rich and powerful provinces, or, in better words, the broadest and most extended Monarchy the world has ever known, as it actually comprises another world. \" 63 60 B erm\u00fadez de Pedraza (1635) 1-3, cited in: R ivero Rodr\u00edguez (2004) 507. 61 S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereira (1776) 177. 62 Ibid. (1776) 177. 63 Ibid. 178. In another passage of this same memorial, Sol\u00f3rzano states that by virtue of the accessory union it might be understood that the Empire of the Indies, just as its governing Council, is part of that of Castile (p. 188). He also explains that the Council of the Indies came into being as a result of the development of business on those lands, so it is possible to assert that once the administration of these matters was removed from the Council of Castile, \"authority [remained] united as a whole. \" (p. 189). These statements, which appa- rently deny the personality of the Council of the Indies as a separate institution from the Council of Castile, ought to be interpreted within the framework in which Sol\u00f3rzano formulated them, i. e., to prove the seniority of the Council of the Indies over that of Flanders. In a di fferent paragraph of this memorial, he argued that the Council of the 52 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezAs Rivero has pointed out with reference to the Council of Italy, organicity, within their just like the other kingdoms and crowns. 64That is how the Council of the Indies acted in relation to Spanish American land. In spite of its great diversity and the complexity of its jurisdictional structures, linked to the very evolution of the process of conquest and colonization, the existence of a Council of the Indies, gradu- ally distinguished from that of Castile, also led to the endowment of those territories with a certain political status of their own within the Castilian Crown. However, this process was not a utomatic. As we have already stated, in 1511 there was a Board within the Council of Castile, responsible for hearing issues pertaining to the Indies, while in 1524 it became a separate Council. Under the Ordenanzas de 1571 [Ordinances of 1571], Philip II prohibited the other Councils and cou rts from intruding issues pertaining to the Indies, thus consolid its position within the system of Councils, as well as that of the Indies within the Castilian Crown.65In 1600, just like the Council of Castile, the Council of the Indies was provided with its own Chamber for the allocation of bene ts and o ffices in the Indies. 66In 1614, Philip III ordered that no mandate served by another council be observed unless it had already been submitted to the Council of the Indies. In 1626, Philip IV mandated that no pragmatic sanction promulgated in the Kingdoms of be enforced in Spanish America, unless a mandate issued by the Council of the Indies ordered that it had to be observed. 67 Ten years later, this same King conferred ecclesiastical powers upon the Council of the Indies, thus inhibiting the Council of Castile. 68 Indies is truly Supreme, without possible recourse to any other tribunal, as Philip II expressly established in the second ordinance of 1571 (p. 198). 64 R ivero Rodr\u00edguez (2004) 507. 65 Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias, Book II, Title II, Law II: \"the Council of the Indies shall have supreme jurisdiction over the West Indies, whether already or dis-covered, and the business therefrom and depending thereon, and for their good judicial administration it may issue Orders and consult with our Laws, Pragmatic Ordinances, etc. \" 66 S ch\u00e4fer(1935) 179. 67 Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias, Book II, Title I, Law XXXIX.68 Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes de Indias, Book II, Title II, Law III. Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 53If, within the Court, the foundation of the Council provided an institu- tional dramatization of the unity of the New World without altering its legal status - that of a territory which had joined the Crown of Castile under an accessory union - in the Indies, the consolidation of a civic culture and the formation of a creole elite enabled the gradual formulation of a self-de ning discourse, which, on the basis of its urban location, also referred to the Indies as an entity distinct from Castile within the realm of the Spanish Monarchy. This discourse revolved mainly around the natural obligation of reserving o ffices for the natives of those lands. 69Logically, was at defending local o ffices from Castilians. The purpose was to turn Spanish America into a perfect community, a separate territory within the common Spanish Monarchy, as was Navarre. Since the late 16th Century, this dis- course was accompanied by a remarkable increase in the level of self-govern- ment of local powers in the Indies, which was mostly achieved by means of t h ep u r c h a s eo fm o s to ft h eo ffices in Spanish America, in particular, in audiencias and cabildos .70 2. The Bourbons and the Hispanization of the plural Monarchy When Charles II died, the Spanish Monarchy had a plural composition where the Indies had gradually acquired some political entity, both on the institu-tional level and that concerning political discourse. On the basis of these assumptions, the establishment of the Bourbon Dynasty has been tradition- ally construed as the beginning of a clear change of direction. Thus, the enthronement of Philip V would not hav e entailed just the extinction of the judicial and executive institutions proper to the territories of the Crown of Aragon and, accordingly, their disappearance as a political entity di fferent from the Crown of Castile, but, in particular, it would have entailed the beginning of a new way of thinking \"Spain, \" focused on the increasing cen-tralism suc would have concluded in the reign of Charles IV with the in fluence of the almighty Godoy, whose despotism would have led directly to the crisis of the Mon-archy and, consequently, to the extinction of the Hispanic Empire, except for some colonies such as Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. 69 See H erzog (2004); G arriga Acosta (2003). 70 See the already classic B urkholder /Chandler (1977). 54 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezNow is not the time to criticize this reading of 18th-Century Spain, rather consolidated in historiography, or to t race the origins of this constructive paradigm.71Clearly, there are many reasons supporting this interpretation. In addition to the Nueva Planta Decrees and the patrimonial understanding of power behind the acts by Philip V ,72there are many other measures evidencing as well as in recovering positions of power. In this regard, we should men-tion, by way of example: the creation and development of the Secretariats of State [ Secretar\u00edas de Estado y del Despacho ]; the creation of intendencias ;t h e professionalization of army; the (temporary) rationalization of tax reform of the system of fleets and galley slaves; and the introduction of the company system in p e r i p h e r a lr e g i o n s ,o rt h es t r u g g l et oc o n t r o lt h es a l eo fo ffices. However, not lose the Monarchy upon any process of nationaliza- tion and standardization of the political territory. Despite these and other measures of great signi cance adopted by successive Bourbon kings, plurality and its jurisdictional structures. State did not suppress all secular councils. In fact, some of them, such as those in Castile or, to a lesser extent, in Navarre and the Indies, continued playing a in the governance of their 73On the other hand, intendentes coexisted with corre- gidores and alcaldes mayores in the Peninsula and in the Americas, and the audiencias maintained their leading role over this period. We should further of political power. This institutional \"duplicity, \" which has led histor-iography to talk about the con flictive coexistence over this Century of two 71 An explanation for the rst half of the Century, based on propaganda by the supporters of the Bourbon dynasty in the succession con flict can be found in S tiffoni (1989). 72 On the patrimonial logic behind the measures adopted by Phillip V , see F ern\u00e1ndez Albaladejo (1992) G 94-96. 73 S es\u00e9Alegre (1994); G arc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (1998).

Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 55parallel or overlapping Monarchies - one \"administrative, \" the other \"juris- dictional\" -,74explains some of the di fficulties in understanding the 18th Century from the perspective of the operation of di fferent power dynamics. Such diversity of institutional structures and logic of power can be clearly seen at the higher governmental levels of the Monarchy. In this case, the Council of the Indies saw its authority disputed by the creation of a Secre-tariat of State of the Navy and the Indies. It was established in 1714, together with the Secretariats of War, State and Justice, which re flected not only the implementation of a new form of government in matters related to the New World, but also the consideration of the Indies as a mere branch of \"admin-istration, \" along with others such as the Navy or War. In a sense, the measure could be construed as a denial of the political status implicitly recognized with the creation and consolidation of a Council of the Indies over the previous two Centuries, coexisting with other councils for other territories of the Monarchy. In the 18th Century, the Secretariat of State had a checkered evolution. 75 It was removed in 1715, restored in 1720 as Secretariat of War, the Navy and the Indies, only to become the Secretariat of the Navy and the Indies in 1721. In 1754, its structure changed when matters pertaining to the Indies were separated from those pertaining to th e Navy, to form two separate Secretar- iats of State which, nonetheless, were still headed by the same Secretary. In 1787, upon the death of G \u00e1lvez and the creation of the Junta Suprema de Estado [Supreme Board of State], the Secretariat of the Indies was split into two with a view to expediting the handling of matters in the Americas. In 1790, in line with Floridablanca's projections to join interests on both sides of the Atlantic, matters concerning the Indies were distributed among the other ve Secretariats of State, a solution that had already been contem- plated in the instruction reserved for the Junta de Estado (No. CXLV). This was aimed not only at streamlining and securing \"Treasury and War expenses, resources interests, charges and objects, 74 On this regard, see the classic work by H inrichs (1986). On the di fficulty to subsitute the jurisdictional power model with one purely \"administrative\" in the Old Regime, see Mannori (1990). 75 See G \u00f3mez G\u00f3mez (1993); E scudero (2001). 56 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezwhich destroys the Spanish Monarchy and governing the Americas was not the only one, and not even the most prevalent in the Court, during the second half of the 18th Century. The fact that most matters concerning the Americas were handled through the speci c channels, that is, through the relevant Secretariat of State, did not downplay the leading role of the secular Council of the Indies. While still being the highest court for Spanish American matters, the Coun- c i la l s oe x p e r i e n c e dac h a n g ei nc o m p o s i t i o ni nt h er e i g no fC h a r l e sI I Ia n d became a benchmark for most of the re forms introduced in the Americas during those years. 77Its continuity over time was, on an institutional level, a clear manifestation of the speci c nature of the Spanish American territories within the Crown of Castile. It was also manifestation of the ongoing idea of government linked to the right of justice. Within the framework of this institutional complexity, merely outlined here for the peak of the Monarchy, the Ministers of Charles III adopted the policies to be implemented a fter the defeat in the Seven Years' War along lines that had already been anticipated during the previous two reigns. On the international level, the imperial expansion of foreign powers, mainly England, France and Holland, demande d political action to ensure Spanish dominion over the New World. A fter the independence of the thirteen colonies in America, it became even more necessary to change a traditional system of government that had allowed a high degree of self-government in those lands. In this context, we can also gain a better insight into the consolidation of a discourse and politics with colonia l features in the Court, as well as the reactions this caused among the elites of the Indies. It was at that moment, in the 18th Century and not before, that the Indies were referred to as colonies for the rst time. It should be noted, however, that just as it is not possible to reduce the 18th-Century institutional structure of the Mon-archy to a consistent and systematic unit - since it was more the outcome of a historic development marked by a an empty space 76 E scudero (2001), II, 68. 77 I have dealt with this matter in G arcia P\u00e9rez (1998). This \"rebirth of the Council\" was brought to attention by B urkholder (1976). Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 57available to the Sovereign -, neither unitize the di fferent policies issued by the Court for the Americas in the 18th Century, or any supporting discourse to legitimize them. Therefore, while focusing on the emergence of a true \"colonial\" discourse in the 18th Century, we should not overlook its coexistence with other discourse of a di fferent nature, aimed at achieving a better unity of interests between Creole elites and the Crown. We have just seen this when discussing the extinction of the Secretariats of State for the Indies in 1790, with Floridablanca leading the King's Ministers. Some years earlier, in 1768, the extraordinary Council formed in the Council of Castile had articulated the need to send Spaniards to the Indies to hold \"the major o ffices, Bishoprics and Sinecures, and to have the Creoles hold equivalent o ffices in Spain. \" This would establish stronger ties and lead to a \"united Nation. \" The goal was to ease tension in the Americas a fter the expulsion of the Jesuits and to deter any independence movement. 78 In addition to this unifying discourse, we should mention the persistence of old political conceptions over the whole 18th Century, in line with the prevailing ideas of previous Centuries. In light of this plural background, we may assess the scope of colonial discourse supported by some Ministers and materialized in the adaptation of speci c political measures for the Americas during the last decades of the Old Regime. 3. Colonial discourse and its institutional incidence It is not our intent to discuss here detail the reforms the Peninsulars vis-\u00e0-vis the Creoles; the extension of the system of intendencias to most of the Americas; the creation of new viceroyalties and provincial boun-daries; the introduction of the a nent Royal Army, and the implementation of the militia system, etc. 79While we cannot state - as noted above - that the Court had developed a consistent political program for the Americas, since actors, interests and principles 78 The report is reproduced by N avarro Garc\u00eda (1996). Quotes on page 205. 79 Historiography has given considerable attention to the reforms in Spanish American pol- itics in the 18th Century. For a general vision, with the corresponding (1991). 58 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezinvolved in the adoption and execution of such decisions varied to a great extent, we can state that there were some goals behind many of the reforms carried out during the second half of the 18th Century. On the one hand, as o ften underlined, \"Bourbon reforms\" were from the Amer-icas. Though the target of these policies was the Americas, they focused b a s i c a l l yo nS p a i n ,o nt h ep r e s e r v a t i o no fi t sE m p i r ei na ni n t e r n a t i o n a l setting di fferent from that of previous Centuries. At the same time, within the context of the Audiencias - a centerpiece of the American government -, action was taken to restore a justice system that had been shaken over decades by practices such as the sale of Court o ffices or, more generally, the deep-seated roots of judges in the Indies society. 80 These reforms were accompanied with the simultaneous publication of projects concerning the government of Spanish America. The presence of enlightened ideals of government among many of the Court's Ministers, with emphasis on virtues of trade progress, and the exemplary for their overseas domains, also led Spain to work on new governmental pro-posals for the Americas, whereby such lands could emerge from \"their state of decadence, \" a popular clich\u00e9 then. In most cases, the proposals were clearly in line with those adopted during the rst half of the Century by authors such as Macanaz, Jer\u00f3nimo de Ust \u00e1riz or the author of \" Nuevo sistema de gobierno para la Am\u00e9rica \" [\"New Governmental System for the Americas\"], dated 1743 and mistakenly attributed to Jos\u00e9 del Campillo.81Even if it is possible to establish a connection between the theoretical proposals and the institutional reforms, it is both areas di ffer- entiated. Both are important from a historical point of view. Both reveal the ideas then prevailing in the Court's circles about the right position of the Americas within the Spanish Monarchy. However, their practical signi cance has not been the same. The terms used by the Ministers and senior Offi cers of III, in the terms \"Kingdoms\" and \"Provinces, \" predominantly used in the political jargon, particularly in the legal area, now included the term 80 See G arriga Acosta (2002). 81 See N avarro Garc\u00eda (1995a). Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 59\"colonies. \" Yet, the term was o ften reserved to refer to colonies of foreign p o w e r s ,i . e . ,F r e n c h ,E n g l i s h ,D u t c h ,o rP o r t u g u e s ec o l o n i e s .W h i l ea ne m - pirical study should be conducted to sources would be able to note it. In other cases, the use of the binomial metropolis-colonies reveals the modernization of a discourse that was still based on traditional guidelines or, at least, that had not yet adopted the patterns of modern colonialism. There are many examples in that regard, but let us focus on the policy pursued by the Crown in the Americas during the reign of Charles III. We refer to the well-known plan of intendencias designed by G \u00e1lvez after visiting New Spain, and the reports prepared by the Bishops of Puebla and \"this metropolis, \" i. e., Mexico, as mandated by the Viceroy of New Spain, the Marquis de Croix. 82 After a careful reading of the project, one can note the coexistence of colonial languages and policies with others consistent with reformist prem-ises of the Old Regime, where the preservation of the political order appears related to the eff of is to \"standardize both the government of these great Colonies and the government of the metrop-olis, \" since intendencias had already been introduced into the Peninsula fty years earlier. While G \u00e1lvez uses the terms \"colonies\" and \"metropolis, \" the standardization the former and the latter is inconsistent with politics of a colonial nature. Spanish Americans could consider it despotic - rather than colonial - action to the extent it violated acquired rights. The problem lay \"the healthy remedies that had cured the ills of head. \" 83 According to G \u00e1lvez, the problem was that the the from \"establishing good order and justice. \" The fact was that the one hundred and fty alcaldes mayores , having of the King's the Crown itself, which lost substantial income. The creation of the o ffice of 82 \"Informe y plan de intendencias que conviene establecer en este reino de Nueva Espa \u00f1a\" , reproduced in Garc\u00eda (1995b) 112-114. 60 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezintendente was, in the opinion of G \u00e1lvez, the remedy for this \"ruinous con- stitution. \"84 At the same the plan included indications that revealed the sub- ordination of American to to setting up factories \"prohibited in the Colonies. \" It was not G \u00e1lvez's original idea. From this standpoint, the subordination of manufacturing companies in the Indies to Peninsular interests had been supported some years earlier by the author of Nuevo Sistema de Gobierno .85However, this was neither the only nor the primary goal of Bourbon reformist policies, aimed rather at regaining control over power structures on both sides of the Atlantic and at securing the integrity of possessions new either. Nonetheless, the proposal insisted on the need to eradicate a business that caused considerable harm: the distribution of merchandise.87 The report prepared by the Bishop of Puebla, strongly in favor of G \u00e1lvez's proposals, focused on the need to standardize government on sides of the Atlantic; language used nor the proposals made allow us to talk about the emergence of a new colonial mindset. Firstly, the Bishop denied the novelty of the project, as it already existed in Spain. Expanding it into the Americas - explained - would avoid losing many souls and would put an end to the ill-treatment of indigenous people by alcaldes mayores and to the damage caused to the Royal Treasury. The plan was justi ed by its e ffects and by itself: Since Spain (identi ed with Castile) and the Americas as possible, as vindicated the history of colonization. The Bishop was not thinking about other foreign powers' P erez Herrero /Naranjo Orovio /Casanovas Codina (2008) 40. 87 Informe y plan de intendencias (n. 82) 123, 125.

Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 61On the other hand, dependence on Spain was also justi ed in accordance with traditional reasons. The Indies were members of the Spanish Monarchy, branches of a tree, and, as such, should bear fruit. Intendencias would not only put an end to vassal su ffering, but also report substantial pro ts to the Royal Treasury.89 The Bishop of Mexico approved the plan proposed by G \u00e1lvez too; he considered the abusive behavior of alcaldes mayores to be the root of all evil of Spanish American government. Intendentes would ll the gap between alcaldes mayores and viceroys. They were even more necessary than in Spain, where inhabitants of villages were more rational. Although he did not dwell on more theoretical considerations, he did make reference to the conquest in order to stress the need to accommodate natives' lives to the conquerors' laws and customs. 90 The goal set by the Crown to regain control over power structures in the Americas, in order to guarantee that justice be served and that all necessary r e s o u r c e st oe n f o r c ei t sA t l a n t i cp o l i c yb ee x t r a c t e d ,e n d e du p-a si sw e l l known - with G \u00e1lvez as Minister of the Indies, in an attempt to exclude Creoles from holding major political and judicial o ffices. 91However, it is one thing to have measures adopted in Court, and quite another to imple-ment them in America. In either case, it is clear that both the underlying discourse of most projects as well as the measures implemented in the second half of the 18th Century impaired the rights and interests of many American elites. In both cases, a utilitarian vision of the Americas was gain- ing momentum, which translated into a divergence between Monarchy and Nation. The Indies were part of the Monarchy's - but not of the Nation's - discourse. 92 It was a process already under way. The loss of Spanish dominions in Europe a fter the War \"nationalization\" of started to develop. With the encouragement of the Court and the support of di fferent cultural groups, an interpretation of history inclined to 93However, this encoun- 131. ortillo (2006) 32-34. 93 For the development of Castilian legal history as Spanish legal history, see V allejo (2002). 62 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9reztered resistance in certain territories, such as the Basque Provinces and the Kingdom of Navarre - especially -, which, since ancient times, had had their own laws, governmental and judicial institutions. Here also an alternative discourse of a constitutional nature emerged which, as would be the case in the Americas, tended to emphasize its \"separation\" from Castile, that is, its essence as a perfect political community, whether as a province, dominion or kingdom. Yet, the consequences of the establishment of a Spanish Nation partially different from the Monarchy were not the same for Peninsular and oceanic territories. Navarre and the Basque Provinces were still part of both, even though their rights and liberties, particularly in the scal and military areas, were increasingly challenged. Conversely, the Indies appeared more and more as politically available to serve the interests of the Monarchy's principal Domain, namely the Nation. In this regard, it is no coincidence that one of the Ministers who, as prosecutor of the Council of Castile, had p l a y e dam o r ep r o m i n e n tr o l ei nt h ec o n flicts between the Kingdom of Navarre and the Court since 1770, 94Pedro Rodr\u00edguez de Campomanes, was also the author of one of the treatises that best featured the subordinate nature of the Indies to the Nation, to which - seemingly - they did not belong. This can be noted by merely reading the acknowledgment at the beginning of his treatise \" Reflexiones sobre el comercio espa\u00f1ol a Indias [Reflec- tions on the Spanish Trade to Indias]\" .95 94 I refer to the con flicts over levies and transfer of customs houses. In Navarre forced to elaborate constitutional discourse of their scal and military rights and liberties. Allow me to refer you to G arc\u00eda P\u00e9rez (2008) 205-262. 95 To Campomanes, the decadence \"of our farmers and cra ftsmen is that there is no dispatch of the fruit of their work or cra ft, \" which damaged the strength of the Monarchy, based on its trade. \" However, Campomanes wondered \"Who will believe, Sir, knowing that Your Majesty dominates the largest and best part of the Americas, where there are many millions of Your Majesty's vassals, that these goods have no dispatch?\" The work he presented was aimed at revealing the cause of this evil which - in the words of the prosecutor of the Council of Castile - could only reside \"in the body of the Nation or in the rules hitherto observed on the tra ffic to and from the Indies. \" The problem was, i n d e e d ,i nt h er u l e s .T h et r a d eb a ni m p o s e d\" o nt h eA m e r i c a sp o r t si sf a rf r o ma d m i r a b l e - he noted - as the Colonies should not have concurrent navigation with the matrix. But it is unprecedented for Spain to su ffer this exclusion. \" In this context, the Indies were not the Nation, but colonies at its service. C ampomanes (1988) 3-4. Revisiting the Colonial Status under the unequal condition the well- known projects developed by Intendente Jos\u00e9 \u00c1balos (1780), by the Count of Aranda (1783), and by the almighty Godoy (1804) - which was even known and approved by Charles IV -. All of them agreed on the conven-ience of dividing the Indies into several Monarchies led by members of the Spanish Royal Family. 96Regardless of the feasibility of such proposals, the as territories was clear during Godoy's government with the transfer of Santo Domingo to France in 1795, and Louisiana and Trinidad to England in 1800 and 1802, respectively. 97 However, the key trigger for the creation of a discourse of colonial denun- ciation was the crisis of the Monarchy a fter the entry of French troops into Spain and the abdication of the Spanish Monarchs in favor of Napoleon. The ensuing power vacuum and the di fferent solutions then defended provided the perfect framework for the development of an anti-colonial discourse in the Americas. In this new and unforeseen context, the term colony became instrumental in the ght between political projects on both sides of the Atlantic: within the Peninsula, in order to gain American support for the constitutional case in Cadiz and, in general, for the war of liberation against Napoleon; in the Americas, in order to support the di fferent projects for an autonomous government at rst, and an independent one later on. 98Thus, the \"colonial paradigm, \" to quote Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re, a paradigm which has dominated the Latin American historiography so far. III. Final Considerations It is commonplace to assert from their own interpretive categories. It is not an easy task.

Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezin these theoretical rather than practical debates, no one questions convenient it is for a historian to avoid into the past categories or concepts coined or re-elaborated in the present time to provide solutions to current world problems.99 In the case at hand, it is quite clear from what has been described in these pages that, a fter their conquest and incorporation into Castile, the Indies became part of the Spanish universal Monarchy. The colonization model on which the Spanish based their conquests was not the one that predominated as from the second half of the 18th Century - and particularly during the 19th and 20th Centuries -, used by main European powers. Rather, at least ideally, it resembled the Roman model. 100That late 18th Century the words colony andcolonize were understood both in diction- a r i e sa n du s a g ea sw e l la si nl e g a lt e x t sa ss y n o n y m so f population and populate .101In the second half of the past Century, the term colony acquired the modern sense of economic exploitation both in the republic of letters as in the European Courts.102 The ideal reference to the ancient colonization model does not preclude me from stating that the colonization of the Indies had particular or speci c features: by way of example, and a dominant times were signi cantly di fferent. In the 15th Century, the and colonization of the Americas also involved joining the Indies to Castile under an accessory union and, consequently, transferring the Castil- ian legal order to the new lands. However, the di fferent treatment required by the New World over the years resulted in a progressive increase in its 99 G addis (2002); W ood (2008). 100 See P adgen (2005) chapter 1. Regarding the connection between liberalism and imperial- ism in the mid nineteenth Century, see P itts (2006). 101 \" Colony : a town or parcel of land that has been populated by foreign people taken from the City which owns such territory or from some other place. The word also meant the places populated peoples by the Romans (...). In Spain, there were many towns that had been Roman colonies. \" C ovarrubias Orozco (1674) 154. The de nition of the term \"colony\" in the Diccionario de Autoridades de 1729 , 419, is practically the same. This ancient meaning of the word colony also appears in Pol\u00edtica Indiana by S ol\u00f3rzano Pereira , as has been pointed out by 102 L emp\u00e9ri\u00e8re (2004b) 114-116. as a territory distinct from Castile, it was an accessory part of the latter. This particular or speci c feature was re flected on the institutional level, with the creation of the Council of the Indies and the particular evolution of its Audiencias and its municipios , of Spaniards and of Indians, as well as in the legal sources, with the leading role of custom and the speci city of the law of the Indies, paradigmatically represented in the Recopilaci\u00f3n [Compilation] of 1681. In this respect, the accessory nature of the union gradually developed turning the Indies into a territory more similar to Navarre or Aragon than to other kingdoms joined to Castile under an accessory union, such as Granada or Murcia. At the same time, a creole discourse emerged - studied from this perspective by Garriga - that viewed Spanish America as a perfect community separate from Castile. The purpose was to secure that o ffices to be held in the Indies were reserved for natives of those lands and not for Spaniards. estate-based social order, unevenly constituted, was also transplanted to the New World but with some clear di fferences. In addition to the peoples into this di fferent peoples, and the degree ilation of European culture and the Catholic also di well as the transformations that the cultures In case, and dependence that protectionist in these Centuries, the colonial relationship model - understood in its modern sense - does not seem to be the best suited to explain the place occupied by the Indies and their people within the Spanish Monarchy. In this respect, we agree with Tau when he posits the \"inappropriateness of the word colony to describe generically the political condition of the Indies. \" No political entity in the Spanish Monarchy is referred to by that name in legal or political texts, in custom or in practice. 104Moreover, the emergence of a colonial 103 G arriga Acosta (2006) 72-93. 104 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 121. 66 Rafael D. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rezpolitical discourse in the 18th Century and the adoption of measures reveal- ing a colonial conception of the Indies did not result in a substantial trans- formation of the political model of the Spanish Therefore, from a historiographical perspective, it seems more more fruitful, to assume the legal categories used at the time to construct the Spanish American space. The Indies were provinces or kingdoms joined to the Crown of Castile under an accessory union. Henceforth, it is the duty of historians to determine the concrete meaning of these categories in each historical period, avoiding use of schemes that are too rationalist and anachronistic to comprehend a reality which then, just as now, was beyond any simplistic approach to systematization. On the other hand, adopting perspectives assume a plurality of con- current jurisdictions in Spanish America, leaving aside mental structures too bound to state standards, can provide a more realistic approach to the relationships between the Crown and the New World. From this perspective, the leading role that indigenous peoples - with their rights and traditions - played in the creation of the Spanish American legal order should also be acknowledged. Without underestimating the signi policies the head of the Monarchy pursued, through the Council of the Indies, Juntas [Boards] or the Secretariats of State, the fact that they were focused on the places where the di fferent social actors converged - mainly cities and towns - evidences the inappropriateness of explaining political societies of the Old Regime too flatly or homogeneously.105In this area, dominated by the existence of patronage or family networks, or by the interaction groups having diverse interests which, on many occasions, joined the two sides of the Atlantic, it is not su fficient to general binary simple opposition colonizer-colonized can leave a substantial part of the human relationships typical of the Old Regime in the Americas outside our attentional focus. Finally, as is the case with the word \"State, \" whether it is appropriate to use the term will ultimate ly depend on the meanings and conno- 105 On the need to study the history of the Nation in Spain and also of the Americas from this municipal perspective rather than from the history of the kingdoms or of the forma- tion of the State, an author who has attracted attention, among others, is Tamar Herzog. A good example of the possibilities of this approach is H erzog (2003). Revisiting the America's Colonial Status under the Spanish Monarchy 67tations the historian gives it. In this respect, it is possible to use the word colony orcolonial while preserving the political logic characteristic of the Monarchy during the Old Regime. We would be dealing, in any case, with not very \"colonial\" colonies.

The Questions In 1648, analyzing the titles that Spain may have to the New World, Sol\u00f3r- zano Pereira advanced the theory that these depended on its vassals rst having \"searched, found and occupied\" the territory. Although the American continent was not truly a no it, leaving it uncultivated. \" Natural law and the law of nations, as well as the practice \"in all the provinces of this world\" instructed this abandoned land to be given to the Spaniards in reward for their \"industry. \" 1 Some forty years later, in 1690, in his \"Two Treatises of Government, \" John Locke also sustained that property and industry were tied together. Those who cultivated a land that had been abandoned or was insu fficiently worked, by mixing their labor with the earth created a new object to which 1Sol\u00f3rzano Pereira (1972), book I, chapter IX, points 12 y 13. The original version reads: \"y verdaderamente para las islas y tierras que hallaron por ocupar y poblar de otras gentes, o ya porque nunca antes las hubiesen habitado o porque si las habitaron se pasaron a otras y las dejaron incultas, no se puede negar que lo sea y de los m\u00e1s conocidos por el derecho n a t u r a lyd et o d a sl a sg e n t e s ,q u ed i e r o ne s t ep r e m i oai n d u s t r i ayq u i s i e r o nq u el ol i b r e cediese a los que primero lo hallasen y ocupasen y as\u00ed se fue practicando en todas las provincias del mundo, como a cada paso nos lo ense\u00f1a Arist\u00f3teles, Cicer\u00f3n, nuestros jurisconsultos y sus glosadores\" and \"los lugares desiertos e incultos quedan en la libertad natural y son del que primero los ocupa en premio de su industria. \" In the seventeenth century, \"industria\" was identi ed as \"the diligence and easiness in which one does some- thing with less work than others. \" With a comparative perspective in mind, it designated those who knew better and performed better: C ovarruias Orozco (1995), 666. It is possible, however, that by the mid-eighteenth century it came to designate simply \"a mastery or an ability in any art or profession:\" Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola (1732), Dicciona- rio de la lengua castellana, 258. Did European Law Turn American? 75they had now acquired title.2This entitlement, Locke argued, harmed no one. After all, a land that had been abandoned or was insu fficiently culti- vated was a land that no one truly needed. Applying this theory to the Americas, Locke concluded that, because Native-Americans did not improve the land (nor did they mix their industry with it), they had no title to it, nor could they prohibit its occupation and use by others. By 1758, both these theories were enshrined as doctrines of the Law of Nations (and thus of nascent international law). Emmer de Vattel, who them in his recompilation, also insisted that cultivating the land was an obligation imposed upon man by nature, that all nations were bound by natural law to labor the territory that they occupied, and that those who did not \"failed in their duty to themselves, injured their neighbors and deserved to be exterminated like wild beasts of prey. \" No one, he concluded, could \"take to themselves more land than they have need of or can inhabit and cultivate, \" and no one \"may complain if other more industrious nations, too conned at home, should come and occupy part of their land. \" 3 Most scholars have assumed that these developments marked an Ameri- to European (now also international) law. They pointed out that both Sol\u00f3rzano and Locke were deeply engaged in the \"European Expansion, \" and both sought to legitimate what their countries were doing overseas. While Sol\u00f3rzano was a colonial judge working in Lima, Locke was a lawyer that, although living in the Old Continent, represented colonial interests. 4Vattel, who had made these theories part of a coherent body of law, may have had no commitment to colonialism per se, but his dedication to both philosophy and diplomacy geared him to search for a clear statement of what he thought was (or ought to be) the legal norms of his time. Scholars have also insisted that these developments demonstrated the contribution of the Americas to the consolidation of private property. It was rst in the Americas, they sustained, that property was not only sancti ed, but was also made a-historical. 5 Part of a transatlantic conversation taking in the seventeenth and eighteenth points 3Vattel I, chapters VIII and XVIII, 37-38 and 85-86. 4Arneil (1996) and rmitage (2004). 5Larkin 1-52. 76 Tamar Herzogthe relations between Early Modern European and American law. We already know that European law crossed the Atlantic and, in the process, also gained ground as an international law of sorts. We also know that it was constructed in a multilog between various actors working from di fferent national traditions. But to what degree was this European law American-ized? Was there, indeed, a derecho indiano, as Spanish scholars have named the process of European law having looking at these questions by observing both sides of the Ocean, centering not on how these theories had evolved, but instead on how some of their tenants were de facto implemented in both the Old and the New world. II. The Spanish-American Observatory Ideas linking use (mainly cultivation) to rights were clear in Spanish Amer-ica as early as the sixteenth and others as vacant and thus open for colonization. The jurisdiction of the audiencia of Quito (present day Ecuador and southern Colombia) may serve as an example. Studying land litigation in Quito clari es that, follow- ing royal instructions, Spanish judges were willing to recognize the right of native communities to the \"land of ancestors. \" 6However, authorized process to native dispossession, which histor-ians have since lamented. 7 As I have argued elsewhere in greater detail, recognition of ancestral rights did not guarantee continuity.8Instead, it introduced major changes in the way native rights were both de ned and defended. The reason for this mutation was simple: Indigenous communities who wanted their right to land recognized by the Spaniards had to address the colonial courts. In Quito, at least, these courts responded to these (1986) and A dorno (2007). 7O tsCapdequi (1959) 82 and 85 and G onz\u00e1lez Rodr\u00edguez (1990) 171-198. 8H erzog (2013) and (2014) criteria.9Rather than being interested in reconstructing what had happened in the past, or what an Indigenous, pre-Colonial law- may have recognized and mandated, these judges affirmed, time and again, that the only test for the existence of rights was occupation. and continuous use. In most cases, they equated \"use\" with rights to the territory. Hunting, on the contrary, never was. Spanish judges thus asked who was present on the land, what they were doing and not what title they held. They favored sedentary communities over others who used the terri-tories in other ways and, subjecting rights to \"actual use, \" they required that all natives continuously use the land, arguing that unless they did, territory could never be recognized as their own. The accumulation of all these factors guaranteed that in the the pre-colonial period, they created and gave others were completely new. The judges, however, were only complementing what the king was doing too. During the colonial period, the Crown to new or resettled indigenous in all these cases, land granted to natives was not considered their own. According to the law, this land was royal property ( realengo ) and it was to remain in native hands only 9 Documentation regarding land claims in the audiencia of Quito was mostly found in sections titled especial, casas and gobierno. Additional documentation proceeds from the Spanish colonial archives in Seville (Archivo General de Indias, herea fter AGI) and the Biblioteca de la Real Academia de la Historia in Madrid (herea fter BRAH/M). See, for example, the questionaire cacique de 12r-13r on 12v and the provision to corregidor of R\u00edobamba, Quito, 16/8/1649, ANQ, Ind\u00edgenas exp. 2 1r-4r, 2r. 10 erzog (2007). an older bibliography on these issues see M \u00e1laga Medina (1974) and Solano (1976).

The legal reasoning that Sol\u00f3rzano, Locke,Vattel, and the judges of Quito of Indigenous peoples by arguing operate the American interior. Although the Spaniards and invoked papal bulls and bilateral treaties in their relationship with one another, the histor-ical documentation generated on the border itself demonstrates that both parties were mostly obsessed with the question who was where and what they were doing. 13Discovery and exploration - that is, the initial and early arrival to the territory - were important in such discussions regarding land 11 Petition of the de indios , Quito 9/11/1791, ANQ, 3, exp.

The particular status of such lands was described in Sol\u00f3rzano Pereira (1972) 379-380. 12 Latin American composiciones were studied by many. See, for example, T orales Pacheco (1990) and A mado Gonz\u00e1lez (1998). Also see Recopilaci\u00f3n de Indias, book 4, title 12, laws 15-21.

The nucleated nature of the territory that the Spaniards and the Portuguese both possessed came into focus, for example, during discussions involving Colonia de Sacramento (in present day Colonia was built, destroyed, rebuilt, taken again, and eighteenth centuries.

They had to ensure that territory was theirs would be used and to certify that their rivals shied away from it, as well as from any new area. If the rivals did not, expressing protest was crucial because the lack of a response could be legally constructed and comprehended (by way of legal presumption) as consent. Conflict regarding use, however, was not limited to land. Both the Span- iards and the Portuguese understood that controlling the local a means to control the territory.

Repopulation campaigns made two issues clear. First, most individuals and groups who requested permission fficiently usually argued that arable agriculture was possible, was a waste. 40According to them, grazing did not improve the land, nor did it ensure that its potential would be met. Land dedicated to pasture was not only wasteful, it was also dangerous. Uncultivated and le ftin a state of nature, it served as refuge for dangerous people and wild animals, even disease. 41Leaving land in this barren state, they argued, was never an informed decision. On the contrary, it was mainly due to neglect, willful and at times even criminal. 42 If the rst point of almost general agreeme nt was criticism of grazing, the second was the allegation that improving the land by making it achieve its (true) potential was not a choice but an obligation. Tying the reform of land to the reform of its people, improvement would ensure that, through access became arid to the point of no return.44 40 AHN, Consejos 4057, fol. 1r-4r and 6r. 41 The report written by de Olavide, Seville, 20/11/1773, AHN, Consejos 4048, 6r-9r Contemporary documentation does clarify, however, that some elds may have been abandoned as a result of the \"di fficulties of the time, \" or AHN, Consejos 4047 and petition of the \"lugares de las valles de Broto y Tena ...\" undated, Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid (herea fter BNE) VE/200/11. 43 Petition of Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, Madrid, 23/11/1798, AHN, Consejos 4061 n. 2 and AHN, Consejos 4061 n. 13, fols. 6r-9r. 44 A rriquibar (1779) 238-239 and la Real Sociedad Matritense de Amigos del Pa\u00eds en 1780 according to: Archives of the Real Sociedad Matritense de Amigos del Pa\u00eds (herea fter RSMAP) 37/1. 86 Tamar HerzogCultivating \"45 Who was best debated tended argue that the poor certainly were not.

However, Sp ain was not the only European country in which these issues played a major role the where Locke wrote his essays, is another example. From as early as the sixteenth century and more clearly in the three results, they have coincided that during this period many lands previously considered public were made private through a process that they termed \"enclosure. \" According to them, economic pressures led to the fenc- ing of lands, on the one hand, which demanded a more e fficient usage, on the other. 54Contemporary, was a new ideology that connected property to 51 The original version reads: \"pues ni han tenido ni tienen ni pueden tener por el orden regular en ellas m\u00e1s utilidad, que lo que pudieran gurarse en unas posesiones situadas en los espacios imaginarios. \" A rriquibar (1779) 236. 52 J ovellanos (1795) 8 and 12-13. 53 S later (1907) and T awney enclosure a sign of absence of improvement and thus the lack of title or property: A rneil (1996) 62. 88 Tamar Herzogimprovement, arguing that only those su fficiently knowledgeable and capa- ble of making the land truly pro t a b l es h o u l db ea l l o w e dt oh o l di t .T i e dt o the commercialization of agriculture and to a general attack on both public and communal land-holding (making private property a social and political ideal), these processes led to the dispossession of many individuals, families controversial measure that many criticized. 55They debated its political, economic, social and legal wisdom and asked whether it was bene cial, to to extent.

Conclusions In the Americas as in Europe, by the late sixteenth century and clearly in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the right to land was tied to its \"prop-er use. \" What proper use meant could be endlessly debated, but it was clearly the case that in both England and Spain, as well as in the Old and the New 59 N eeson (1993) 30 and B race (2001) 16-17.

By the end of this process, not only were some Native- American and Europeans dispossessed, but this dispossession was presented as their own fault. It was a punishment of sorts for their own neglect, a means to force them to improve their ways and become \" Although commonalities existed, seen as an individualistic endeavor in England; in Spain and overseas it had stronger communal overtones as many believed that it would only happen through the formation of new or the conservation of old commun- ities. Yet, despite these di fferences, the fact property was not always immediately transformed in Spain, eventually in all three places (England, Spain, and Spanish America) indigenous communal property ended up in the hands One feature that tied all these questions together was the constant debate unleashed on both sides of the Ocean on how to reorganize land regimes in ways that seemed more \"reasonable\" Whether \"reason-ableness\" was the motive or the excuse we will never know - it is probable that both were equally present - but, regardless, it is clear debating rights, what contemporaries did was to discuss how to change them, how to undermine them, or how to relinquish them altogether. It was as if they were willing to reinvent the social contract and the legal basis for ownership by putting a new spin on existing theories. This was an important development within a society (still) marked by tradition and in which, for centuries, the right to land depended on the passage of time. Now, instead of \"historical rights\" what mattered was a certain \"public utility. \" amnesia, in short, was equally present on both sides of the Ocean, although its results may have di ffered according to place and time. Tabula rasa was not an American invention; it was tied to a process we now identify as \"modernity. \" It is thus debatable whether England had indeed developed a particular discourse that, contrary to other European nations, focused \"on the possession of territory to the exclu- sion of its inhabitants\" and had passed on the present than the past, however, may have been particularly useful in the Americas, as it allowed ignoring of previous occupiers; nonetheless, it in Europe. growing notion of sovereignty and royal responsibility, it imagined a modernizing class leading the rest of humanity (mainly indigenous and the than Americanized, law was modernized.

The inability to distinguish European process. Although some institutions, laws and doctrines found a more fertile ground on one side of the Atlantic versus the other, the constant dialog between both and the continuous in flux of ideas and practices made these worlds to some degree united. Practices experimented in Europe were implemented in the Americas, while also influencing the Old World. Success or failure in one could be detrimental to the experiment on the other side, but exact genealogies are hard, perhaps even the Americas appeared almost as a platform on which ideas about Europe were debated. On others, it was a cause and a reason to reconsider old truths. But whatever the precise dynamics may have been, this continuous conversation ensured that the law constantly changed. Under the guise of 62And, although innovations could be the result of an encounter with new circumstances, more oft en than not and as usually happens with law and legal change, they included new visions and new ways of interpreting the existing canon. 62 M ariluz Urquijo (1976) 389-402. 92 Tamar HerzogBibliography Adorno ,Rolena (2007), The Polemics of Possession in Spanish American narrative, New Haven Amado Gonz\u00e1lez ,Donato (1998), Reparto de tierras ind\u00edgenas y la primera visita y composici\u00f3n general, 1591-1595, in: Hist\u00f3rica 22,2, 197-207 Armitage ,David (2004), John Locke, Carolina and the Two Treatises of Govern- ment, in: Political Theory 32,5, 602-627 Arneil ,Barbara (1996), John Locke and America.

Period Introduction: Legal Globalization in the Early Modern European law was the primary vehicle and export product of early modern globalization. European law spread with the Spaniards to Central and South America, and the Philippines; with the Portuguese to Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Goa, and Macao; with the Dutch to Ceylon and Indonesia; with the French to Quebec and Louisiana; with the British to North Amer- ica, Australia, and countless other p laces around the world; and even with the Danes to the islands of St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix. Expansion was nothing new to European law at the outset of the modern age. European law had already expanded continuously pari passu with the e x p a n s i o no ft h eR o m a nE m p i r e ,a n da g a i na fter Roman law was revived in late eleventh century Bologna. The medieval expansion had meant that the learned bodies of law, Roman and canon, traveled from the southern parts of Europe to the north, from the western parts to the east, and from the cities to the countryside. Roman law traveled with the learned jurist, canon law with the Catholic Church and its churchmen. 2 1Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereyra (1648) IV .XVI.3, 260.

The Westernization of Police Regulation 97To portray Euro- centered. It is of course true that European law has not been the only body of law expanding in the pre-modern world. Islamic law went through a period of rapid expansion from the seventh century onwards. The solutions that the Islamic legal experts had developed, building on the heritage of the Semitic cultures of the Near East, were quickly absorbed not only in the cradle of the religion for commercial needs, but also in large areas of North Africa and Central Asia, to where Islam spread. 3Chinese law, especially the Confucian concept of li, has traditionally exercised in fluence in large areas of the Far East.4The same questions that I will ask about European law in this article could certainly be asked of Islamic and Chinese laws as well. However, it remains fairly clear that of all of these expanding laws of the medieval and early modern periods European law had m ost success in extending its sphere of infl uence around the measured by sheer geography. The term globalization, irritating s l o g a na si th a sb e c o m ef o rm a n y ,c a nb e called into question. No globalization has so far been complete in geograph- terms - not even the present-day iteration based mainly on the law of the United States of America. Large tracts of the globe have always been le ft untouched, and even the picture of large tracts being completely dominated by extending bodies of inspection indeed almost always does. The learned ius commune applied in the emerging high courts of Europe in the early modern period was not the same as the law applied in remote local courts dominated by naturally even clearer if one compares the audiencias of Spanish America to the jungles of Amazonia. Despite the unquestionable de ciencies in expresses legal mere isolated legal institutions, not linked to any wholesale cultural transfer, floating around the globe. The dimensio ns of legal transfer are certainly completely di fferent if we take the Swedish-Danish institution of the om- budsman as an example of an isolated legal transfer, comparing it with whole 3 On the early expansion of Islam and its connection to the preceding cultures of the Near East, see H allaq (2005) 8-28. 4 Chongko Choi even speaks of East Asian ius commune; see Choi (2009). 5 Sweden is the particular case I have in mind. 98 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kibodies of law being taken from one continent to another. We need to have a name for the larger phenomenon, and legal globalization is such a name. Legal globalization, however, is not more than a huge legal transfer, and is subject to similar theoretical ponderings as the more limited legal transfers. It is a truism that all transfers change when adapted to new circumstances, and the new outcome looks di fferent than the one. its new circumstances unavoidably in fluences the that the transfer scholars and comparative legal historians have written aspects legal transplants: what rules are carried over and borrowed by other jurisdictions and how legal rules change process. However, legal historians surprisingly little conditions which cause transplants to change and, accordingly, how they change. The methods of legal change themselves can sometimes be understood as legal transfer, however. The main contention of this article is that both the Spanish and the British colonizers of America made ample use of one such technique, early modern police regulations. The spread of police regulation to the New World led to globalization or at least thorough Westernization of this merely a technique. Although they covered a wide array of regulations, they did not cover everything. Police regulations were about administration, commerce, security, health, and cen-sorship, but they were much less about contract law, rules of evidence, or punishment. I will start with some theoretical considerations regarding the concepts of European and Spanish colonial law (Section II). Section III, the main part of the article, will discuss the main themes in regard to which Spanish colonial law developed di fferent solutions in comparison with its peninsular Spanish legal order(s). In Section IV , I will then attempt to explain these di fferences, comparing Spanish colonial law with that of the British North American colonies. Section V sums up the essential points of the article. The Westernization of Police Regulation 99II. Globalization of Law which tend to create and consolidate a world economy, a single ecological system, and a complex network of communications that covers the whole globe, even if does penetrate every corner of it. \" 6The diffusion of Western law with early modern colonization not only ts the concept of globalization well, but also can in fact be taken as one of its primary examples. The concept of Western law still requires some discussion. What later became Western law - a term that Harold Berman made universally known - was the same as European law or ius commune , the learned law consisting of Roman and canon law at t h eb e g i n n i n go ft h ee a r l ym o d e r np e r i o d .E u r o p e a nl a w ,b yt h et i m et h e overseas conquests began, was already falling into regional subcategories because of the contact that ius commune made with particular local laws.7 The idea of Castilian regents was to incorporate Roman legal texts into written statutes (most notably the Siete Partidas of Alfonso X the Wise) and prevent the use of Roman law otherwise. How successful this was is disputed.8In any case, the derecho com\u00fan of Castile was clearly one of the 6Twining (2000) 4. Twining's concept of globalization is, however, not historically very sensitive. Duncan Kennedy has, contrast, the of globalization of globalization in the West: the period of classical legal thought (ca. 1850-1914), the period of socially oriented legal thought and analysis, neoformalism, and adjudica-tion\" (1945-). See K ennedy (2006). 7 Many legal historians, most recently Patrick Glenn, in fact deny the commune consisting of Roman law never existed, but that it always appeared as regional variants only - gemeines Recht and Derecho com\u00fan , See (2005) 42-43. Other existence truly been by (2000) 724; and eirbaut (2003) views very di fferent from tradi- tional ones represented by Francesco Calasso, Coing Manlio Bellomo. As a Nordic legal historian, the author of the present article cannot help but agree with the critical voices. However, the localized variants of ius commune had much to do with each other. The overarching learned la w was practically the same everywhere, but since the local laws were di fferent (written or not), the overall combination of the two (or more) layers of law turned out di fferently. 8 Again, opinions diverge as to whether the Siete Partidas amounted to a \"Spanish common law, \" or whether the law book of Alfonso X was the highest layer of ius proprium ,a b o v e which the pan-European ius commune still existed. See B arrientos the essential of both civil and procedural law with other variants of the European ius commune .T h i s Spanish variant of European law served as the basis and bridge for what came to constitute the law for Spanish America from 1492 onwards. We still have one more terminological hurdle to cross, the term \"Spanish colonial law. \" Derecho indiano is the term most frequently used in Spanish to denote the legal system in force in the Spanish colonies during the early modern period. Like all geographical ways of limiting law, which is essen- tially a shi fting phenomenon, so derecho indiano is also not a natural entity, but was created at a particular time and place. In this case, the term was put into historiographical use in the early twentieth century as part of the His-panist ideology of that period. 9Like all geographical de nitions of law, derecho indiano is helpful in distinguishing and pointing out a particular area of study from other such areas. However, by highlighting its particu-larity, derecho indiano also tends to conceal connections that the law in Spanish America had with Spanish and other European law. In this way, it does not diff er from \"European\" or \"Nordic\" law. Like any national legal history, the research tradition of derecho indiano has tended to highlight its particularity instead of denoting its similarities (or di fferences) with other colonial systems or European law. In other words, comparative studies on Spanish years. 10This create an illusion of uniqueness of national (or quasi-nation- al, such as derecho indiano ) legal systems. Comparative studies tend to dimin- i s hs u c hi l l u s i o n s . This article challenges the uniqueness of Spanish colonial law in two respects. First, I wish to claim that Spanish colonial law was just one variant of European and Spanish law. Second, Spanish colonial law was only one version of colonial legal orders. Therefore, it can and should be approached 9S e e P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2010). 10 In this respect, Spanish colonial law is not di fferent from the mainstream legal history on any of the discipline's sub elds. R oss's article (2008a) is a notable exception, and I have myself authored a few articles in which derecho indiano is compared to European law from various aspects. See P ihlajam\u00e4ki (1997); P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2002) and (2004). 11 avies (1973); E lliott (1970); of Police Regulation 101in the global context of the expansion of European law to other continents. This does not mean that derecho indiano should not be used as an object of study - this article is doing just that, of course. Instead, scholars should be aware of the position of Spanish colonial law within a global context. It is necessary to understand that the concept of derecho indiano is essentially modern, created by legal historians trained in the period of national positive law. In this respect, it is no diff erent from concepts like European, Nordic, or Far Eastern law. To portray Spanish colonial law as a separate or quasi-sep-arate system of law would not have occurred to early modern Castilian or criollo legal professionals operating under the auspices of the Castilian Crown. I will now turn to the modern de nitions of Spanish colonial law. III. What was Spanish colonial law? The Spanish Crown was quick to organize the administration of its overseas territories in America. Formally speaking, the Indies were incorporated into the Castilian Crown, although the Castilian kings were also the kings of Aragon. Because the American territories were incorporated as a conquered territory, it was up to the Castilian Crown to organize their administration without or representative assembly, was ever introduced on the American side of the Atlantic.12 The legal order that regulated life in the colonies was basically Castilian law. This was based on the Partidas , a thirteenth century compilation heavily in fluenced by Roman and canon law later supplemented by royal regulation and court practice. The on ius commune inevi- tably in fluenced Castilian law well.Vigorous development by way of royal regulation was precisely what the early modern monarchs engaged in to gain increasing control of their lands. This royal legislation was police regulation. According to a formal de nition, Spanish colonial law was a \"compound of legal rules applicable in the Indies, that is, in the American, Asian and Oceanic territories dominated by Spain. \" Spanish colonial law can therefore be divided into a. norms speci cally created for Indies 120-122. Elliott observes, however, that the institutional authority had not become as important during the Middle Ages in Castile as they had in Aragon. 102 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kipropiamente tal o municipal ); b. Castilian law ( derecho castellano ), which was used if \"proper derecho indiano \" did contain the normative solution needed; and c. Indian law ( derecho ind\u00edgena ) ,o rt h el a wo ft h ea b o r i g i n a l s .13In addition to secular norms, we can also speak of the canon law of the Spanish colonies ( derecho indiano canonico )a st h ec a n o nl a wi nf o r c ei nS p a n i s h America.14These de nitions reveal that \"proper\" Spanish colonial law stood in relation to Castilian law, used as a subsidiary body of law whenever derecho indiano c o u l dn o tp r o v i d ea na n s w e r .T h es a m ea p p l i e st ot h ec a n o n law of Spanish America and canon law in general. When did derecho indiano propiamente tal ,S p a n i s hc o l o n i a ll a wi nt h e narrow sense of the term, not provide an swers for legal problems? And when it did, what was Spanish colonial law \"properly speaking\"? Technical de - nitions do not take a stand on what kinds of rules \"Spanish colonial law properly speaking\" consisted contain rules, especially if customary law is taken into consideration, but in practice it did not. If we want to set Spanish colonial law into a comparative context, we cannot avoid looking 15 Some modern authors have given descriptions of Spanish colo- nial law. Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, one of the grand old men of the eld denes derecho indiano as \"a system of law, doctrines, and customs, created or accepted by the Castilian kings, in order to organize the spiritual or secular government of the Hispanic New World, regulate the condition of its inhab- itants, direct navigation and and, above all, ensure the incorpo-ration of faith. \" 16Anyone acquainting them- selves with the literature on Spanish colonial law cannot help noticing the heavy accent on these and other issues, and the lack of literature on others. Collections of papers issued regularly as a result of the conferences organized by the Institute of the History of Spanish Colonial Law ( Instituto de Historia 13 \"[E]l conjunto de reglas jur\u00eddicas aplicables en Indias, o sea, los territorios de Am \u00e9rica, Asia y Ocean\u00eda dominados por Espa\u00f1a. \" D ougnac Rodr\u00edguez (1994) 11. 14 See D uve(2008). 15 This is not to exclude local norm-giving, which occurred in all parts of Spanish America and at various levels of its administration. 16 Z orraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa22 (1994) The Westernization of Police Regulation 103del Derecho Indiano ) are a good way of obtaining an overview of what india- nistas have produced - and what they have not been so interested in.17 The Conference papers show a heavy emphasis on such as constitutional and administrative law, ecclesiastical law, mining law and water law. Much has also been written on the administrative institutions (such as cabildos and audiencias ) and feudal law (such as encomienda ). Considerably less has been written on the private law, criminal law, and procedural Law of the Indies. The scholarship on the history of private law in the Indies has tended to stress Spanish colonial law as part of the European ius commune . Much the same can be said about the literature on criminal and procedural law.18 The reason for the scarcity of scholarship in some elds and the concen- tration mostly the regulation treatment in the Indies. Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa's de nition of derecho indiano above hints at this trend, which I have treated in more detail elsewhere; namely, that much of derecho indiano propiamente dicho i si nf a c tf u n c t i o n a l l yt h es a m et y p eo f legislation which has been called \"police law\" ) in recent international legal his- toriography. Police law in the early modern sense of the word refers to the legislative activity of an early modern state, which organizes its with statutes, of pour- ing from the chanceries of early modern kingdoms, towns, and other legis-lating that of good government, Staatsr\u00e4son orraison A r e a sa sd i fferent as religion, security and public order, agriculture, industry and commerce, tra ffic, construction, culture and sciences, as well as the control of the poor and the marginalized, needed detailed legislation.19In these various to create and maintain public order, discipline and stability, but at the same time promote 17 The Conferences have been organized at intervals of 2-4 years since 1966 in either His- panic America or peninsular Spain. 18 See, for instance, the conference proceedings mentioned above, note 10 (P ihlajam\u00e4ki ). 19 decades, the literature on police has grown immensely, and no comprehensive list is worth attempting here. See, for instance, S tolleis (1993), H \u00e4rter /Stolleis (1996) and ordinances in the reformed parts of Europe came very close to police ordinances. In some parts of Europe, such as police regulation is thus closely linked to the rise of the modern state and modern absolutism. Spain was no exception to this general European tendency. Johannes-Michael Scholz has noted that the Spanish legislator's interest in police matters grew considerably between the Nueva Recopilaci\u00f3n of 1640 and the Nov\u00edsima Recopilaci\u00f3n of 1805.22Police law was the most modern regulatory tool that the early modern prince aiming at absolute power had at his disposal, although one has to bear in mind that the effectiveness of police regulation o ften leftmuch to be desired. Although police law the monarch, its legitimating ideology also imposed limits on the the regulations could only be used to further the common good, the bonum commune . From the very beginning of the conquest, the Spanish Crown issued a large number of statutes to regulate life in the Indies. The jurist Antonio Le\u00f3n Pinelo is said to have extracted the thousands of royal c\u00e9dulas that made up the Recopilaci\u00f3n de las leyes de Indias , a compilation of statutes printed in 1680 but in 1635, from approximately 400,000 laws.23The laws tended to govern every ften extremely tended to be. as examples of the areas governed,\"the xing of prices, the ferry charge on the river at Santo Domingo, the right to own shing boats, permission to import from Spain cattle and foodstu ffs necessary for the subsistence of the new overseas communities, the right to engage in local trade with nearby settlements, or for such a trade; exact manner in which a town must be laid out, the width of the streets and their direction in relation to the sun, the size and subdivision of the city blocks, the location of the church and the town hall. \" 24Religious matters could with good reason be 20 H \u00e4rter (1993) 62-63. 21 On the di fferent concepts of police in relation to ecclesiastical administration, especially in Germany, see S tolleis (1992) 250. 22 See S cholz (1996) 230-231. 23 H aring (1947) 113. Haring says that the nalRecopilaci\u00f3n contains 6400 c\u00e9dulas ,w h e r e a s more recent scholarship mentions the gure 7308; see D ougnac (1994) 11. 24 H aring (1947) 120-121. The Westernization of Police Regulation 105added to list, making it look like a rather typical catalog of police regulation in any region of the early modern Western world. The amount of legislation was indeed such that it soon started to call for some sort of general presentation. Both compilations and literature started to appear to meet this need. Of the scholars in the eld, the most famous was Juan Sol \u00f3rzano Pereira, who was a judge of the Audiencia of Lima. The leading derecho indiano author of the colonial period, Sol \u00f3rzano's major work, Pol\u00edtica Indiana (1648), deals with \"the law and the government par- ticular to the Indies\" ( Derecho y Gobierno particular de las Indias ).25 The work is divided into six \"books, \" which deal with the discovery of America (I), the social position of the aborigines (book II), the creoles as landowners (book III), ecclesiastical government (book IV), as well as administrative (book V) and economic organization (book VI) of the Indies. The general plan of the book reveals that Sol \u00f3rzano's pol\u00edtica was essentially similar to European police regulations. In the second book, chapters I-XXIV are about the \"personal services\" of the construction are all central to the Euro-pean ius politiae . Because we dealing major areas of law such as private, criminal, and procedural law. The law in these areas by and large followed Castilian law, which, in turn, was just one version of the European ius commune . The huge amount of the laws was also compiled, rst as private initiatives, then as more o fficial ones as well. The cedulario (register of royal laws and decrees) of Vasco de Puga, judge of the New Mexico audiencia ,w a sp r i n t e da s early as the 1560s. The registers proved used them as material. Antonio Le \u00f3nP i n e l o ,a sm e n - tioned above, bore the main burden of compiling the major general collec- tion of laws of the laws of the Indies. The work took place under the super- vision of rst Rodrigo de Aguiar y Acu\u00f1a and then Juan Sol \u00f3rzano Pereira. 25 S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereyra (1648) I.I.1, 22. The work rst appeared in Latin as De indianum iurein 1629. , cabildos , and other major gures of the Spanish colonial administration.26 The Recopilaci\u00f3n is divided into nine books, which include - roughly speaking - ecclesiastical government (I), matters concerning the Council of the Indies and audiencias (II), political and military administration, vice- roys, and captains-general (III), the legal foundation of colonization (IV), provincial government (V), Indians (VI), criminal law (VII), the royal ex- chequer (VIII), and commerce and navigation (IX).27The titles of the books are quite telling of the contents of the compilation and thus of Spanish colonial law itself, since the material included in Pinelo's compilation con-centrates heavily on the administration of various Book VII, the provisions of which share elements of penal law, is by far the shortest and far from intended as a comprehensive criminal code. Its eight headings include regulations on judges problems resulting from husbands being away from their wives in America (3), vagabonds and gypsies (4), the black people and those of mixed race (5), prisons (6), prison inspections (7), and crimes and punish- ments (8). Most of the titles thus again deal with matters of typical police regulation. Criminal law as such is not the point here, not even in heading 8 on crimes and punishment, the 29 laws of which are really a haphazard collection of regulations concerning matters of particular concern for the Crown in the colonies. For instance, law 11 of heading 8 requires that those sentenced to the gallie should be sent to Cartagena or Tierra rme to serve their sentences. According to law 15, the judges ought not to the legal punishment - which was probably also customary in America as else-where in the 17 established should refrain from accepting settlements except in \"very special cases, at the request and wish of the parties, and if the case was such that it [did] not require satisfaction to the public cause. \" The examples are numerous, but I think the point is clear: Book VII is no penal code in the sense of Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (1532) or Ordon- nance de Villers-Cotter\u00eats (1539), but rather a collection of rules not capable of functioning without the general background of Spanish penal and proce- 26 H aring (1947) 113. 27 The Recopilaci\u00f3n is now conveniently available on the Internet, http://www.congreso. gob.pe/ntley/LeyIndiaP .htm.

I will take one more example of the Spanish colonial legislation from a particular part of the Spanish colonies, for which the catalogues of statutes have recently been published, R\u00edo de la Plata (1534-1717), Charcas (1563-1717), and Tucum\u00e1n and Paraguay (1573-1716). The great majority of statutes catalogued in these registries can, hardly surprisingly considering what has been said above, be classi ed as police law. Some of the statutes deal with administration, religion and the protection of aborigines. A vast majority, however, has to do with the economy and the military. 28Again, criminal, procedural, and private law remain only sporadically regulated. The precise character of police regulation as \"law\" is not clear either. Police regulations were, for instance, le ftout of the Swedish Law of the Realm of 1734, a compilation of laws otherwise thought perfect un-changeable. The natural designed exclusion of police regulations because of their mutable character. Was derecho indiano really considered law, in the natural law understand- ing of the word? At least the name of the original Latin version of Pol\u00edtica Indiana ,De indianum iure , suggests as much, although the title of the Span- ish translation seems to convey that we are moving in the borderlands of law and more practical regulation. Another essential and specicc h a r a c t e r i s t i co f Spanish colonial law o ften mentioned in the literature is its changing char- acter. The law adapts Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui, more consolidated \" 29In his Casuismo y sistema (1992), Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui shows how the notion of the mutability of the Indian world became common currency at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and remained so all through the Spanish conquest. 30Gaspar de Villarroel, one of the leading American legal scholars of the seventeenth century wrote that \"it is impossible that in this new world the government were rm and stable, and that the laws were 28 See Libros registros-cedularios del R\u00edo de la Plata I-III (1534-1717) (1573-1716) (2000); and P ihlajam\u00e4ki (2002). 29 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992) 30 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992) 108-114. 108 Heikki because there is such a large number of particularities, in the cure of which the laws assist, the human animal varies so much that today he is disturbed by the same medicine that healed him yesterday. \"31 The changing nature of Spanish colonial law also goes hand in hand with t h ec h a n g i n gn a t u r eo fp o l i c el a wi ng e n e r a l .T h en e e df o rc o n s t a n ta n d rapid change was even greater in the distant American lands, which were not only remote but also internally disparate. modern institution without compliance, \" the inheritance of medieval Castilian law, came to serve much the same goal of constantly accommodating legis-lation to local needs. 32 The whole legislative ideology changed in the modern era. In the middle ages, legislation, at least in theory, had not created new law but only fol-lowed tradition. In the absolutist state, all this necessarily ended: from now on, the sovereign's command was law. Law could be changed anytime and basically in any way the sovereign wished, as long as he respected the limits of natural law and the law of God, and as long as his commands worked in favor of the common good. This type of legislation, as Stolleis has remarked, could was lacking \"scienti c coherence. \" In this sense, a police statute was in fact closer to the individual command of the sovereign than to a law intended to statutes were not taught in law faculties o ft h eu n i v e r s i t i e su n t i lt h en i n e t e e n t hc e n t u r y ,b u tr a t h e rs h o v e do v e rt o philosophical faculties. 33 In short, corresponding to the latest trend in European statutory law, Spanish colonial law was police regulation.

Derecho indiano was police law if we concentrate our observations on what was typical of derecho indiano propiamente dicho ; in other words, the parts of Spanish col- onial law which di ffered most from the compound of the laws of peninsular Spain and which were most typical of the Indies - typical in the sense that the police regulations formed the kernel of Spanish colonial law. In this respect, derecho indiano was no di ffe r e n tf r o mt h el a wi nm o s tr e g i o n so f Europe. The comparative research question that now almost automatically arises is whether the same can be said of the other colonial legal orders of the early modern period. Alternatively, are we allowed to continue to speak of derecho indiano in terms exceptionalism that until now has dominated the dis- a presumption? I these problems. IV . Comparative Aspects: British Colonial Law in North America I will now brie fly discuss the case of British colonial law in North America. The precise question is: To what extent did statutory regulation in the British American colonies resemble derecho indiano , and in what respect were the two different from each other? The point that I wish to make in this section is that one of the many ingredients that English law around 1600 shared with continental law was police regulation, and that this kind of regulation found its way into the British North American colonies as well. In developing police regulation, England was no di fferent from the German territories, Sweden, or France. In all of these polities, powers not only sometimes quantities on all walks of life. In German legal language, this kind of legislation came to be conceptualized as phenomenon, according to present scholarly under- standing, was the same everywhere. A brief look at the colonial legislation quite clearly reveals that the British colonies in North America were no exception. Why should they have been, eager as they were to utilize many other facets of English law as well? I will thus claim that it does not su ffice, as far as colonial legislation is concerned, to pay attention to the the police regulation. The emphasis that scholars have recently placed on the complex nature of English law at the inception of the colonial period in America is pivotally important. As David Thomas Konig observes, the diversity of North Amer-ican law can hardly be understood without understanding the context of early modern English law. Despite the common law's position at the courts of Westminster, English law was far from uniform. Sir Edward Coke, for instance, enumerated more including ecclesi-astical courts, manorial courts, and merchants' courts on his list. \"The reach of the central common law courts, \" according to Konig, was \"according to local forces and practices. 34It has been calculated that approximately fteen different bodies of law governed the life of an average Englishman in 1600: no wonder William Blackstone lauded \"the law hath appointed [such] a prodigious variety courts England's legal culture thus o ffered huge potential upon con- legal orders of the colonies. William explains ates ample material, or \"legal capital, \" on which multiple legal solutions could be dra fted. The legal literates made ffutt argues, and ought not to be regarded as primitive versions of metropolitan law. 36It is crucial to understand that colonial law did not turn out the way it did by force of accident. However, as far as I have been able to determine, none of the contributors to the debate have discussed one important choice that the framers of colonial law made, which links it not only to English metropolitan law but also to Spanish colonial law. 37This is the nature of North American colonial law as police regulation. 34 K onig (2008) 151; see also H B lackstone (1765-1769), 3:24, 30. 36 O ffutt (2005) 161. O ffutt's main point is that by the 1680s and 1690s \"the multiple sources that had originally nourished legal imaginations were slowly dying out. \" Instead, \"the common law [...] became virtually the only form of legal capital still flowing across the Atlantic. \" O ffutt (2005) 161-162. 37 Richard Ross, however, touches upon the subject in his comparative article on the aspect of religious discipline, drawing on Massachusetts, Genevan, and Scottish sources. See R oss has spread from Germany to other regions of early modern Europe.38Scholars have con rmed that similar regulation existed practically everywhere.39Eng- land is no exception, although little research has been done on English police regulation from the comparative point of view. This may be a result of the traditional exceptionalism and isolation of English legal history, although critical research has recently lowered the barrier between common law and civil law. 40 As far as I know, Robert von Friedeburg's article on English police reg- ulation (which he calls Ordnungsgesetzgebung ) is the the sub- Royal proclamations and parliamentary statutes were, as von Friedeburg shows, both instruments of police regulation. In the years 1485-1553, at least 437 proclamations were issued. Many of them were, however, intended to strengthen the to the dominant theory of the sixteenth century, was the leading source of law because it stemmed from Parliament. Under Thomas Cromwell, a period statutory reform was instigated, and proclamations late fteenth to early seventeenth centuries covered very much the same matters as police regulation everywhere else in Europe: commerce, luxury, clothing, health care, and the prevailing scholarly understanding, little 38 One notable exception is R aeff (1983), in which the author compares German and Rus- sian police regulations in the early modern period. In the history of police regulation, Raeff was also an early starter and could therefore not take into consideration all the research in the eld that has actually emerged only since the 1990s. 39 See the articles in Stolleis /H\u00e4rter /Schilling (1996). 40 See, for instance, Zimmermann, who has on many occasions emphasized the similarities of legal institutions on both sides of the English Channel; see, e. g., Z immermann (1993); and Freda, who has stressed the fact that not only common law but also early modern continental legal orders were very much driven by court precedents; see F reda (2009) 263-278. 41 F riedeburg (1996) 583-584. 42 F riedeburg (1996) 586. 43 See ughes (1964), (1969a) (1969b). 112 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kipractical e ffect, or at least we know little of their e ffects.44This, again, ts the general European pattern. The fact that the English police regulation can be observed from the point of view of domestic power politics of the estates and the Crown, does not, however, prevent one from the English royal proclamations and parliamentary statutes as essentially part of the same wave of police regulation that was taking over most of Europe in the early modern period. There was, no doubt, English policey .45 Written law, the actual \"codes\" included, was even more important for the colonies than for England. The colonists could not wait for the inherited common law doctrines to develop so as to meet the speci c needs of the Americans. As a text-book of American legal history says, \"England [...] had no need to consider, problem of hostile native tribes [...] Some variations were natural - they stemmed from climate or the lay of the land; others were structural, depending upon structure led still further di fferentiation. \" 46William Nelson has observed that in Virginia, the \"rulers sought to accomplish their main chore, which was to coerce labor out of the local inhabitants, through intimidation and religious utopia by recourse to the law of God, not the law of England. \" These norms took the form of statutory law, such as Dale's Code of Virginia (1611), in addition to which English customary law was also used. In the initial period of the colonization, however, English common law was not on the agenda. 47Com- mon law with all its intricacies was simply too sophisticated a tool for directing the new colonies e ffectively and, what is more, it could not func- tion without lawyers. Common law might have been, as Friedman puts it, \"somehow the norm; colonial diff erences, \"48 44 E (1965); F riedeburg (1996) 583. 45 Von Friedeburg remarks that the English language did not follow the nology 579). This does not, of course, mean that the English were not aware of the continental development or that the English \"police\" were completely di ffer- ent from its continental counterpart. 46 F riedman (1985) 37. 47 N elson (2008) 16. 48 F riedman (1985) 34. The Westernization of Police Regulation 113The common and continued enhancing their need of legal information by reading English treatises.49 The legal orders of the colonies were also controlled by the Privy Council in London, although, as Richard Ross has observed, the Council's decisions were too few to control legal life in the colonies e ffectively. The Privy Coun- cil only took relatively few cases from the colonies under consideration. In this respect, the di fference from Spanish America is clear: it was much easier for private individuals and authorities to have their cases heard in the Coun- cil of the Indies than it was for the British colonists to reach the Privy Council. 50 Even the common law turned out di fferently in America. In many cases, English legal doctrines needed to be simpli ed to suit the needs of the colonies. For instance, the writ system was not adopted as such.

The level of legal culture is still another factor, which unavoidably affected the closeness of colonial law to English law. At least around 1700, colonial legal culture was underdeveloped, as seen through the eyes of an English observer. The lawyers had received little or no training at an educa- tional institution such as the Inns of Court, had not been formally admitted to a professional organization, and lacked the social status of their English counterparts. 53 Although the colonists thus adopted the basic blueprint of English law, they did so only with many deviations from the original model. The devia-tions were typically necessary their later scarcity. The functioning of the English common law would have been unthinkable in its original form in the absence of lawyers able to master its technicalities. 49 See B ilder (1999) 83-102. 50 R oss(2008a) 118-121. 51 N elson (2008) 37. 52 N elson (1975) x. 53 See K onig (2008) 157. 114 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiNot all changes were due to the lack of lawyers, however. Some resulted from the fact that the circumstances in America were radically di fferent from those in England, where the common law doctrines had emerged. England's sixteenth century experience of extending its justice system into the Welsh and Northern marchlands, Ireland served as a background for events in Virginia and, despite di ffering circumstances between North America and Virginia, there were also many similarities leading to similar outcomes. 54 In Wales and the North, instead of a fully developed common law system, judicial power was entrusted to the local lords and their conciliar courts with a simple royal commission, which granted barons broad discretion in shap-ing justice. Hardly surprisingly, it came to look quite di fferent from the common law. The conciliar justice involved no juries. Legal proceedings were speedy, as no common law protection shielded the accused in criminal cases and because the complicated forms of the civil procedure were not As Thomas Konig observes, the Crown was forced to toler-ate these deviances from the common law as the price for maintaining at least minimal control over these areas. Later on, the same pattern emerged in Ireland, as the Tudors extended conciliar justice there, leaving the central courts at Westminster with little in fluence on the island. In Ireland, just as previously in Wales and the North, the interests of a centrally led but com-plicated common law needed to yield to a more straightforward and discre-tionary judicial power. Little externa l constraint or accountability was imposed upon any of these courts. 55 However, unlike Wales and the northern marshlands, conciliar justice failed in Ireland, largely because of the weaker status of the local magnates. Conciliar justice ultimately made way for the common law, which, better equipped as it was to secure land tenures, served the interests of English colonizers and land owners more e ffectively. 56 The rst phase of colonization in North America followed similar pat- terns. The leaders assumed and were legal administration, and they largely ignored and bypassed phase of Eight common law courts replaced the monthly courts that 54 K onig (1991). 55 K onig (1991) 72. 56 K onig (1991) 78.

In 1632, the General Assembly ordered that justice be administered \"as neere as may be, accordinge to the lawes of England. \"57 At the beginning of colonization, since it was o ften unclear which law should be principle developed over the years, according to which the laws of the colonies should not be repugnant to the English laws although di ffer- ences arising from the needs of the place and the people could arise. Mary Sarah Bilder calls this the \"transatlantic \"constitution\" was unwritten, although it sometimes found its way into legal documents. The Rhode Island Charter of 1663 expresses these princi-ples of repugnancy and not con- trary and repugnant onto, but as near as may be, agreeable to the laws of this our realm of England, considering the nature and the constitution of the place and people there.60 Until the eighteenth century, it remained unclear whether and to what extent the laws of England, the common law statutes, apply. Rhode Island's introduction statute of 1700 would be executed if the colony's own laws would not cover the case. 61English law was, in other words, given subsidiary status in a true ius commune sense of the term. Both the discretion le ftto the local magnates in charge of shaping con- ciliar justice in Wales, Northern England, and Ireland and the failure of conciliar justice in Ireland and North A merica reveal important things about how laws were transferred to colonies in the early modern period. The initial phase of legal development in the North American followed much the same pattern of simpli ed justice. The way legal orders took shape was not merely influenced by political need to allow concessions to those actually in charge of representing the political power of the Crown. 57 K onig (1991) 92. 58 B ilder (2008) 99. 59 B ilder (2004) 1. 60 B ilder (2004) 2. 61 B ilder (2008) 98-99. 116 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiThe local jus- would be The political power alignment was nevertheless only one determinant. Another was geography. Time and space both created challenges from the point of view of maintaining a genuinely English system of common law, even after the common law courts had been established in the 1630s.

Another similarity was that the local circumstances, in both parts of America, soon came to be controlled by a similar legislative technique, police regulation. If English police regulation has legislation the American which is a major divergence from Spain's relations with its overseas colonies from a comparative point of view.Taking into consideration the fact that police regulation was far from unknown in England, the scarcity of British legislation in America cannot be explained by the existence of a common law tradition. The lack of royal laws can be understood much better when observed against the context of the relative laxness of colonial practices on the British side of the Atlantic. In Spanish America, various authorities were constantly reporting on each other to the The activities of Spanish o fficials could be checked in various ways. The visita or visitation, an institution developed in medieval canon law and known in many parts of Europe, could be imposed upon an official as a result of an individual complaint to Consejo de Indias or if suspicions had otherwise arisen. At the end of his term of o ffice, every official's activities were checked as a matter of course in the residencia 62 But, as Ross remarks, \"the great distances that the Atlantic the forms of imperial governance in the Americas. The English and Spanish empires, which both spanned the Atlantic, established di fferent systems of legal communication that grew out of the dis- similar political and social contexts. \" R oss(2008a) 118. The Westernization issued legislation regarding the whole important navigation allowed the local authorities much more freedom in deciding how to run the colonies, some royal proclamation Virginia and the one forbidding the importation of tobacco from elsewhere than Virginia or the Summer Island. 66Royal proclamations, at least under James I were, however, all of them dealt se , was worked out on the spot in the colonies themselves. In line with the dual authority system of the British colonial world, by the late seventeenth century it had become clear that not only the Crown but also all colonial assemblies were entitled to dra ft, enact, and change their own laws, although they were then subject to review by the Crown. 67 Virginia's statutes are a good example of the use of statute law in the English colonies in North America, beca use Virginia's legislation was one of those imitated by the other colonies. William Hening collected Virginia's statutes from 1619 to 1823. is not the place to thoroughly survey Hening's Statutes at large .H e n n i n g ' s Statutes ll thirteen volumes, and the amount of statutory law did not show si gns of diminishing towards the end of the colonial period. Even a brief look into the index of the Statutes reveals that the Virginian statutes fall squarely into the general pattern of Western early modern police regulation. Early Virginians legislated on bastards (1657), church wardens (1642), hunting (1642), powder (1642), coinage (1645), trespassing animals (1748), weights (1748), and beggars (1755) to mention only a few of the typical areas of statutory law. They do 63 H aring (1947) 148-157. 64 E lliott (1970) 126. 65 See P riest (2008) 406-407. 66 L arkin /Hughes (1973) 500-502, 627-632. 67 B ening (1923). 118 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kinot essentially di started to develop in its own directions in both the Spanish and English colonies. Nevertheless, both were also very much gov- erned with the help of statutory law. There are, however, two major di ffer- ences between the ways in which police regulation was employed. The rst major difference is that whereas the vast majority of statutory laws the Spanish originated in Madrid, an overwhelming majority of the statutes in the English North American colonies were produced in the col-onies themselves. Both Spanish and colonizers most modern legislative technique, the policey . In both cases, some of that legislation was produced on the spot, in the colonies themselves. The second major difference between the Spanish and English colonial legal orders is that that the law in the English North American colonies grew further apart from the laws of the mother country. It seems that this was not so much due to the greater geographical diff erences or other local needs (which exists to a similar extent in both North and South America) but simply because the Spaniards were able to a leash theirs, as shown by scholars such as J. H. Elliott and Richard Ross. Another factor contributing to greater uniformity of derecho indiano as against North American law was, undoubtedly, the Castilian legislator's greater propensity towards uni were recorded the cedularios, registries kept by the local author- ities, which enhanced their usability. The greater centralization of Spanish law is also re flected in the way its laws were codi ed.

The Westernization of Police Regulation 119V . Conclusion: the Westernization of Police Regulation in Early Modern Period I have attempted above to demonstrate how the early modern colonialism took of the most modern form of contemporary techniques, police regulation, not only in practically all corners of Europe, but also everywhere in the Western world. Although it may seem self-evident and hardly revolutionary to us now, police regulation is, just like any other major legal phenomenon, a historical product developed in time and space. The amount of literature produced on codi cation, court decisions, and - as far as Europe is concerned - police regulation, shows that it is hardly insignif-icant which form law takes. The substance of American police regulation has not been given much consideration in this short piece. Such an undertaking certainly require more time and I presently have at my disposal. Police regulation was a good legal technique to import to the British colonies because it typically did not require professional lawyers as dra ftsmen or users. The English common law did, the European ius commune did, and codications have always required expertise. regulation was also quick - to extent it was also e ffective may be questionable. Just like the English, so the Spaniards also used the whole array of legal techniques available in peninsular Spain to govern their overseas territories. The traditional areas of civil, criminal, and procedural law could be trans-ported over to the Indies relatively easily with the corps of legal professionals following in the footsteps of the actual conquistadores . traditional legal techniques - scholarship, court decisions, and codes - were, however, not quick and flexible enough to master the multitude of new circumstances and peoples to which the law needed to react. Instead, the heart of Spanish colonial law, derecho indiano , also came to be based on police regulation, of which Spaniards had already gathered plenty of experience the pen- insula. Police regulation as a legislative technique was a legal transfer, and legal transfers adapt to new social and political circumstances, o ften changing while they are moved from one place to another. In at least one important respect, police regulation in Spanish America was crucially di fferent from police law in British America. In the latter colonies, the bulk of the regu-lation was flecting 120 Heikki Pihlajam\u00e4kiative independence of the British colonies from London. In the Spanish colonies, however, the majority of the regulation continued to flow from the Council of the Indies right up to the end of colonial period, thus reflecting the centralized nature of the Spanish Empire. Are we thus entitled to speak of a globalization of police regulation? This may have to await further studies on Dutch, French, and Portuguese colonial laws. At the moment, in any case, it seems fair to assume that in the early modern period, police regulation became at least thoroughly westernized.

Owensby The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies I In early September 1690, Juan Rodr\u00edguez, a royal notary, accompanied Span- iard Juan Moreno de Acevedo, owner of an obraje in Puebla, to an open eld between the Indian towns of Santa Ana Acolco and Santa B\u00e1rbara Tamasul-co, in the parish of Santa Mar\u00eda Nativitas, Tlaxcala. Rodr\u00edguez had been charged by the audiencia in Mexico City with conducting a legal ceremony that was supposed to o fficially put Moreno into possession of the land as his own. On its face, this was to have been a routine proceeding. But all did not go according to plan. The audiencia had issued its order pursuant to a lawsuit between Moreno and the residents of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara. In the late 1670s, Moreno had bought an hacienda adjoining the towns. He had then claimed certain lands as part of his purchase, towns insisted were theirs from \"time immemorial, \" as one witness put it. Indian litigants relied on two sources to bolster their assertion: a map showing the boundaries and t\u00edtulos y recaudos , or notarized documents, some in Nahuatl, dating to 1597 and establishing uncontested transmission from 1624 to 1663. Moreno had rst pressed his claim in 1679, shortly a fter buying the hacienda adjacent to the towns. In 1682 he had obtained an order from the audiencia awarding him a particular piece of land, alleging that he had bought the parcel in question. Much litigation followed over the inter-vening years. So when in early September the two Spaniards arrived at the site that Rodrig\u00faez, in his notarial capacity, had noticed and were met by a group of indignant residents from Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara, there was a long history of suspicion between parties. In their September 1690 petition writ amparo , the Indians stated that Rodr\u00edguez had noticed that the land on which they stood did not match the parcel described in the audiencia's order favoring Moreno. In the discharge of his notarial obliga- The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 125tion, Rodr\u00edguez describing Moreno's claim, boundary markers and other telltale signs, and had concluded that he could not match the description to the land on which he was standing. At that point, the two Spaniards had argued. A fter heated words, by the land refused to conclude the ceremony and le ft.H em a y have known that Moreno and the towns had been disputing this land for some time and that the Indians had long claimed to have possessed and cultivated it before Moreno bought the hacienda next door. Temporarily thwarted by Rodr\u00edguez's act of conscience, Moreno sought another notary to execute the order and put him in possession. The o fficers from Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara then led their September 1690 petition with the audiencia arguing of the subsequent order until the matter of which land was being referred to could be cleared up and the towns' legal claim settled. The audiencia agreed, rescinding its earlier order in favor of Moreno. To ensure the Indians were not dispossessed without a hearing, the audiencia dispatched a juez receptor ,aj u d g ew i t has p e c i a lc o m - mission answerable directly to the audiencia , who ordered Moreno not to plow the land or bother the Indian residents, on pain of a 500-peso ne. This order an act \"conscience\" in a legal proceeding was not common during this or any period of viceregal history, at least not in the documents I have seen. Indeed, this is the most explicit one I have found in an actual court record. 2Yet \"conscience\" was vital to the workings of law and justice in Spanish America. In any viable legal order, individual human beings must make judgments about how to act in relation to the laws, procedures, This essay Rodr\u00edguez's moment of conscience seriously on its own his 1Agnt127 (1a pte.).2 and (2a pte.).1.

Owensbyrefusal to proceed, and the reason he gave for it, as an occasion to think through the role and implications of conscience in the legal relationship between Spaniards and Indians, and between the king and his indigenous vassals in the New World. My chief aim is to see past the explicit rules, conventions or doctrines that govern ed everyday matters of law and focus on the spirit of judgment that animated relations between Spaniards and I n d i a n si nt h ec o n t e x to fi m p e r i a lr u l e .Iw i l la l s oe x p l o r eh o wt h a ts p i r i tw a s expressed in relation to and came to be challenged by the expanding role of self interest in social life between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries. My point of departure is V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's reaction against the modernist assumption that law can procedures and for works . Rather, Tau reminds us that law's role in a depends as much on the \"spirit\" governing legal interactions as on the mechanics of arrangement. convictions and beliefs. A historical inquiry into the spirit of law demands that we attend to the ways of legality in a particular place, at a particular time, in a particular historical context.3With Tau, thus, I see Derecho Indiano - the Law of the Indies - more as a yielding and adaptive framework than - until end of the Hapsburg period of Spanish imperial rule in the Indies. Tau's seminal contribution to our understanding of Derecho Indiano is his distinction between casuistry andsystem . Employing these two \"categorial concepts\" - not quite ideal types - Tau argues that early Spanish imperial law was essentially casuistic, rooted not in abstract norms or doctrines, but in attention to the individual case and its particularities. He is as concerned with casuistry as a \"social belief\" underlying all legal thought and action as he is with casuistry as a speci c hermeneutical device. Through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries culminating in the nineteenth century, Tau claims, this understanding of sen- emphasizing technical and peculiarities of peculiarities of each unique set of facts. 3Tau(1992) 9, 11. The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 127According to Tau, we have misunderstood early law by assuming the ften represented as a normative accomplishment of the European Enlightenment. This has made it almost impossible to engage Derecho Indiano on its own terms, for the \"spirit, \" \"beliefs\"' and \"convictions\" that Tau argues were at the core of legality in Derecho Indiano are largely bracketed out of discussions on contemporary systems of law.4 looking to Spanish rule attended to the realities of the New World and its peoples. 5Legal decision makers were charged rst with and experiential side of trans- actions and disputes. Their duty was not to the law as such, or to any sense of abstract legal consistency, but to justicia ,a n ds p e c i cally to producing just outcomes in light of all the circumstances. Each case was di fferent and could not be otherwise; no rule could be universal because each case was a law unto itself - a medieval theological idea that can be traced back to Aristotle - perhaps especially amidst the wild diversity of circumstances in the New World. Though legal o fficers had to exercise conscience in all of their matters, or deciding whether and what to notarize - Tau has little to say about conscience as such. Though he refers to \" conciencia \" in passing while discussing \"the world of moral cases\" and probabilism in the introduction to Casuismo y Sistema , and to \"rectitude of conscience\" as one of the requirements for a \"good judge\" in his nal chapter, he does not develop conciencia as a theme.6In this essay, I argue that conscience was a crucial animating force of Spanish imperial law and speci cally of Derecho Indiano . For a time it represented a precept of right and just interpretation in the face of temptations to excess and self-dealing among the king's judges, corregidores ,alcaldes mayores ,receptores and notaries. In political and legal treatises and confession manuals, conciencia connected what was 4 I have made a similar point in O wensby (2008). 5Tau(1992) 19 (quoting Garc\u00eda-Gallo). 6Tau(1992) 58, 60, 488. 128 Brian P . Owensbyknown as the fuero interior - the interior court of the soul's sense of right and wrong - to the fuero exterior of the soul's sense of right and wrong to the fuero exterior of positive law enshrined in royal decrees, ordinances and accepted legal practices and customs. As such, conciencia was part of the matrix of doctrinal and institutional restraints characteristic of jurisdictions, the right of appeal to the viceroy and the king and, crucially for the Indians, the ability to seek a protective writ known as the amparo ,w h i c he ffectively preserved a factual status quo until a full hearing on a matter could be held.7While it is true that individuals o ften the fact that legal practice Tau argues, meant that proper conduct in accord with conscience was universally recog-n i z e da sa no b l i g a t i o no fa l lm i n i s t e r so fj u s t i c e-e v e ni fm a n yo ften laid their duty aside. Conciencia , therefore, as a belief ) - \"a deep and elemental manifestation of facing reality, more vital than intellectual, of which little or nothing is said and which [is] considered to be a basic premise of the society\" - than an idea announced and proven by means of a precise intellectual operation. \"8It h i n ko f conciencia as a self-e ffacing principle, a deep re flex expressing the re flex began to lose meaning as a new spirit of abstraction and distrust for casuistic thinking and its emphasis root the soil of juris-prudence from seventeenth century onward, a process that ran parallel to the emergence of economic concerns at the core of all social and political thought. II As an intellectual, or at least de nitional matter, there was little disagree- ment on the meaning of conscience among early-modern Spanish jurists. In 1611, Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias de ned conciencia as \"knowledge of oneself, 7O n amparos ,s e 233-245; M ar\u00edas (1972) 123. Ultimately, the distinction goes back to O rtega y Gasset (1986). The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 129or certainty or near certainty of that which in our souls is bad or good. \" To be without conscience was to be \"without a soul. \" To act without conscience was to have \"no scruple. \"9The Diccionario de autoridades published between 1724-1739 by the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola retained this de nition and commented that \"[j]ust as nothing gives more life to hope than good con- science, so one of the things that most tears down [ derrumba ]a n ds a p s [desmaya ] the vitality of hope is bad conscience. \" The Diccionario supplied a further gloss, noting that to \"charge one's that a thing be knowledge, rectitude and without trickery, malice or charge the consciences of judges. \"10 This connection between conscience and legal decision making was hardly new in the early eighteenth century. In his 1612 Arte legal para estudiar la jurisprudencia , Francisco Berm\u00fadez de Pedraza argued that law - ius-w a s essentially homologous to conscience, for it was the \"art, that is knowledge\" of the good and the bad within society. This knowledge called upon legal decision makers to deal honestly with their fellows, live by a commitment not to harm others, and above all dedicate themselves to the idea that each entitled to that which was properly theirs ( ac a d au n ol os u y o ). While justicia rested rmly on these three pillars, a \"constant and perpetual will\" was necessary to ground the last of them, for justice was \"a habit conceived in the soul of men. \" And though laws varied by time, land, and nation, said Berm\u00fadez, justice was \"one, constant and perpetual. \" Jurists and judges - and by extension all charged with producing binding legal e ffects - were \"true priests, not of the habit but of the soul, employing equity and justice\" to defend the law - la ley - \"fortress of the universe. \" Who would protect the poor, the orphans, the widows, the prisoners, the pilgrims if there were no law?, asked Berm\u00fadez. Law was \"the soul of the happiness. \"11 In effect, every offi cer of the law and every churchman acting through the king's power under the Patronato bore a responsibility to see that justice was done. The will and obligation to justice lay especially heavy on those charged by training, vocation and duty with the defense of royal law.

By these appointments he \"discharged his conscience\" in service to \"the administra-tion of justice. \" 13Failure to act in light of the royal conscience amounted to a kind of internal subversion of justice and thus of political order. As Jer\u00f3nimo de Ceballos put it in his Arte real para el buen gobierno de los reyes, y pr\u00edncipes de sus vasallos (1613), the \"tribunal of justice\" was the \" rm chain and column on which rests the Empire, with which the good consonance and harmony of political government is assured, the master of political and social life ...\" Aristotle had noted that the destruction of the Republic followed from a failure to maintain \"justice, \" a \"habit of the soul that conserves public utility\" and enables the king and his o ffic e r st o\" r e s i s t...t h ep e o p l eo fp o w e r in the Republic. \" As such, justice was the \"joy of the a fflicted, solace of the poor and unprotected and medicine for the soul\" for it \"humiliated the arrogant\" and \"li fted humble. in its broadest understanding, served as a counterweight to power within the social order. St. Thomas, noted Berm\u00fadez, had made the point long ago: \"The unbridled greed of men would pervert all things if justice did not check their appetites with the bit of its laws. \" 15 According to Friar Luis de Le\u00f3n in his widely-read De los nombres de Cristo (1583), government by men could not match Christ's perfect government. Yet the spirit of the \"living law\" that characterized divine governance could guide human a ffairs, so long as men in positions of political power heeded 12 See Recopilaci\u00f3n de leyes delos reynos de 222. 14 Z evallos (2003) 59r, 62v, 66v. 15 B erm\u00fadez de Pedraza (1612) 12-13, 27.

Those who came to the law o ften told \"lies and falsehoods to obtain their justice by in no other arena than judging was \"friendship\" ( amistad )s op r e s s i n ga n d ckle.17Hardly surprising, then, that so many - particularly New World corregidores andalcaldes mayores - were corrupt and self-serving.18Indeed, the difficulties and temptations faced by all o fficers of the law in the Spanish Empire were widely acknowledged. Not only were the souls the republic itself faced genuine danger. A sense of moral hazard hung over all legal a ffairs in the New World. Between the mid-sixteenth and the mid-seventeenth centuries, Friars Barto-lom\u00e9 de las Casas Jer\u00f3ni- mo Moreno (Dominican) that for of consciences, 19As legal historian Andr\u00e9s Lira has argued, these men, writing from deep moral shock and political disquiet at the treatment of Indians by the Spaniards during the rst century a fter conquest, opened the privacy of the confessional realm by insisting that confessors withhold absolution from by violating or ignoring positive law. 20Put another way, these three writers insisted on a vital connection between conscience and public obliga- tion: to violate the law, or to fail to uphold it was to sin against God and absolution depended on heartfelt contrition and a willingness to right the wrong. This connection expressed a well-established political idea: that the king's great task to rule according to conciencia , implying the convergence of private and public concerns at the very core of political order. This notion pointed to a critical role for confessors. As Robert Bellarmine noted in his On the Duties of a Christian Prince Toward His Confessor (1513),\"[n]ot without r e a s o nd ow ep l a c et h ep r i e s t - c o n f e s s o ro ft h ep r i n c ea m o n gt h o s ep e o p l e 16 L e\u00f3n (1917) 115. 17 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 137, 222. 18 See S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereira (1996) III, 1873-1874 (5.2.17/24/25). 19 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006) 1139-1178. 20 L iraGonz\u00e1lez 132 Brian P .

[T]he prince's eternal salvation depends, to a remarkable degree, on his confessor. \" This was not merely a matter of contrition for private acts: a prince's confession solely to \"sins that relate to him as a private person\" is not a full confession if he \"skips over the sins he has committed as prince. \" This implicated all of the king's officers, and especially administrators are in administering country. \" 21 Two notions followed from this proposition. First, the king needed to attend closely to what his o fficers were doing; he had a duty to ensure that they were behaving properly in the public, political realm, chie flyb yo b e y - ing and enforcing the law justly. Second, all who operated with the color of the king's authority should be held to a standard of conscience that recog- nized their public role vis-\u00e0-vis the law. Lira puts it this way: \"Conscience, beginning with the king's, was the premise and preoccupation of that public order in which Christian government was considered the only legitimate one and had to be on display at all times. \" 22So when Las Casas in his Confesionario of 1545 demanded that confessors refuse absolution unless conquistadores and encomenderos made restitution for the harm they had caused the Indians, he was extending Bellarmine's point regarding the dual private-public role of the prince to all those in the New World who acted in t h ek i n g ' sn a m eo rb yt h ek i n g ' sl i c e n s e .I ne ffect, the fate of their souls depended on satisfying the of conscience wrongs the held ffice. 23The goal, of course, was that they obey and uphold the law, and thereby not succumb to sin; if they had sinned by violating the law, then they were obliged to make 21 From B ellarmino (2006) 223. 22 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006) 1158. 23 L iraGonz\u00e1lez (2006) 1151.

The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 133up for it. In practical e ffect, Las Casas was insisting that conscience have a role in everyday political life in a place where so many people - especially the Indians - were vulnerable to the wiles of the powerful. Alonso de Molina took this notion one step further in his Confesionario mayor en lengua mexicana y castellana (1578), instructing confessants to con- of \"greed. \"25Such an o fficer was obliged to make good those who had been hurt. But Molina did not stop at the most banal sorts of wrongdoings. He held ministers of petitioners from appealing or seeking justice at the audiencia ,o r had not received them \"gently\" with the intent of helping them, but instead \"quarreled with them and dismissed them\" so that they \"would not dare to come before you. \" 26The softsin of turning people away from law was just as erosive of justice as feckless inattention to the demands of ffice corruption of outright avarice. A confessant was always respon-sible for the state of his conscience, public as well as private, and so was obliged to \"rectitude, justice and prudence\" in all his a ffairs. 27In terms, this what Barcelona meant in his ded-ication of Manoel Rodrigues' 1596 Summa de casos de conciencia con adver- tencias muy provechosas para confessores con un orden iudicial a la postre ,w h e r e he insisted that anything that \"bene ts conscience aids the republic. \"28 With the publication in 1637 of Jer\u00f3nimo Moreno's Reglas ciertas y pre- cisamente necesarias para iuezes y ministros de justicia de las Indias y para sus confesores , the process begun in the mid-sixteenth century that gradually bound conscience to positive law for those who held o ffice and exercised through the ority reached its culmination. This is Lira's seminal point. In Moreno as in Las Casas and Molina, the confessional bridged the gap between private life and public. Among those concerned for 24 M olina (1578). 25 M olina (1578) 44r. 26 M olina (1578) 46v. 27 M olina (1578) 10v. 28 R odrigues (1596). 134 Brian P . Owensbythe plight of the Indians, this was a welcome development. Mart\u00edn Acosta y Mezquita, audiencia lawyer and advocate for the poor and prisoners in Mexico City, wrote a foreword to the Reglas ciertas . Bemoaning the sad state of the Indians, he congratulated Moreno for his proposal that those charged with ensuring royal justice be held to account in the court of conscience. It was, said Acosta, a measured response to the fact that royal decrees had been so often ignored by those trusted with enforcing them. As Pope Pius V had once noted: \"Grant me that confessors will do their jobs as they should and I will give you Christian government maintained in peace and tranquility. \" 29 For Moreno, the temptations even of petty power in the New World were so great that \"ministers of justice\" were under a heavy burden of conscience and thus liable to confess even the smallest misstep in their relations with the Indians. This was not simply a matter of rendering judgment in cases at law. It touched every economic, contractual, adjudicative and administrative action ministers of justice might take under color of royal authority, from property agreements, to labor allocations, to tribute to prices paid and charged pursuant to the repartimiento de mercanc\u00edas . In all things, they were obliged strictly to observe the King's laws. So that even if he otherwise acted justly, a minister sinned by entering into any business or contract with his charges for his own bene t, because there was a royal decree forbidding it. 30The obligation ran further Moreno's \"First Rule\" for conf (of thirty) states that anyone who tells a minister of justice that he may legally have personal business dealings with the Indians is himself in mortal by claiming that they had been assured in conscience by their confessors that they could act as they did. 31 For Moreno, mere procedural correctness was never enough to satisfy the spirit of the living law, rooted in natural and divine precepts, to which all ministers of justice owed their conscientious attention. This is what accounts 29 M oreno (1637). See also M ayagoit\u00eda (1996). 30 M oreno (1637) 19.

The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 135for his references to the \" fuero exterior \"a n dt h e\" fuero de la conciencia .\" I n t h e sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, fuero referred broadly to the place where matters of law and justice were properly decided. Las Siete Partidas dened \"fuero something akin to jurisdiction. Etymologically the word derived from the Latin forum and according to Covarrubias it was equivalent to the Castillian plaza , \" b e c a u s et r i a l sa n dh e a r i n g sw e r ec o n - ducted in the most public places of the city and where there was the greatest congregation of people. \"32In the early eighteenth century, the Diccionario de autoridades gave as a rst de nition of \" fuero \" the \"law or particular statute of some kingdom or province\" encompassing \"use and to the locative quality of all law.33Covarrubias did not refer to \" fuero de la conciencia , \" but Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereira did in the Pol\u00edtica indiana in 1648 and linked it to \"mortal sin\" and a duty of restitution (with regard to the obligation to pay tribute). The Diccionario de autoridades did offer an entry for \"fuero de la conciencia, \" giving as a de nition \"the tribunal of reason, which directs and arranges the operations of man, abso-lutely according to divine and human laws. \" 34In essence, by distinguishing between the fuero exterior and the fuero de la conciencia ,M o r e n ow a sm a k i n g the point that public laws in the political world ultimately could not be meaningful instruments of justice un less those charged with keeping them were bound by an inner compulsion to abide by their spirit, not merely by their external formulation. The crucial point, as with the notion of fuero generally, was that one could not be reduced to the other. The two fueros were intimately related, though ultimately each held to what was properly own. The fuero exterior was the realm of positive law and royal decrees interpreted and applied by ministers of justice, where power and rights o ften butted heads. In the fuero de la conciencia the confessor was in charge and confessants of judgment. Thus, because \"in the fuero exterior as i nc absolved without absolving other sins\" and \"everyone should confess. \" For the \"judge of the republic is a judge for the community, and so his judgment must be the community, according to proof ...

III This appeal to conscience can seem quaint, even quixotic at a time when it was commonly said that \"self-interest accomplishes all. \" 36Life, it struck contemporaries seventeenth century, had become lonely, brut- ish, competitive and petty, an arena of \"distrust and suspicion\" in which there were no true friends because everyone was involved in a \"perpetual war, without any sort of truce or peace \" and each person pursued only \"his own business and not the common and good of all. \" This was thought to be especially so in the New World, where Indians were the object of the Span-iards' (and others') manipulative fantasies and abusive the theological moralists who sought some way to ensure that royal o fficers were governed by conscience in their o fficial lives. In a postscript to his Reglas ciertas , Moreno detailed the extent to which \"unfaith- ful ministers of justice\" \"o ffe n d e da n da g g r i e v e dt h em a j e s t yo fG o da n do f the king\" by their treatment of the Indians.

For Moreno the answer was clear: far more than individual souls was at stake in the unconscionable behavior of corregidores ,alcaldes mayores ,tenientes and other ministers of justice on the ground in the Indies. By their conduct, such o fficers not only violated the king's law but sinned against They o ffered worse examples \"even than the Gentiles, \" \"greed\" they threatened to \"undo what the savior accomplished through his death. \" As a result, some \"poor and wretched Indians (those who are Christians) the faith, and th o s ew h oa r en o tC h r i s t i a n sd on o tw a n t to receive it, \" because those who have the \"obligation of justice, to sustain and ennoble it with Christian acts\" instead \"discredit and it pagan works, scandalizing [the Indians] with trickery, the ftand the great greed, \" saying that \"as they are Indians they are not Christians, and it does not matter if they are tricked and robbed. \" 39The individual souls of Worse by ministers of justice threatened the very fabric of New World society. If Indians fell away from the faith or would not receive it because of the mistreatment they su ffered, the kingdom itself was at risk, for as Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereira noted, the king's indigenous vassals were liable to pay to ffset the cost of \"their evangelization and Christian gover- nance. \" 40If the Indians were driven away from the church by the misdeeds of judicial o fficers and others, the rationale for tribute became tenuous, at least in principle. Conciencia in Spain's imperial legal order, thus, should not be understood solely restraining undesired behavior by individual o fficers of the law - o ften it was not. Rather, the concern for conscience expressed deep anxieties, about religious faith, good government, justice and right action in human a ffairs. At a time when human relations seemed increasingly instrumental and competitive, in a place where distant royal authority faced constant challenge by individual 38 M oreno (1637) 54r-59r. 39 M oreno (1637) 55v. 40 S ol\u00f3rzano y Pereira (1996) I 435 (2.19.2). 138 Brian P . Owensbyinterests on the converts to Christianity struggled to shield themselves from the arrows of abuse that rained down on their lives, Moreno insisted that everyone be reminded of their obligations in the fuero interior . Yet this was not a strictly interior matter, as Castilllo y Bobadilla noted in his treatise on corregidores : Cicero had long ago pointed out that nothing was \"more public, more rigorous and more faithful\" than the \"the- ater of Itinerario para p\u00e1rrocos (1662-63), written from Pe\u00f1a's judicial experience in Quito, suggests something of the intricate action that took place on this proscenium that thrust into the exterior drama of the New World. An instruction manual for priests of Indian parishes in New Spain, the Itinerario touches on every issue a pastor might face in ministering to his flock. The tome (running to over 500 pages), spared no ink in discussing the challenges of conversion, idolatry and witchcra ft,o f tribute and its collection, of justice among the Indians and between Indians and Spaniards, of the role natural law played in the lives of Indian subjects, and of the including land owners, miners, alcaldes mayores and their tenientes - and vulnerable Indian parishioners. Conciencia ran like a bright thread through this tapestry of topics, reiterating the idea raised by Las Casas, Molina and Moreno that confessors were to hold all Spaniards to high standards in the fuero interior ,e s p e c i a l l yt h o s e charged with speci c duties by the king's law. Encomenderos had a duty of conscience to treat the Indians well, a principle enshrined in countless royal decrees. 42Judges of residencia w e r eb o u n db yc o n s c i e n c et oh o l dm i n i s t e r so f justice fully accountable, and to demand full restitution for harm done. Those who failed to do so were \"unjust judges, \" said Pe\u00f1a. Having accepted the obligation to \"discharge royal conscience, \" they were \"traitors to their Lord and King, carried away by interest and suborned by money\" and so Such charges against ministers of justice were a logical extension of the fact that the New World's Indians were obligated in the fuero interior of law 41 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 418. 42 P e\u00f1aMontenegro (1662) 242 (lib.

The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 139as well as in the fuero exterior to pay just tribute. Pe\u00f1a was clear. To be \"just\" , tribute had to be measured and proportionate to the ability of the subjects to pay, and always in relation to the bene ts provided by the king, especially the administration of justice.44As a the or to \"abuse and vexations\" by encomenderos ,corregidores ,I n d i a n caci- ques, or parish Having fled, they were not bound in the \" fuero de conciencia \"t op a y tribute they might otherwise have owed, for an abusive encomendero lost the right to demand tribute from his subjects (even if this meant loss to the Crown).45Nor were these Indians, or hacendados or others who might receive them in another jurisdiction, liable to in these circumstances. Moreover, the Indians' decision to pay tribute, like any judgment at law, was casuistic. A long-established doctrine held that those who in the fuero exterior were too poor bore no obligation, in law or in conscience, to pay tribute. The danger in this doctrine was obvious to Pe\u00f1a: if it were too easy for the Indians to claim poverty, \"everyone would want to enter by this door and not pay tribute. \" Yet as natural law favored the poor, allowances had to be made for tributaries, and judges before whom they might appear had to consider \"how poor they are. \" A man who could not feed and clothe his family, was under no compulsion, interior or exterior, to pay tribute. 46 There is a crucial point here. As Pe\u00f1a noted, obligation in the fuero exterior o ft h el a ww a si n t e r t w i n e dw i t ha no b l i g a t i o ni nc o n s c i e n c e ,a sm u c hf o r t r i b u t a r i e sa sa n y o n ee l s eb e a r i n gas p e c i c legal duty to the king. Tribute was a public matter - \"chief nerve of the republic, \" according to Sol\u00f3rzano y Pereira 47- that made claims on the fuero interior of those under a burden to pay it. The burden of tribute was never absolute, for circumstances of abuse and poverty could justify non-payment. Even so, there is no doubt that decisions to suspend payment could be and o ften were instrumental. Yet as I have argued elsewhere, Indians in lawsuits embracing them to assert a kind of moral superiority over 44 P e\u00f1aMontenegro (1662) 151 (lib. II, trat. II, sec.

Individuals or whole villages might before a of conditions - o ften epidemics or flight from a village - made it impossible for them to adhere to previous rates during normal times and to recognized and customary arrangements disrupted by the greed of local tribute collectors or to adjust their obligation to match their circumstances. From Pe\u00f1a's perspective, Spaniards and Indians in the New World shared an obligation to act from conscience in matters of law, each according to his station in a hierarchy that bound all into a single political and moral project. Although it was established law by the seventeenth century that the Indians had the reason and discernment to exercise conscience, some Spaniards continued to contest the most Spaniards and Indians alike appear to have demanded. The Indians' status as men required it. And as Castillo de Bobadilla noted in his well-known Pol\u00edtica para corregidores (1640), addressed to judges, gov- ernors, lawyers and \"other fficials, \" there are \"sparks of original flame\" in all men, which Christians call \"the dictates of conscience. \" At times, conciencia nds its path to virtue without \"raciocination or acts of understanding, \" but for the most part it must be \"regulated by reason, and not by absolute will, and is not free of the censure of a superior, nor can one who has the faculty to do an act, use it when the act is contrary to equity. \" 50 In other words, conscience inheres in all men and compels them to right thinking in judging and discerning right and wrong, but it is neither a guarantee of proper conduct, nor a license for arbitrary acts of will. \"The chief intent and aim which the good Corregidor must have\" - and by exten- sion anyone else under an obligation to the law and justice - \"is reverence for and observance of justice, as much in what he says and does as in that 48 O wensby (2008) 67, 87, 299. 49 P e\u00f1aMontenegro (1662) 250 (lib.

The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 141which he must judge in others, ... because in this object of justice rests the service of God, the discharge of the King's conscience and the good of the Republic. \"51 For Pe\u00f1a and Moreno in the Indies, and Castillo as a more general proposition, conciencia lay at the very core of the political arrangement of society. It was a theological requirement, political principle and moral pre- cept that had to obtain for society to live up to its divine purpose. Those who failed to live by its \"dictates\" - and there were many - violated the very essence of Christ's passion, betrayed the King and threatened the order and stability of society. IV In the Indies, where order depended on a delicate balance between the exploitation and protection of the king's indigenous subjects, conciencia was a critical belief that gave a spark of life to legal treatises, confession manuals and the Recopilaci\u00f3n ,b r i d g i n g religious notions of sin and obligation to the duties of law in the fuero exterior , where power and interest were in play at all times. By the seven- teenth century, all of the king's subjects were fearful and prin- cipled adhesion di fficult choices implied in all a ffairs of law. This is precisely what the representatives of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara understood when they led their petition in 1690. By that time they had been in litigation for at least eight years over the land Moreno claimed. Their situation looked bleak, as Moreno had in hand an audiencia order awarding him the parcel and he was prepared to start plowing. They understood that as soon as he did they were almost surely lost. With crops in the ground and his farmhands living there, the towns would be unlikely to recover the land, given that productive use and occupation constituted prima facie evidence of proper possession. This was why the Indians hustled to the audiencia to stop Moreno from working the land. They invoked their status as \"poor and powerless\" people, \"humble vassals tributaries, who a fter our powerful 51 C astillo de Bobadilla (1750) 270 (lib. II, cap. II). 142 Brian P . OwensbyGod have no other protection. \" They included with their petition a state- ment sworn out in late August 1690 by the local priest, bachiller (university graduate) Father Pedro Camacho de Campos Villavicencio who, in verbo sacerdotis ,i n s i s t e dt h a tM o r e n o ' sc l a i mw a si m p r o p e r .T h el a n da b u t t e dt h e Indians' church, said Camacho, \"where we continually celebrate the holy sacrice of the mass throughout the year\" as had been done \"from time immemorial, \" and it encroached on their cemetery, \"where the faithful are buried. \" This amounted to a \"grave off ense against God our Lord and pre- judice to the native Indians, who for so many years have lived and died as Royal Tributaries of your Majesty and residents of said towns. \" 52On the basis of this petition, the audiencia agreed to override its previous order and freeze the status quo. So it remained for the next decade and a half until a terse 1706 order awarded the towns the land that had been in dispute for over twenty- ve years. The turning point of the case had been Rodr\u00edguez's refusal to \"burden his conscience\" by following an order that did not describe the landscape before him. He could have executed the document in hand and been on solid legal ground. Many other notaries would h a v ed o n es o ;M o r e n of o u n da n o t h e r who did. But Rodr\u00edguez said no and walked away. Of course, there were other plausible reasons for refusing to execute the order. Rodr\u00edguez idly by, given the history of this litigation, and he may have been worried about looking bad before the audiencia if he went ahead. At the very least he might have been summoned to explain his decision to proceed in the face of Indian resistanc e; not a pleasant prospect under any circumstance. A stand on conscience in favor of the Indians was unobjec- tionable at law and he may have anticipated that Moreno would do as he did - seek another notary to carry out the order - rather than complain to the audiencia about Rodr\u00edguez. This other notary may not have known much of the litigation and may have executed the order as a pro forma matter; a fter all, the audiencia had spoken, and more than once. Then again, he may simply have enjoyed greater moral flexibility than Rodr\u00edguez. The explicit appeal to conciencia was not legally necessary for Rodr\u00edguez to walk away. He could have asserted the fact that the description did not 52 AGNT 127 (2a pte.).1, 223r-v, 224r-v. The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 143match the land in question and suspended proceedings tout court .Y e tR o d r \u00ed - guez's concern for conciencia was exactly what Lira says ministers of justice were under a theological and moral compulsion to do from roughly the mid-seventeenth century onward - worry about the fuero interior when act- ing as legal o fficers and understand that knowing error in the fuero exterior exposed them to penance and restitution.53We have no idea how God- fearing a man Rodr\u00edguez was, or whether he confessed on a regular basis. As a royal notary he may well have been concerned, as his profession and duty required him to be, with doing right by the royal conscience. Though he probably had not reviewed the case record, he would have been familiar with the gist of the royal decree attached to a 1688 order favoring the residents of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1rbara. Citing sections of the Recopilaci\u00f3n , that order stated that all o fficers of the king were obligated to \"see to the who su ffer such injustices and vexations ... for of all my vassals they are the ones who, by their tribute, most bene ta n ds t r e n g t h e nm y Royal Crown. \"54Nor was the outcome on that September day just a matter of to were appealing not merely to the letter of the law, but critically to the spirit of judgment and right conduct underlying been sharper, which probably was the point. At least in theory, order and justice in the Empire depended on this contrast. We know that many did not hear the voice of conscience, or ignored it. The confessional was there to remind all who acted on behalf of the law that their decisions were not merely private matters and that there was no hard boundary between the fuero interior and the fuero exterior .S o while many ministers of justice did not confess and many who did doubtless did so formulaically, the principle that conscience burdened all de ned the limits of permitted victims they could claim to have abided by the demands of conscience themselves. In e ffect, conciencia was part of a yielding web of meanings and reliances that stood against unrestrained abuse. Corregidores , 53 We need far more research on how and the extent to which o fficers of the law were subject to penalties prone to transgression, facing as they did the entic- ing vulnerability of indigenous people. Those further from the source of temptation, whose interests o ften ran against the open depredation of the Indians - such as ministers of tribute collection in Mexico City or Lima, royal notaries and judges of special commission - might be more receptive to conscience. For conscience never s poke in a social or political vacuum. It was an ethical baseline in a notoriously con flictual world characterized linking each vassal's immortal soul to the operations of law, the idea of justice, the king's authority and the good of society. If, as Lira argues, the private consciences of public o fficials became a matter of political concern during the seventeenth century, it was in response to a broad sense that the din of private interests - generally referred to by such words as codicia (greed) and inter\u00e9s (interest or self-interest) - was drowning out the law's voice on behalf of justice and good government. This disquiet was hardly new. In Spain and the Indies, the \"universal confronta-tion of all, of some against others, \" as Maravall has argued, was characteristic of the long rupture between the Middle Ages and the emergence of a new, \"modern\" way of being in the world. 55For Tau, this was the same period in which casuistry , as a basis for legality, began to . If older assumptions and understandings held through much of the seventeenth century, in part by insisting on the relevance of conscience, as Lira suggests, it was against the run of historical processes rooted in the growing commercialization of society as a whole from the fteenth century onward. By the middle of the eighteenth century, economic concerns had taken center stage in reformist debates within Spanish realms. The arbitristas of the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth century wrote chie flya b o u t trade and the imperial sc. Reformist minister Jos\u00e9 del Campillo y Cosio in his 1741 Nuevo sistema de gobierno econ\u00f3mico para la Am\u00e9rica focused on economic structures and policies, and sought to recast the role of indigenous people in the Empire as the only viable basis for rescuing the imperial system from collapse. For Campillo, law was to be oriented and just governance 55 M aravall (1975) 341. The Theater of Conscience in the \"Living Law\" of the Indies 145of society - i. e., the \"good order that is observed and kept in Cities and Republics, by enforcing laws ordinances he could of his language, good government , once linked tightly above all. if Campillo's prescriptions were thought extreme in 1741, elements of his economic pro- gram, and signi cant elements of his reasoning and his meanings, became common sense by the late eighteenth century in the context of the Bourbon reforms. 57 Two documents written in 1749 in to displace justice in resolving the tensions of imperial rule. In the Ver- dadera relaci\u00f3n y exclamaci\u00f3n and the Breve y compendiosa satisfacci\u00f3n ,F r i a r Calixto de San Jos\u00e9 T\u00fapac Inca, who claimed descent from the last Inca, addressed himself in the of a Lamentation and Jeremiad to the newly enthroned Ferdinand VI regarding the plight of the \"American \" He faithful subjects, \" had been abandoned by their King and Lord to the tender mercies of greedy Spaniards guided only by self Calixto was not Campillo's turn to \"economic government\" but instead to shore up \"law and justice\" by cashiering Spanish corregidores and allowing the Indians to elect their own judges and conduct their own legal a ffairs, separate from the Spaniards - a jurisdictional solution. Only in this way could the Empire \"put into practice a Christian, Catholic and proper justice, that is to say, law and reason\" that ensure gain gold and silver\" they are le ftwith \"heavy faults of conscience and 56 C ampillo y Cosio (1789) 4; Diccionario de autorida des (1969) III 311-312. There has been some debate about whether Campillo wrote this tract. See N avarro Garc\u00eda (1983); N avarro Garc\u00eda (1995). 57 iryakian 233-257. 58 Clamor de los Indios Americanos 81 (15v). There is some debate about authorship of these two documents, though Friar Calixto was punished for them. See 75-78. 146 Brian P . Owensbysoul. \"59In essence, Campillo looked at a world of self-interest and concluded that the only solution was to give the Indians free rein or even f o r c et h e mt oa c tf r o mt h es a m ei m p u l s e ,F r i a rC a l i x t ot o o kt h ev i e wt h a t justice pursuant to the royal conscience was all that could stand between the Indians and those who would trample them and call it good government. Given the burdens economic processes and legal systems have imposed on vulnerable people in the modern age, perhaps Friar Calixto had a point. In the affairs of men, the voice of conciencia is never silent. But historical processes can produce understandings that drown it out, or make it sound thready and irrelevant in the grander schemes of human activity. This is one way to think about what happened between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, as Europe, both within and in contacts worlds outside itself, underwent the \"great transformation\" that brought economic systems the center of social and political thinking. 60Acute observers - such as Las Casas, Molina, Moreno, Pe\u00f1a, Castillo and Friar Calixto - sensed what was happening without fully compassing it. They worried and o ffered tenuous solutions drawn from their understanding and experience. Actors such as Rodr\u00edguez and the residents of Santa Ana and Santa B\u00e1bara did the best they could in the theater of conscience to speak above the din of codicia and inter\u00e9s . They might have succeed in an individual case, but in the long run the stentorian voice of self-interest and economic imperatives carried the day in the political imagination - at least for a time.

Thus, I shall not address the remainder of his proli co u t p u to fs c i e n t i c writing. I would also like to clarify that, besides the fact that I am not in a position to treat all of his contributions thoroughly here, I shall not attempt to provide the reader with a catalogue of his fruitful intellectual work. I have a di fferent objective: outline the central attracted the attention his colleagues and of many others interested in recreating the Spanish American past both in t h eA m e r i c a sa n di nE u r o p e .A sr e g a r d st h ea u t h o ra n dt h er o l et h a th ep l a y s within this discipline, I believe that the same words that Tau himself dedi- cated ground can be rightfully applied to him as well; i. e., that the historian also has an \"outstanding dra and guidance which have contributed \"decisively to the setting of guidelines within the discipline. \" Similarly, it can be truly asserted that, as for partial disagreements. \" 1 1TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1993) 9. V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and the Legal Historiography of the Indies 151It is appropriate to describe V\u00edctor Tau as a legal historian who under- stands Law as the expression of a way of seeing the world, that is, a legal tradition. This is his natural observatory. Now, it is worth recalling that as a member - possibly, the most prominent - of what can be identi ed as the third generation of great experts in the history of the Law of the Indies - the same generation that reviewed and went beyond the guidelines set by the two highest exponents of the rst generation, Rafael de Altamira and Ricar- do Levene, and the most renowned of the second generation, such as Garc\u00eda-Gallo, Alamiro de Avila Martel and Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa -, V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui ffices a piece of writing such as this. Nonetheless, my desire to elucidate the guidelines of his legal-historical criteria also responds to reason and has a very speci c goal: helping to cover, at least in part, the decit in self-re flection that the legal history of the Law of the Indies has. This discipline, despite its relative theoretical by varied monographs. 2. As for the praise received by the works of V\u00edctor Tau, I understand that their main impact results from his creativity in the proposal of new topics and the treatment of areas that were le ftbehind by ancient masters and colleagues. 2Far from intending to make a thorough record of this kind of contributions, I can underline, from among his original concerns and recon-siderations, the detailed analysis of the set of sources of Law; his preoccupa-tion for the local and concrete practice of normativity; his early and clear awareness of the integration of the Law of the Indies into the intellectual framework of the European legal tradition. In fact, a key aspect of the legal historical thinking of Tau has been his flexible notion of what must be considered Law of the Indies. In this regard, he has a ffirmed that \"against a classical, unitary, rigid image of the Law of the Indies imposed from the Peninsula, there arise new images o f a multiple, unbounded Law of the Indies, stemming from the di fferent regions of the New World, in accord- ance with diverse geographical and human realities of the vast conti-nent. \" 3 2 For an example see T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1980) 331 and 332. 3TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 85. 152 Ezequiel Ab\u00e1soloH o w e v e r ,Im u s tr e g r e tt h a th i s ne style has not always bore fruit expected. I understand that set of his very valuable conceptual creations - like \"oscillations\"4or \"satellite-texts\" ,5to mention just two of them - have not yet become an integral part of the consolidated lexical tools that I believe he can still provide to academia. Besides, I must also admit that I personally do not always agree with opinions. Far from sharing his assertion that \"the bans of good government take the most popular place within the legal system, \" 6I tend to think the opposite. Apart must also be stated that Tau's work stands out, again and again, due to his concern to verify the points of view outlined initially, and because of his honesty at the time of warning on the potential weaknesses of the evidence o ffered. Thus, there have been plenty of oppor- tunities in which he engages in a dialogue with his readership on the di ffi- culties experienced. By way of example, when he presented his works on the customs of the Indies, and a fter warning that \"in studies of the from contemporary Law in its conception and structure, \" he did not fear to admit that the recreation of American customs demanded of him \"an arduous task, not always explicitly expressed, not always along safe paths. \" 7 Besides, while one of his concerns has been to replace the ancient legalist focus of the legal system of the Indies for one based on the notion of legal tradition8(a goal derived from conviction gent use of the most varied sources 9coexists with a formidable rigor and accuracy in the delimitation of the ob jects of study and the exposition of results.10 4TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1977) 88. 5TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (2004) 18. 6TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (2004) 22. 7TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (2001) 14. 8TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 43. 9TauAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 88. 10 Cfr., for example, T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1977) 86.

In my opinion, there are other more relevant aspects. His propositions have fostered and encouraged research more than once, to a certain extent, because they are courteously open to academic debate, they are noted for the formulation of manifold conclusions de ned by a provisional factor 11in- herent in the conviction that no scienti c ever be considered a \"close\" piece.12 I would like to out that several of the distinctive features of Tau's works are along the lines of those of the most salient exponents of the Law of the Indies traditional scholars, especially in the formulation identi ed with t h em e m b e r so ft h es oc a l l e d School of Levene . Among the most important features of this insistent heuristic concern and understanding of legal phenomena requires the integration of past Law into an ample framework of complex socio-cultural expressions; thus, the con-stant concern of the Argentine Professor to legal history and social history. 13It is precisely based on this conception of the nature of legal phe- nomena that Tau ffirms, among other considerations, that \"Law accepted as such by the political authority or by jurists has a scope of in fluence and application that hardly ever reaches all the corners of society. \"14Likewise, as a consequence of such outlooks, \"I like to draw attention to an approach that recognizes laws as social events and which, a fter establishing laws as one of the mechanisms for the creation of the Law, veri es their coherency and tension with the other sources, con rms the presence of social and political forces in their origin and enforcement, notes their unique manners of appli-cation, observes their use unveils social acceptance and resist-ance mechanisms, examines their presence in legal proceedings, notarial records, literature and daily conversation. \" Thus, \"questions arise: what is the role played by jurists within this process and to what extent do laws support the growing strength of state power; do laws re flect social aspirations; 11 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1980) 333. 12 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (2000) 123. 13 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) 4 and 5. 14 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997) 24. 154 Ezequiel Ab\u00e1solodo they propose goals, principles, standards; are all social groups aware of their provisions, or is this awareness limited to legal experts? These are some of the questions that ought to make laws a matter of joint concern by legal historians and by political, social, economic experts, among , each of V\u00edct or Tau's research style is his ne selection of the materials and the clear examinations to which they are subjected. Our author has recognized his \"interest in researching into the notion of justice of a certain author does not have a mere academic purpose, of delight, for sheer academic this aspect, my purpose is to examine the use of this notion in legal practice. And and observe value given to it in the then prevailing mindset. To that end, it is necessary to consider casuist thinking, which is twisted requires notions and rules to support the formulation of particular solutions. The absence of strict tenets within the legal system led to the appreciation of certain notions such as justice, which has played a key role as a guide, end and limit at the same time. \" 16 4. Strictly speaking, and although at present he may be the historian studying the Law of the Indies most concerned in de ning and specifying a sound and original conceptual-th eoretical framework, his scienti cp r o - gram has not always been presented within a neat organic it can be argued that a considerable portion of his thoughts on program and method are more or less scattered through his works.

Such a restrictive conception cannot be applied to our Law of the Indies, nor to other legal systems of the time. \"19 Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui's recognized sharpness bene ts from the fact that many of his thoughts have been enhanced aft er long analysis and the subsequent revision of his lucid initial propositions.

It can said that intuition brings the legal past. Thus, he explains, for instance, and I believe that with some degree of exaggeration in terms of their randomness, that the works that make up La Ley en Am\u00e9rica hispana [Law in Spanish America] did not respond as he is with an acute sense of appreciation of the value of the different historical evidence, Tau bene ts from the smallest traces off ered b yt h ew i d es e to fd o c u m e n t st h a th eh a sg a t h e r e di nh i sm u l t i p l ea n d fruitful incursions into archives. 5.

Far from exhausted, the research I present remains open to new searches and re flections. \" 29 Certainly, the extraordinary academic dissemination enjoyed by works is connected to the most distinguished historiographical tradition of the Law of the Indies. However, there is evidence of an unbiased and critical perspective, which has encouraged the careful employment of of - not linear or - through the contributio ns of successive generations.

The right to memory and lost identities On December 15, 2010, the United States recognized of Canada, Australia and New Zealand thereby reinforcing the hopes of those who considered the Declaration to be an important instrument for the of populations and the reparation of the wounds in flicted on them by history. 1It is common knowledge that the Declaration was approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2007 with the unfavorable vote of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the absten- tion of 11 countries. It was not easy to obtain the approbation of all mem-bers because of the resistance many states to recognize the native popu-lations who lived in their own territories as nations holding collective rights. 2As a matter of fact, already in 1982 a special working group com- representatives of the indig of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities.

I ta s s u m e st h ed e f e n s eo fm e m o r ya sa ni n s t r u m e n tf o rt h ed e nition of indigenous identity and the protection of indigenous rights. The individuali-zation of a new legal subjectivity, the indigenous people, a collective subject whose full self-determination is recognized, is possible only by recognizing their right to manifest, practice, teach their cultural traditions, celebrate their spiritual and religious ceremonies, pass on their history, their culture and their language to future generations. In the text there is no denition of indigenous people. This should not astonish us since it was not contained in the project of 1993. In fact it was not necessary. This new s u b j e c td i dn o tn e e da n yd e nition because it did not ask for state recog- nition or legitimation. It is not necessary given, it is a historical that existed before the states. But it claims, precisely through the use of memory, the preservation and reinforcement of its polit-ical, social and legal system. 5 draftwas adopted by the Human Rights Council but the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Declaration only on September 13, 2007 (Resolution 64/295) with 143 votes in favor, 4 against it (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United States) and 11 abstentions.

Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination Protection community, the people and the indigenous nations are those who \"having a historical continuity those territories or parts of them. They form at present non dominant sectors of society and they are determined to preserve and develop and transmit to the future generations their ancestral territories, and their identity, as the basis for their continued exis- tence as people. \" 162 Luigi NuzzoIn order to exist again as a people it is necessary to be able to remember. But remembering is not memory. It is part of the distinction with which memory works. The other issue is forgetting. As a matter of fact memory is based on a series of selective operations of remembering and forgetting. As Raffaele De Giorgi wrote, the memory is the unity of the distinction between remembering and forgetting. 6 Remembering and forgetting are the distinctions through which memory w o r k sa n da tt h es a m et i m ew ec o u l ds a y ,w i t hac e r t a i ns i m p l i cation, they are the two poles around which both the issue of indigenous peoples' claim for identity and the discourse of colonialism have been structured and from which, in the course of time and in di fferent ways, strategies of assertion or denial memory, remembering and forgetting become the make an legal subject possible or impossible. Only memory of oneself and of one's own history can produce identity and thus subjectivity. On the contrary, those who lack memory or those whose memory was stolen or overwritten do not exist. Franz Fanon reminded this very effectively many years ago opening a meeting on the relationship between national culture and ghts for freedom. According the colonial had produced a \"cultural obliteration. \" In other words it d i s c o n n e c t e dt h es u b j e c t e dp e o p l e sf r o mt h e i rc u l t u r ed e n y i n gt h el o c a l reality, introducing new juridical relationships or of eliminating the \"hated negritude\" led to wrong-footing of the colonial ego , to the irreparable schizophrenia of identity. Many years later in the post-colonial debate the uncertainties about identity became a foundation of power.8The reconstruction of one's past through a long and painful process of re-memorization on the one hand conrmed the impossibility of rejoining one's original identity; on the other hand it was a tool for imagining a new hybridized subjectivity in which the identity of the colonized and of the colonizer melted. Thus it became impos- s i b l et oo v e r c o m et h ec o n flict between the \"colonial self and the colonized other\" and at the same time to establish both the mutual dependence of the 6D eGiorgi (2004) 142-61. 7Fanon (1971) 61. 8 Fanon's central position in post-colonial studies is declared by C hakrabarty (2000) 17. Between America and Europe when strategies conrmed of the world and gave based on concepts of center and periphery. They built a theory of subalternity that, starting from Gramsci's concept of hegemony, overtook the binary logic of rst world / third world, colonizer / colonized and passed from the dialectic self / other to the dissemination of the images of the self and of other. The result was a new subjectivity, precisely a hybridized one, residing in the body of a new protagonist upon which colonial modernity had built its reasoning and that asked to be the maker of its own history. 9 The political battle for the recognition of one's own diversity and one's own right to memory imposed therefore new approaches to historiography. This last one entrusted with the task of revealing the inadequacy of legal and political categories of Western thought in order to favour the comprehen-sion of the world's complexity, and the relationships of power pre-existing its use, thus determining the selection of facts to be told and the way in which they had to be narrated. 10A tt h es a m et i m et h em e t h o d o l o g i c a lr e n e w a l produced by decentralized forces comin g from post-colonial and subaltern and allowed make more canons of Western historiography and the discursive practices of international lawyers. 11 However, there is a still a lot to be done, as the strange case of the derecho indiano seems to con rm. 2. Claiming an Identity: the Road Map of Garc\u00eda Gallo The editors have suitably called this volume New Horizons of Spanish Colonial Law, but what does hide behind the expression \"Spanish Colonial Law\"? What does it hint at, or what is its equivalent in Castilian? The most imme-diate translation, derecho colonial espa\u00f1ol is not of great help. No specialist in Spain or Central and South America would recognize the subject of their 9 (2008) 56-72. 11 C raven (2008); N uzzo (2012). 164 Luigi Nuzzostudies in this translation. We might say that Spanish Colonial Law is the politically correct version of a legal discipline that is well-founded in the Hispanic academic tradition: the derecho indiano . Anyhow, it is not easy to provide a de nition. It seems easier to say what thederecho indiano was not: it was not an indigenous law. Carlos Petit maliciously de ned it as the exotic version of ius commune , and Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero, more polemically, a \"derecho generado o reconocido por parte de Europa para dicha geograf\u00eda y dicha humanidad, como si \u00e9sta careciera de cultura y as\u00ed de capacidad para regirse por s\u00ed misma, as\u00ed como para determi-nar la reglas de recepci\u00f3n y acomodamiento de la gente sobrevenida y extra-\u00f1a de entrada para ella. \" 12In any case it was a European law that on one hand the legal historiography imagined to have arrived in America with the rstconquistadores , on the other hand it was used to tell the story of the West Indies in the same way as the legal history of European countries had been told. Moreover, the expression was the result of an inven- tion. It centuries' de las indias orde los Reynos de Indias .O nt h e contrary it was invented by the Argentinean Riccardo Levene, leading schol- ar of the Argentinean school of legal historians, and founding father of the discipline together with the Spanish in exile Rafael Altamira. 13According to Levene the derecho indiano had to be identi ed with all the law in force in the West Indies. It was an extremely rich prescriptive set of provisions of a different origin and nature that met in a single system able to \"organizar el gobierno espiritual y temporal de las indias, establecer la condici\u00f3n de sus habitantes, regular la navegaci\u00f3n y el comercio y sobre todo convertir a los indig\u00e9nas a la f\u00e9 cat\u00f3lica. \" 14 But the loyalty to the idea of system and the sharing of the aims that thederecho indiano would the doctrine univocal. Simply put, one might say that until the end of the 1970s until Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo's positivistic approach 665; C lavero (2004-2005) 543. 13 On the relationship between Rafael Altamira and Ricardo Levene, see T based on the supremacy of Castilian legislation and on a certain image of the Spanish monarchy in which from the outset the signs of a modern state were there to be seen. Then, with the end of Francoism, the fading of Garc\u00eda Gallo's star and Spain's entrance into Europe it was also possible to rediscover the legal and customary elements of the medieval legal experience. At the same time Spanish legal history started to be included in the history of ius commune and the common European juridical tradition.15 I will begin with Garc\u00eda Gallo.

He had to impose a turning point in Spanish legal historiography through a deep renewal of the conceptual i n s t r u m e n t si tu s e d .A tt h es a m et i m eh eh a dt oh i d et h ec h a n g e si nh i s own point of view inside a discourse and a representation that, both on a political and legal level, focused on continuities more than fractures. 18 15 N uzzo (2008). 16 On Garc\u00eda Gallo's role at the Instituto internacional de Historia del Derecho Indiano founded in Buenos Aires in 1966 with Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa and Alamiro de Avila Martel, see Martir\u00e9 (1996). 17 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1948); G arc\u00eda Gallo (1953b); a critical analysis of the relationship be- tween Garc\u00eda Gallo and Hinojosa in V allejo (1998). 18 These fractures were evident in G arc\u00eda Gallo (1941), where he criticized Hinojosa's thesis on the Germanic component of Spanish law expressed in H inojosa (1910). 166 Luigi NuzzoThe history of law was a legal science that needed its own methodology in order to be told. This on the one hand would free legal scholarship from political constraints, and from the economic and more generally the socio- cultural context. On the other hand it would prevent singling the jurist out as the main partner the legal historian. Moreover, the legal historian was also a jurist such felt the duty to remove his subject, the law, from the influence of other disciplines and in particular freeing it from cultural con- taminations that would alter the issue. Whilst reconstructing the route through which the legal systems and the institutions had developed, Garc\u00eda Gallo did not speak of medieval law, but rather of a present law that regulated the daily aspects of social life. Thus he entrusted the historian with the delicate task of remembering and selecting which were the element for constructing the memory and identity of the jurist and the country and what, once again, was to be condemned to oblivion. The problems the legal historian had to face with dealing with the issue of derecho indiano were not di fferent. Also in this case the re-denition of disciplinary identity continued to be his main aim. Moreover, while in Spain Garc\u00eda Gallo had identi ed Hinojosa as the founder of the discipline, thus contributing to mythicize his pro le and presenting himself as his heir, in Central and South America the absence (from his point of view, obviously) of a school which complied with a strict legal method, took him to propose himself as the true founder of the derecho indiano .19 At the beginning of the 1950s Garc\u00eda Gallo adjusted his strategy. He exalted the role of law as a legal source in the 16th century Indies and subjected the methodologies used by historians disci- of the two scholars, with their openness towards history, See T begi nning as an Americanist historian see the critical analysis of C lavero (2007). 20 The articles are: La ley como fuente del derecho en Indias en el siglo XVI (1951); Panorama actual de los estudios de historia del derecho indiano (1952), and El desarollo de la historiograf\u00eda jur\u00eddica indiana (1953), all published in G arc\u00eda Gallo (1972a). In the following (1967); G arc\u00eda Gallo (1972b). America Europe 167sociology and politics, had inexorably jeopardized the subject of their stud- ies. According to Garc\u00eda Gallo they lacked legal sense, the recognition of the centrality of the legal dimension and the will to study it \"con esp\u00edritu y t \u00e9 c n i c ad ej u r i s t a s . \"21\"La vocaci\u00f3n hist\u00f3rica o sociol\u00f3gica de la mayor parte de los cultivadores estudiosos de la Historia del derecho indiano les lleva a atender a los fen\u00f3menos sociales con olvido de los propiamente jur\u00eddicos y a no valorar estos en su propio alcance sino con criterio extra\u00f1o al derecho. La construcci\u00f3n dogm \u00e1tica, que constituye la tarea principal de los juristas cient\u00ed cos - se ocupen del derecho romano, medieval o del actual - apenas se ha intentado. [...] El estudio dogm \u00e1tico perfectamente compatible con el hist\u00f3rico del derecho indiano, tarea que incumbe a los juristas y no a los historiadores est \u00e1sin hacer [...]. La Historia del Derecho debe ser para el jurista un modo de conocer el Derecho, y no la Historia o la sociolog\u00eda. Por ello ha de estudiarse con orientaci\u00f3n, esp\u00edritu y t\u00e9cnica jur\u00eddica. \" 22 An historian of derecho indiano has therefore to engage in the discovery of his identity as well as the one of his discipline and contribute to build a national conscience by reconstructing the history of its \"national positive law. \" Also, since the law had its identity, it was necessary to read it being aware of its evolution, forgetting the historical and social concern and limit-ing the attention to political, social and economic aspects. 23Consequently the history of the derecho indiano (too long entrusted to historians, at the expense of jurists' attention) also had to be considered as a scienti cd i s c i - p l i n es i n c et h el a w ,b e i n gas u b j e c tm o r et h a nas i m p l et e c h n i q u e ,w a sat r u e 21 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1967) 112.

Lawfulness, being and evaluating knowledge capable of general values into laws concepts, was based on the distance which separated it from the violent world of politics and socio- economic struggles, and its capacity to b and itself a unique, and self-referential system, capable of recognizing its own The derecho indiano was therefore essentially a legislative system.24 In a territorial organism that, just as it happened in 16th century in France, assumed the form of a state where the main theologians, jurists and political thinkers took an active part in process of absolutistic and bureaucratic centralization, the law seemed the most apt instrument for the realization of the sovereign's will. It also enabled the renewal of the sover-eign' s centrality and it was at the same time the clearest instrument of civilization. 25Thus, on the one hand the positivistic tension and the state aspirations introduced a functional legal paradigm to read, from a unitary point of view, any discourse on power and on political subjects as well as those not institutionally active in the Indies. On the other hand the legalistic dimension in which the Conquista was absorbed allowed historiography to intr o d u c eab r e a kb e t w e e nt h ed e s i r e so f the monarchy for the defense of the rights of the natives and its constant insistence on their evangelization and the violent reality for the Indian population.

Claiming an identity: Francesco Calasso and the system of ius commune T h ec o n s t r u c t i o no fan a t i o n a ll e g a li d e n t i t ya n dt h ep r o j e c to fam e t h o d o - logical renewal of the history of law followed by Garc\u00eda Gallo demanded the recovery and the exaltation of the institutional pro l e sa sw e l la st h el e g i s - lative activity carried out by the sovereigns of Castile. Yet in order to achieve these objectives it was necessary to undertake a deep change in the mindset in the way the role performed by Roman law in Spain and its heritage was perceived. Spain, under the dictator Franco, imposed a proudly di fferent (legal) history from the European one. It was a Christian and nationalistic history focused on the primacy of legislation and of state; a history where the juridical literature had a secondary role and where only an echo of the ius commune could be heard. Through the ley de las sietes partidas ,t h eg r e a t drawing up of Alfonso X in 1265, the Romanist and canonistic tradition had also entered the reign of Castile and from there the West Indies. But as a consequence of a precise political strategy aimed at the territorial uni cation, it had become a common law with national character In Spain, as Garc\u00eda Gallo maintained in a conference held in Rome in the middle of the 1950s and published in the Revista de studios politicos ,t h e ius commune for the rst time passed through a crisis highlighting its incapacity to offer appropriate to its inadequacy.27Its principles, he continued, were used to 26 M orales Padr\u00f3n (1979) 308-310; G arc\u00eda Gallo (1977) 755-756. 27 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1955). The Revista de estudios politicos , at which Garc\u00eda Gallo during the 1940s collaborated assiduously, was the organ of the Instituto de Estudios Politicos ,t h e ideological laboratory of the regime, founded in 1939 following the model of the Istituto italiano di cultura . 170 Luigi Nuzzoincorporate the Indies into the Crown of Castile and to de ne the juridical titles which legitimized the dominions. But when the ius commune reached the Indian coasts, through the Requerimiento , its weakness became evident and the scornful answer of two Cen\u00fa caciques was enough to cause the whole system to be debated.28 As Fernand\u00e9z de Oviedo remarked, a fter reading the document, the two Caciques denied the validity of Alexander VI's donation and consequently the Spanish sovereigns and con- rmed their inalienable rights on those territories. Garc\u00eda Gallo imagined them and represented them to us as \" rmes en sus convicciones jur\u00eddicas\" a n dc o n s i d e r e dt h e i ra n s w e r\" c o n s c i e n t e y concluyente: la validez del dere- cho com\u00fan fue rechazada y a \u00e9l opuso el propio derecho ind\u00edgena. \" The consequences of this gesture were enormous. \"Por primera vez se negaba al derecho com\u00fan su vigencia universal y se le rechazaba en la resoluci\u00f3n de los problemas del Nuevo Mundo. \" 29 In the damp forests of Cen\u00fa and for an audience, as the Italian one, with little familiarity with the Indies, Garc\u00eda Gallo put an inglorious end to a universal juridical knowledge, heavy with triumphs in Europe, and at the same time stressed that the insu fficiencies of ius commune h a da l s oc a u s e da bene cial \"Spanish reaction. \" And this time the answers were both adequate and immediate. On a doctrinal level Francisco de Vitoria had substituted the ius commune with the \"system\" of ius gentium and on the old ius commune which had recognized the principles of freedom and independence of the autochthonous populations. I am not sure whether had also been invited to the meeting at the Spanish Institute of Rome that day and, if he had been sitting among the audience, what he might have thought about the sad destiny Garc\u00eda Gallo reserved to ius commune or about his legislative approach to legal history. Garc\u00eda Gallo's 28 The Requerimiento too had a state character. In fact G arc\u00eda Gallo (1955) 157 writes that \"este Requerimiento, pleno de amenazas a quien lo aceptase, tampoco era distinto del que cualquier Gobierno actual, antes de emplezar la fuerza, hace a cualquier grupo de sedicio-sos para que acaten el poder establecido\"; on the discursive strategies of the Requerimiento see N uzzo (2004) 13-85. 29 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1955) 158. Between America and Europe 171discourse (particularly his attention towards national identity system) enabled us to reconstruct the threads that connected Spanish and particularly the infl uence exercised by his system of ius commune .E v e ni ft h eG a r c \u00ed a Gallo's project of methodological newal had presupposed its complete nationaliza- tion, it still needed the idea of a system introduced, by Calasso to endow the medieval juridical experience with a scienti c character and to connect ius commune and iura propria . construction, simply based on the binomial law and was far from the rened doctrine of Calasso. Moreover, both shared the objective of rede n- ing the identity of the discipline and using legal history as an instrument for the construction of a national juridical identity. proposal required the recovery of the historical authenticity of medieval law and the reconstruction of the economic, political and social relation-ships in which the juridical texts and their authors were immersed. It was no longer the time for a \"history of Roman law during Middle Age\" as Savigny had done, for old contrapositions Romanists Italianists) nor for of dogmatic reconstruction. As a matter of fact, the Middle Ages \"a new spirit\" had already taken possession of the old body of Roman law, and put new energies into it and determined a deep transformation unifying that with , its norma del proprio operare\" . 30Roman law was no longer the hard core of the medieva l juridical experience, but rather theius commune and the historian of Italian law was its authorized cantor. It was not only a problem of discipline or an academic struggle aimed at achieving more room for the history of Italian law inside the law faculties. Examining the historicity commune meant considering of an Italian law Italian state and recognizing an Italian juridical identity Romano's institutionalist theory, Calasso identi ed sustained plurality. \"La constatazione della pluralit\u00e0, per\u00f2, come Pietro non era per Calasso la conclu- 30 C alasso (1954) 33; C onte 31 I glesia Ferreir\u00f3s (2000). 172 Luigi Nuzzos i o n ed e l l ' i n d a g i n e ,m al as u ap r e m e s s a ;s e r v i v aap o r r ec o r r e t t a m e n t eu n problema, che per Calasso of fact, according to Calasso, the construction of a national legal history required the reassembling of a plurality of norms inside a unitary system. The ius commune united the histories in one great Italian history seeming to be a system of systems. At the same time Croce's idealism and Romano's theory itself did not allow Calasso to break free from the images of state and law and led him to consider the system of ius commune as a legislative system, or at least to consider the legislative com- ponent as the prevalent one.33The history of ius commune was now the \"storia di questo sistema unitario, e non soltanto del diritto romano comune, e meno ancora interpre- Calasso understood the historicity of medieval law and stressed its speci city with regards the Roman law opposing at rst the dogmatic approaches of Pandectistic school and then the neo-pandettistic revival of the 1950s. Moreover, in order to transform that \"new\" law into a scienti c knowledge and into an instrument to legitimate a discipline in search of redemption inside the European academy, he needed to recover Savigny's notion of system. Calasso could but use the system. Inde- pendently from its legislative and doctrinal connotation it was not identi ed with a logical principle necessary for the exposition and the organization of the subject matters, or with a historic product functional for a precise polit-ical juridical project. On the contrary, it was on one hand a constitutive p r i n c i p l eo fl a wa n di tw a si m p o s s i b l et os e ti ta s i d ew i t h o u tl o s i n gt h e scientic nature and the truth of one's own discourse and of one's own 32 C osta (1999).

The Spanish scholar did not miss the Italian editorial novelty quoting it and recommending as funda-mental lecture. 36He needed those pages for the construction of a unitary and scienti c concept of derecho indiano .T h e yg a v eh i mt h ec o n c e p t u a l framework to keep the old Castilian law and the new law issued for the overseas territories together. As a matte r of fact his theoretical representation did not need a ius commune neither as Roman law nor as law produced by the jurists' interpretation. In the rst case because the Roman law had already been nationalized; in the second case sentation Garc\u00eda Gallo was freed both from historicity and spirituality in which Calasso had instead immerged it any historical and had two pre-scriptive systems remained in opposition: Castilian and the problem of unity. 37This made Calasso's work still useful.

Claiming an Identity: Carl Schmitt and the Discovery of the New World The end of Franco's regime and the overcoming of the nationalistic approach of made rst re-discovery mune possible then enabled onto imaging there the existence of a unitary and organic system. It was based on the dialectical relationship between the general and the specic, as to happen during journey I think it is time to dwell upon the editorial news that was published in Europe at the beginning of the 1950s. While Calasso was re-writing the history of medieval legal thought through the concept of ius commune and Garc\u00eda Gallo was including the Spanish Indies within a legislative, Christian and nationalistic system, the German jurist Carl Schmitt published Der Nomos der Erde im V\u00f6lkerrecht des Jus Publicum Europaeum .39In this book he turned again to international law and, following the same spatial approach to policy that had marked his work in the Twenties, traced the history of the ius publicum europaeum from its beginning to its dissolution.40Schmitt's history not only described Europe's lost identity under It also expressed the desire for new amity l i n e sa n dw i t ht h e mt h ed e s i r ef o ran e w nomos and a new process of space subdivision. The American claims of a new Western hemisphere, the equalization between colonial territories and national territories, the move (following the peace conference in Paris) from a European order to a universal one, t h et u r no fad i s c r i m i n a t o r yc o n c e p to fw a ra n do ft h ep r e - m o d e r ni d e n t i - cation between enemy and criminal, had produced the dissolution of the inter-European state system through which the international relationships had been juridically organized for four hundred years.

Between America and Europe 175states its protagonists and in the discovery of a new world its pre-condition. The voyages of Columbus allowed Europe to know a free and unlimited space that was ready to be textualized and occupied. The Bulls of Alexander VI were the instruments for achieving these aims: they con ned the Amer- ican territories and the Ocean within a legal text and enabled the Landnahme of the Catholic powers, Spain and Portugal. They ensured a konkrete Ordnung with the acts of land taking and land distributing that was a founding principle for organizing the political communities and lands to the Castilian sovereigns in order to spread the word of Christ and exposed the indigenous population to the Cathol ic religion. In this way he attributed a heavy moral obligation to Ferdinando and Isabella and established a legal title that legitimized the Spanish presence in America in front of the natives as well as the other European powers. With another Bull he dened the spatial limits of the Spanish dominion. A line traced one hundred miles west from the Azores and running from the N o r t hP o l et ot h eS o u t hP o l ed i s t i n g u i s h e dt w od i fferent areas.

Europe needed that empty space for its own existence.\"La civilt\u00e0 europea - Carlo Galli wrote - esiste solo perch\u00e9 \u00e8 in grado di impossessarsi del nuovo mondo, di di spartirlo, e di connare l\u00e0 - America (ma anche in A s i aei nA f r i c a )ea n c h ef r al ep o t e n z ee u r o p e et r ad il o r o ,f u o r id a lc o n -tinente europeo. \" 42But the rajas of Alexander VI were not enough for the denition of a new Nomos of the world.

It imposed the overcoming of that unity. According to Schmitt it was possible only when England, \"l'isola che si fece pesce, \" entered the debate thanks to a new \"religione guerriera\": Calvinism.43The amity lines between England and France that appeared for the rst time in a secret clause of the Cateau Cambresis treaty, produced the de nitive disappearance of a world and de ned the structure of European international law. They rati ed the existence of two opposite spaces: one, the European land, realm of law and peace; the other, the Ocean and the still unknown American territories. They were free from law and far from the international treaties, and appeared as real and permanent war theaters in which Western colonial impulses could be vented. Beyond the amity lines the possibilities became endless; there was no more peace and the agreements between European powers had no validity. 44 Four hundred years later the dissolution of the ius publicum europeum and the deep crisis of the political subjects on whom it was based, ordered the search for a new Nomos . The perspective, nonetheless, remained a spatial one. In a conference entitled La unidad del mundo , held in Spain in 1951, Schmitt expressed his desire to bring about a \"tercera fuerza, \" India, Europe, the British Commonwealth, the Hispanic World, the Arabian System or one more force that had not yet been de ned. It could break the \"worrying dualism\" - between East and West, communism and capitalism, enabling the opening of new macro-spatial perspectives and with them making it possible to single out a principle for their balance and the de nition of a new international law. 45It was a new law but with a clear analogy with the 19th and 20th centuries' law of nations. In fact also this one \"se basaba en un equilibrio de potencias, gracias al cual se conservaba su estructura. Tambien el ius publicum europaeum implicaba una unidad del mundo. Era una unidad Europeoc\u00e9ntrica, no era el poder pol\u00edtico centralista de un \u00fanico due\u00f1o de este mundo, sino una formaci\u00f3n pluralista y un equilibrio de varias fuerzas. \" 46Nevertheless, to reform the unity of the world, a new 43 S chmitt (1954) (it. ed. 2002, 85). 44 A synthesis of the historiographical debate in: C assi (2004) 102-114; a critical analysis of the conquest as a production of a new social space in N uzzo (2004) 87 ff.; Ruschi (2004- 2005) 407 ff. 45 chmitt (1950-1951), it. ed. 347. 46 S chmitt (1950-1951), it. ed. 348.

The marriage of his daughter Anima with Alfonso Varela Otero, a legal historian who taught at the University of Santiago de Compostela, strengthened Schmitt's bond with Spain, see Mehring (2009) 509-510. 5 1 T h ec o n f e r e n c ew a sh e l di n1 9 2 9a tt h e Centro de Intercambio Intelectual Germano-Hispano , Madrid and was devoted to Donoso Cortes. 178 Luigi NuzzoThe historiography reconstructed the relationship between Schmitt and Spain and underlined the reception and uses of Schmitt's legal theory in the Iberian Peninsula.52 R e c e n t l yI g n a c i od el aR a s i l l ad e lM o r a l, reconstructing the \"zero years of the Spanish international law, \" showed the e ffect of Schmitt's article, El concepto de imperio en el derecho international , published in the rst volume of the Revista de estudios politicos , on the representation of a new Franchist Order and underlined how an \"endogamous line of continuity\" intellectual Lecambra and Fran-cisco Conde with the international lawyers of the post war years. 53 In these subsequent pages I will not mention the relevance of Schmitt in the cultural debate of Franco's Spain. I will, instead, attempt to highlight evidence of omissions. As a matter of fact he was never cited by Garc\u00eda Gallo or by the historians ofderecho indiano , even though in Spain Schmitt was highly demanded lecturer, his texts were translated in Castilian, on of theius publicum europaeum assumed the Spanish conquest as starting point, Vitoria was one of his protagonists, a legal historian, Otero Varela, was his s o ni nl a wa n d\u00c1 l v a r od ' O r s ,t h em o s t important Spanish professor of Roman law, had friendly relations with him. 54 Why? I will put forward two assumptions and leave the reader to choose the one he or she might like best. The omission could be either the spontaneous fruit of the shabby nation- alism of the legal historians of Franco's Spain that were not really interested in what was happening outside the borders of their country and their dis-cipline, or the consequence of their scienti c consequence strategy that was targeted at the anti-formalist approach of Schmitt or it could be the consequence of his interpretation of Vitoria free from the common universalistic stereotypes. 52 See especially B eyneto (1983); L \u00f3pez Garc\u00eda (1996). 53 R asilla del Moral (2012). I would like to thank Ignacio de la Rasilla del Moral for sending me his article. 54 It is interesting to underline the absence of any references to Schmitt in the work of Garc\u00eda Gallo (1957-1958) 467-476 on Alexander's Bulls that is opened recognition. Between America and Europe 179It could also be due to the refusal to recognize in the conquest or in the violence of the Landnahme the qualifying factor of the Spanish presence in the West Indies or the starting point of the international law's constitutive process. 55 5. Claiming an Identity: V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui and the New Horizons of the derecho indiano During the 1970s the legal historiography started to become aware of the need for a deep methodological renewal under the pressure of the social and economic transformations that were sweeping through Europe. In addition, the more sensitive Spanish jurists took part to this debate. 56In 1977 the Peset brothers and two years later Bartolom\u00e9 Calvero harshly criticized the methodology of Garc\u00eda Gallo and revisited the image that Hinojosa's school had imposed. They came back to highlight the historical dimension of the law, under- lining its relationship with social rea lity and economic locating commune and the constitutional history of 19th century Spain in the nationalistic glori cation of the Hispanic diversity. 57And while Garc\u00eda Gallo still in 1979 held fast to his dogmatic approach and ascribed the little attention given by Spanish ius commune to the importance of the German component of Spanish law in the early Middle Ages, Francisco Tom \u00e1sy Valiente took the last step toward overcoming He closed a revisionist process he started in 1976 in an article with the same 55D e rN o m o sd e rE r d e was translated into Spanish only in 1979, but the guidelines of the book already appear from the conferences and the article translated into Spanish that I have quoted in these pages. 56 S cholz (1980). 57 P eset Jos\u00e9Luis y Mariano (1977); P eset (1978); C lavero (1979). The rst signs of the Spanish methodological renewal are already in C lavero (1974). The same Sevillan Review Historia, Instituciones, Documentos directed by Mart\u00ednez Gij\u00f3n was one of textual space where the new themes and the treatment of methodological problems could be a fforded freedom within the pages of the Anuario that was not possible in Madrid at the time. Almost twenty years later P etit (1993b) 407 de ned it as \"\u00faltimo recurso al alcance de disidentes\" . 58 G arc\u00eda Gallo (1980). But see also G arc\u00eda Gallo (1986) and (1988). 180 Luigi Nuzzotitle as the famous conference Garc\u00eda Gallo held in Rome.59According to Tom\u00e1s y Valiente the article a ffirmed that it was no longer possible to con- ceive legal history as Garc\u00eda Gallo did in 1952, but also that \"la direcci\u00f3n hacia la que Garc\u00eda Gallo hab\u00eda orientado te\u00f3ricamente la Historia del de-recho en Espa\u00f1a, vista sobre todo desde la triple perspectiva del Manual, de sus propios fundamentos y de la caracterizaci\u00f3n global del Anuario, no parec\u00eda convincente. \" 60 When Spain joined the European Community in 1986, Helmut Coing presented at the I Simposio Internacional del Instituto de Derecho Com\u00fan a paper meaningfully entitled Espa\u00f1a y Europa, un pasado jur\u00eddico com\u00fan .H e recognized the end of Spanish diversity and the belongings of the Spanish culture to European history. The director of the most important European institute of legal history, the Max Planck Institute in Frankfurt am Main, enabled Spain to gain access to the shared memory of the old ius commune , and affirmed the role played by the Spanish theologians in the process of the transformation of law as a legal science.61Unquestionably, the history recited by the director of Max Planck was nothing more than \"the oldtranslatio studii with a few super c i a lp a t c h e st oc o v e ri t sn a k e d n e s s ,a few sops to the peddlers of unstable legal currency. \"62That is an umpteenth version of the myth of the history of European law: it was conceived in Italy, developed in France, improved in Holland and at the Pandectistic school in Germany. Coing, nevertheless, introduced for his Spanish public an important variant: he certi ed the existence of the ius in the juridical Spanish inheritance, legitimizing the work carried out by the Iber- ian legal historians, and admitted the champions of the Second Scholastic in the European legal history. Three years later, in 1989, in a conference organized by the Centro di studi per la storia del pensiero giuridico moderno , Spanish was ready to go on and submitted itself to a kind of 'group Italian colleagues. 63In the introductory paper Tom\u00e1 syV a l i e n t e 59 T om\u00e1syValiente (1976a); see also T om\u00e1syValiente (1976b). 60 T 3640. 61 C oing 62 O sler (1997). 63 C lavero /Grossi /Tom\u00e1syValiente (1990) 633-654, see the review by lez(1990). Between America and Europe 181denitively denyed the representation of the escuela de Hinojosa offered by him. Tom \u00e1s y Valiente disclosed the ideological manipulation of Garc\u00eda Gallo and challenge the very existence of a school of Hinojosa and later of Garc\u00eda Gallo.64This was not the only thing. The organizers were conscious that a conference on Hispania had to investigate the legal projection of its image on the overseas dominions. Thus they entrusted V\u00edctor Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui with the task of explaining the exoticism of the derecho indiano and its relationships with the ius commune and the Castilian law. And Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui (not for- getting rst further- more claimed that it was impossible to understand and describe the ius commune in Spain \"sin tener debidamente en cuenta ese singular fen\u00f3meno de expansi\u00f3n jur\u00eddica en el espacio Atl \u00e1ntico. \"65 Subsequently the derecho indiano and its protagonists as well as Castilian law and its jurists were knocking at the door of European legal history. There were \"un \u00fanico sistema jur\u00eddico de ra\u00edz europea continental\" , and \" u n a\u00fa n i c au n i d a dd ee s t u d i o \"i n t ow h i c h ius commune , Castilian law and derecho indiano merged. Garc\u00eda Gallo and his innumerable works kept o ffer- ing Tau the methodological coordinat es and the irreplaceable portrait of a centripetal system. The object of those methodological coordinates and of that system, however, appeared to be much more complex in the paper presented by Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui than it seemed if one read the texts of Garc\u00eda Gallo or those legal historians that in the same years also saw in the West Indies the European systemic ius ofius commune for reading the Crown's engagement in favor of the natives and for V\u00edctor Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui kept on declaring his debt to Garc\u00eda Gallo, but at the same time proudly remembered his a ffiliation to the school of and, following the historiographic tradition inaugurated by Levene and Altamira (that Garc\u00eda Gallo had always criticized because of their lack of legal disposition), sought to restore the complexity of the derecho indiano (2003). 66 The great attention devoted by the Argentinean school towards history testied by M artir\u00e9 (1969); on Argentinean legal history see A b\u00e1solo (2008). 182 Luigi NuzzoWithin a common history the derecho indiano was a di fferent type of knowl- edge and its identity could not easily be bridled by the idea of legislative or jurisprudential system. Besides, the system of Garc\u00eda Gallo was not an his- torical reality, but a projection professor and under- l i n e dh i st i m i da p p r o a c ht ot h en e wm e t hodological proposals during the 1980s, but he did not fail to keep distance from him. Some years later, for example, in a methodological work on the prospects of the derecho indiano , he not only recognized that \"persiste en la historiograf\u00eda, en dosis muy altas, la fuerza modeladora de la cultura legalista, \" but also invited the legal histor-ians to reconstruct the (broken?) relationships between law and the social net and to substitute \"a cultura legalista con una cultura jur\u00eddica. \" juridical culture could have truly enabled the \"situar la ley dentro del orde-namiento en su verdadero lugar, seg\u00fan la materia y las \u00e9pocas, y habr\u00eda hecho posible una 'lectura inteligente' - que no es ingenua ni maliciosa - de los textos legales, interrog \u00e1n d o l o sal al u zd eu n ac o n c e p c i \u00f3 na m p l i ad e lf e n \u00f3 - meno jur\u00eddico. \" 69The awareness of this complexity made it possible doctrine, and juris-prudence. 70It Anzo \u00e1tegui himself attempted to satisfy with two important books published in 1992. The rst, La ley en Hispanoam\u00e9rica ,w a si nf a c td e v o t e dt ot h ed i fferent sources of the derecho , and the second, titled Casuismo y siste- ma, was a esp\u00edritu .71 Moreover, Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui was searching for the identity of the derecho indiano , but the discovery or the re-discovery of the legal pluralisms to which its research was leaning, was no longer a problem that had to be overcome, nor was it the starting point of an investigation necessarily addressed at focusing a superior unity. The not disappeared and hanged dan-gerously with its German rigor over the unordered world of the Spanish Indies. Similarly, the idealistic tension that sustained his project could have reproduced the dream of a spiritual and legal unity, making it again possible 67 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992b) T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997b) 41. 69 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1997b) 43. 70 See T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1986) and (1989). 71 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992c) and (1992a). Between America and Europe 183to tell the old story of a conquest without conquest nor conquered popula- tions in representation of the system had an element that counter balanced it. Beyond and against the system there was another category of interpretation, the casuismo .I tw a s too an \"anachronistic\" concept, as Tau Anz \u00e1tegui himself underlined. It was a word that once again had nothing to do with facts but that rather dealt with interpretations, helping us to enter into a \"cultura com\u00fan refrac-taria a la idea de sistema. \" 72Thederecho indiano was an ordenamiento casuista , a pluralistic order that re flected the pluralism of the political world of Spanish Indies and was able to bravely resist attempts texts to their contexts and brought back the law into the social world, enabling the critics of a idealistic la jurisprudencia o la activi- dad judicial. \" 73\"El derecho indiano - Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui wrote in the epilogue - aparece como un ordenamiento abierto a distintos modos de creaci\u00f3n - normas legales, costumbres, jurisprudencia de los autores, pr \u00e1ctica judicial, ejemplares, equidad, etc. - con ciertos principios rectores y leyes generales, pero con vastos espaci\u00f3s para disposiciones particulares, privilegios, excep- ciones y dispensas. La materia, las personas, el tiempo y las circustancias eran atendidas preferentemente en la soluci\u00f3n de los casos dentro una sociedad que luc\u00eda sus estamentos o estados. \" 74 At the ve hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America (within a solid historiographic tradition and for the readers ffered a deeply innovatory lecture the American world that, I 72 P etit (1993a) 676. \"A riesgo de sorprender al mesurado V\u00edctor Tau con formulaciones radicales - Carlos Petit wrote, 669 - situar\u00e9 Casuismo y sistema en el terreno as\u00ed acotado de una histor\u00edogra a de creaci\u00f3n que, siendo jur\u00eddica, encuentra adem \u00e1s implicaciones en la experienc\u00eda de derecho presente y a\u00fan puede proyectarse hacia el futuro. \" This brings Petit to conclude (671): \"la formaci\u00f3n que acre dita V\u00edctor Tau es s\u00f3lidamente tradicional, mas ya lo ser\u00eda menor su mismo pensamiento; Casuismo y sistema , a despecho de la nutrita bibliograf\u00eda que lo acompa\u00f1a, ser\u00eda entonces un libro radicalmente (post)moderno. \" 73 P etit (1993a) 668. 74 T auAnzo\u00e1tegui (1992a) 570. 184 to think, could have caused doubts and perplexities in Garc\u00eda Gallo and in his numerous scholars. InCasuismo y sistema V\u00edctor Tau Anzo \u00e1tegui face the problem of the natives. However, the construction of the legal indigenous order as a casuistic order that was open to the diversities and to the neces-sities of praxis, allowed a more conscious re flection on the role of the indige- nous populations in the Hispanic American society and at the same time encouraged refl ection on the did not anticipate postmodern feelings nor did it arrange them in an ordered and constitutional plan for rights and different subjects that were destined to be sacri ced on the altar of legal formalism of modernity. On the contrary, through di fferent means swinging between protection and repression - the application of some old legal status to indigenous, their introduction into Spanish procedural law, the imposi-tion of the Castilian language, forced urbanization and obviously their con-version to the Catholic faith - it had the aim of one day overcoming the diversity of indigenous populations Astrea.

Introduction On 19 March 2007, a Chilean citizen led an appeal challenging as uncon- stitutional a Court Regulation issued by the Court of Appeals in and for the city of Santiago in October 1995.The details of the proceedings are irrelevant here; what is noteworthy is that the judgment that put an end to the pro- ceedings has been considered a true historic landmark . Indeed, not only was it ther s tt i m et h a ta na c t i o na g a i n s tt h ei n t e r f e r e n c ew i t hf u n d a m e n t a lr i g h t s was admitted before the Constitutional Court, but it was also the rst time that the Chilean High Court had declared partly unconstitutional a Court Regulation by this development sparked great interest among specialists and lay people, I am aware that it is unrelated to the topic of this publication; furthermore, readers legal historiography might a topic of debate about American or European con-stitutional case law have? What relation is there, if any, between the labor of constitutional courts and the history of Spanish colonial law on which this book is focused? Or, lastly, has V\u00edctor Tau ever addressed the study of the concentrated control of constitutionality? F i r s t l y ,i nr e p l yt ot h el a s tq u e s t i o n ,Im u s ta d m i tt h a tIa mn o tf a m i l i a r with any work by the Argentine legal historian on the creation of the control of constitutional courts,3ornally * DER2014-56291-C3-1-P . like to thank Javier Barrientos and Alejandro Ag\u00fcero for their comments and information, which helped me the fore- going.4In fact, I could only attest to the opposite.5However, I believe that the judgment rendered by the Chilean High Court is not only of great interest to those who study the ways in which law is created, 6but also intended for the study of legal historians who have avoided contaminating the interpretation of the legal past with legalism and / or statism, in work-s h o p ss u c ha st h o s ec o n d u c t e db yV \u00ed c t o rT a u . 7 The foregoing is not the only reason that can be provided to justify the use of the Chilean judgment as a starting point for this paper. I also believe that its analysis may lead to the formulation of proposals aimed at the renewal of legal historiography as regards the study of colonial law. It is well-known that opening up new themat ic and methodological horizons has been a constant concern for V\u00edctor Tau; 8yet, I will quote one of an interview almost twenty years ago: \"I that one of the major topics deserving the attention of scholars is what can be called the Law of the Indies at the transitional stage towards the formation of national law systems. \"9 Tau himself has developed some aspects of his proposal,10but his works will not be analyzed in the following pages; instead, the aim is simply to try to draw attention to some problematic aspects of the study of transi- tional law. The rst aspect is evident: is it appropriate to include the Chilean case within the Law of Transition? It should be borne in mind that answer-i n gt h i sq u e s t i o ni nt h ea ffirmative suggests that not even at the time when \"national law systems were formed, \" 11w a sa ne n dp u tt ow h a th i s t o r i a n s have called the vestiges or remnants of the Law of the Indies in national laws .12 It is not necessary to be a specialized linguist to realize that the preceding terms somehow convey the idea of a residual. Therefore, this work is chie fly aimed at questioning the use of such terms in the au(2007-2008). 11 T au(1977a). 12 G uzm\u00e1n(2010). 194 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enahistory, which forces me to start from the very beginning, that is, by trying to prove that the Chilean case must be included in the list of well-known vestiges or remnants. II. Colonial Remnants in the 21st Century? From Formal Constitution to Material Constitution in the Republic of Chile For a legal historian, the following paragraph of the scope of economic powers since, on the one hand, the reference is too vague: 'manner of operation of the courts.' The manner of proceeding in disciplinary matters is, for (...) ning powers. The narrow regulatory scope intended by t h ea p p l i c a n tf o r Court Regulations is not in line with the tradition of the important matters which have been thus regulated since Colonial times, by the Real Audiencia rst, and by the Supreme Court later. Therefore, it is necessary to de ne the scope of this power at the constitutional level. \"13(Emphasis added.) The Chilean High Court has given constit utional hierarchy to the continuity between the Reales Audiencias of the Indies and the republican courts, in the understanding that the latter must be seen as an institutional reformulation of institutions. Nonetheless, may concern legal historians can be inferred, since even if the Court acknowledges that the boundaries the regula-tory are rather the that is no Having I that the Chilean legal historians themselves from the endemic loneliness inherent in their work,14ensuring them a place in this topical debate. 13 A ldunate (2007) 229. 14 C aroni (2005).

As is widely known, the histor-ical roots of domestic power can be back to ancient times. 15None- itself within the culture of ius commune ,w h i c hd o m i n a t e dW e s t e r nl e g a l thinking at least until the revolutionary crises.16 To simplify, be stated that for such a culture, domestic power was not subject to the law, but rather a direct and largely arbitrary power of the father of a family, which based on love, did not exclude most obscure sector of the government of men on both sides of the Atlantic. Thus, for instance, in her study on the \"populated house\" in San Miguel de Tucum \u00e1n, Romina Zamora the operability that such corpus of texts on oeconomics - so interesting for the great Austrian historian18- had in the Hispanic world in the late 18th century. The conclusions drawn by Zamora's study and other similar pieces of research show that there was no reduction in the scope of the ancient domestic power 19th century.19Accord- ingly, it cannot be exclusively identi ed with the power granted to Spanish and American judiciaries,20given that the survival of domestic power within the sphere theoretically pertaining to individual rights was very common throughout the 1800s.21In short, there is nothing natural, if I may say so, in attributing such power to courts. 15 B runner (1977). 16 V allejo (1998). 17 H espanha (1997). 18 Z amora (2010). 19 T \u00edoVallejo (2001). 20 S olla (2011). 21 A g\u00fcero (2010); T \u00edoVallejo (2010). 196 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaAnother point to consider is the fact that a wide sector of the Chilean academia insists on underlining the regulatory nature of form quality of the contents said Court Regulations may govern. This has considerable e ffects on the control of constitutionality of such provisions. In any case, what must be emphasized is that a sector of academia has contended that such regulations are rooted on immemorial practice .22W h i l ei ti st r u et h a tf o rs o m ep e o p l es u c hp r a c t i c ei n c o r p o r a t e s traditional elements into the Chilean source system impregnating it with irrationality, 23it is also true that, beyond this kind of criticism, the mere use of the phrase immemorial could wonder: What connection can be estab- lished between the word \"immemorial\" and the ancient constitution ?E v e n though this term has had a prominent place in many legal systems, history offers some representative examples of its usage in the constitutional terrain. As Pocock rightly demonstrated many years ago, it was certainly English constitutionalism that used it more e ffectively for the purposes of placing common law o u t s i d et h es c o p eo fp o l i t i c a lp o w e r ( s ) .24Later on, American revolutionaries by an expert: \"The British who opposed the American version of the constitution were 'looking ahead,' away from the ancient constitution, to government by consent, to a con- stitution parliamentary command, in which government was entrusted with arbitrary power and civil rights were grants from the sovereign. The Americans were 'looking backward,' not to government by consent but to government by the rule of law, to a sovereign that did not grant rights but was limited by rights. \" 25 It is true that not many parallelisms can be drawn between the current Chilean constitutional issues and the political con flicts that Monarchy with its 17th century. However, it be recalled that one thing is to protect immemorial possession and 22 A ldunate (2009a). 23 A ldunate (2009b). 24 P ocock R eid(2005) 52. More than just Vestiges 197quite another is to transfer that idea to the realm of constitutional powers. It is in this sense that we might point out that insofar as Chilean legal practice does not go back beyond the creation of the Real Audiencia ,26the power granted to its successor institutions does not stem from the dark and indenite mists of time, but rather from the political will of some very determined men. The term \"immemorial\" is not used in an attempt to protect the rights of individuals; it is on ly an institutional practice directly linked to a way of understanding the law and its management which comes from a world where the Audiencias of the Indies identi ed with the source of all jurisdiction, id est ,w i t ht h eK i n g .27 Nonetheless, this widely known story about the political uses of the ancient Constitution, coincident with the immemorial practices that were so deeply rooted in the Hispanic world, does not concern the most classical Chilean constitutional scholars at all. Not only do they accept the existence of Court Regulations naturally, they also contend that they make up a body of general and abstract rules generally issued by collegiate courts aimed at imposing for the most and effi - cient operation of the judiciary. 28In short, the new Audiencias into which the republican courts turned have further reinforced their self-government p o w e r ,e x t e n d i n gi tb e y o n dt h a to ft h e Audiencias of the Indies, since the current system of distribution of competencies is based on regulation and on the predominance of a formal Constitution. There is little doubt that keeping ancient legal terminology \"Court Regulations\" currently has high standing in Chile, the same does not occur in other states that once shared Chile's political gap opened in 1808 did not a ffect the survival of the legal tradition in the Spanish American territories.30This can be proved with a single piece of information: the Dictionaries published throughout the 1700s in the Peninsula de ned the term \"Court Regulation\" 26 B arrientos S ilva 156. 29 30 A g\u00fcero 198 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enain the old sense.31Nevertheless, the latest edition of the Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola [Spanish Language Dictionary] published by the Real Aca- demia Espa\u00f1ola [Royal Spanish \"In ancient Law, a decision taken as a general point by a supreme court or council with the attendance of all of its divisions. \"32 Such ancient law was kept alive in the colonial Spain of the 19th century, but not in the present one, governed by the Constitution of 1978.33Conversely, Chile has undergone a rare metamorphosis that has enabled it to become part of the regulatory typology determined by the Constitution in force. As some Chilean authors have been claiming, there are still many legal mech- anisms created at the core of the Law of the Indies that still survive there, besides Court Regulations. This is the case, by way of example, of the ancient 'consultation' process, consisting of the by an upper court of those resolutions deemed too importa nt to be decided just by a lower court, even without a party's request. Although this consultation process was com-monplace in times of the Spanish Monarchy, not that understanding their most important Court Regulations, consultations, visits ... have survived in some places, but disappeared in others. Their mere existence or inexistence indicates a 31 The term Court Regulation was not included in the well-known Diccionario Autori- dades , Regulation: A ltamira (1987) 26-28 \u00bbAutos\u00ab. 32 http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=auto. 33 Autos acordados de la Real Audiencia de la Isla de Cuba, Habana 1840; Autos acordados de la Audiencia Chancilleria Real Establecida en Santo Domingo y trasladada a Puerto Principe, suprimida por Real Decreto de 21 de Octubre, cumplimentado en 12 de diciem- bre de 1853, a la letra, en extracto \u00f3solamente mencionados, seg\u00fan su importancia y vigor, recopilados y anotados por Don Jos\u00e9 Medina Rodr\u00edguez, Puerto Pr\u00edncipe 1854; Colecci \u00f3n de Autos acordados de la Real Audienc ia Chanciller\u00eda de Filipinas y de las soberanas y superiores disposiciones que re\u00fanen a la vez el car \u00e1cter de gobernadores de provincia, I-V , Manila 1861-1866. 34 B arrientos (1990). 35 C arocca (1998) 197. More than just value of history as a constitutive element of the law in force, which, undoubtedly, concerns both historians and jurists. I am aware that these assertions are not innovative. Many decades have passed since Paolo Grossi called for c ollaboration between historians and jurists,37but I rmly believe that there are not many opportunities for this as offered by the analysis of the Chilean case. Indeed, the complex combi- nation of tradition and will, or, if preferred, between Court Regulations and constitutional normativity, has stimulated a very interesting debate on the adequacy or inadequacy of history to a constitutional order based on the recognition of fundamental rights. 38While part of the academia insists that the Political Constitution of the Repub lic of Chile does not include a single article expressly empowering the Supreme Court to issue Court Regulations, another maintains that such power is most important manifestation of the traditional economic superintendence entrusted to said Court, which is currently found in Article 82 (amend ed text of the previous Article 79 of the Constitution). 39This latter sector of academia repeatedly resorts to his- toricist order to justify important reg-ulatory power to the the framework of the well- known superintendence granted to the Court and understood as a legacy of the ancient Real Audiencia ,w h i c h ,i na d d i t i o n ,i sa l s os a i dt ob es h a r e db y other Supreme Courts.41 We should recall that it was but the Constitu- tional Court itself that decided that both the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to issue Court Regulations. 42By way of simpli- cation, it could be argued the Court has empowered courts to con- tinue acting as they did before and a fter Chilean independence. In the words of another author: 36 E. g.: Autos, acuerdos y decretos de gobierno del Real y Supremo Consejo de las Indias, Madrid 1658. 37 G rossi (1972) 2. 38 S ilva (2009); P feffer (2010); (2010) 802. 40 A ldunate (2009b). 41 Z \u00fa\u00f1iga (1998). 42 Sentencia Rol N\u00ba 783 (2007): \"Si el art\u00edculo 93 n\u00ba 2 de la Carta fundamental otorga a esta Magistratura competencia para revisar la constitucionalidad de estas normas, es evidente q u ev a l i d ae s t ac o m p e t e n c i a \" . 200 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1ena\"What turns out to be inconsistent in the precedents of the Constitutional Court analyzed herein is that the abstract control of constitutionality nally protects the regulatory powers of the high courts of justice, anchored in the independence of this branch of Government, and especially of the Supreme Court, a policy of absolute deference to the Judiciary; although this is hard to reconcile with the Rule of Law, which requires observance of the principle of legality and of the distribution of regulatory power that places legislation at the top of the hierarchy of the sources of Law; this priority is protected by the principle of democracy. \"43 For an observer outside the Chilean constitutional debate, the regulatory power granted to the courts con flicts with the concepts of national sover- eignty, formal legislation and separation of powers, which are supposed to be fundamental for modern constitutionalism. 44This imaginary further taken in addition, that from the dissolution of the Real Audiencia of Santiago de Chile in 1817 to the present time, Court Regulations issued by Chilean courts have addressed very protection constitutional rights or guarantees] and the action for for miscarriage of justice. Moreover, several Court Regulations issued by the ancient Real Audiencia of Santiago maintained full force and eff ect in the Republic of Chile until the early 20th century.45So, notwithstanding the task of jurists is the analysis of whether Court Regulations are constitutional or not, the to doubts regarding their compliance with the basic principles of what we have come to understand as the Rule of Law. 46 This is the point where legal experts should pay attention to legal histor- ians, who face a task full of challenges, especially that of trying to recreate the complex history of Court Regulati ons in order to understand what they were and what they currently are. In order to undertake this task reasonably, the role played by Court Regulations m ust be contextualized during the different stages of legal tradition, where casuistry and system coexisted for many years. 43 Z \u00fa\u00f1iga (2011) 415. 44 G rimm (2006). 45 B arrientos (2014) T\u00edtulo preliminar. 46 C osta (2002).

The Real Audiencia of Santiago, its Court Regulations and, ultimately, the power of custom in the present-day Republic of Chile The history of the Real Audiencia of Santiago, meticulously narrated by Javier Barrientos,47is not very clear on the intersection between the economic and / or domestic functions of the Real Audiencia relative to superintendence and the issuance of Court Regulations; furthermore, what Barrientos has described is precisely the opposite. Up to its dissolution in 1817, the Real Audiencia of Santiago felt no limitation whatsoever to issue all of matters.48Later on, the Court of Appeals, which replaced the Real Audiencia in the rst constitutional interregnum, did exactly the same.49I refer readers to Javier Barrientos' thorough analysis on this matter, and I will only point out that to determine the regulatory scope mentioned by the Constitutional Court, which attrib-utes it to the traditional operation of the Real Audiencia , a careful reading of all the is required. Nonetheless, challenges remain ahead; say, the Court Regulations issued by Councils and Reales Audiencias responded to these casuistic beliefs that d o m i n a t e dt h el e g a la r e n au n t i lt h el a t e1 8 t hc e n t u r y . The following question can be posed based on How we expect to systemic abstractions today on historic material that completely ignored them at the time?50Once again, projecting current legal in an attempt to the well-known superintendence attributed to the Supreme Court distorts the history of that government of justice that differed so much from what we now know as statism.51Indeed, it was this kind of government which managed the Indies,52although it did so by 47 B arrientos (2000a). 48 B arrientos (2000b). 49 B arrientos (unpublished). 50 V entura Bele\u00f1a (1789).

In this same vein, it is worth mention- a subtle warning by V\u00edctor Tau: \"This prevailing criterion of the so-called legal legal deci- sions also covered government a ffairs. A writing regarding the management of such aff airs, stated that in the Consejo de Indias [Council of the Indies], 'it is unusual to nd a or business which, though denominated governmental, does not contain a great deal of civil, canonical or municipal precedents, laws of the Kingdom, laws of the Indies, Ordinances, resolutions, Bulls and special charters of 53 M artir\u00e9 (2005). 54 H espanha (1986). 55 G arriga (2004b). 56 G\u00f3 ngora (1981). 57 B G\u00f3 ngora Escobedo (1990). 59 G\u00f3 ngora (1951) 301. 60 A g\u00fcero (2007). 61 G arriga (2006b). 62 M alag \u00f3n(2005).

Certainly, this sector of academia may share solutions with although power granted the Chilean courts - which, based tradition, allows them to issue Court Regulations - requires a very special background that, when trying to con-textualize the di fferent historical values of the term Constitution, 64will get rid of the categories that had no place in the pre-revolutionary universe.65 Those trying to nurture this particular legal historiography, called critical by others, could clarify the colonial tradition by reading the collections of Court Regulations one may notice that the Audiencias in the Indies issued a series of provisions, generically termed court regulations, internal matters operation of the judiciary, but there was also a considerable amount of orders regarding matters generically classi ed with- in the concept of 'good government, ' and there are no records that the Crown limited this regulatory activity. \" 67Secondly, that such power pre- vailed during the in Chile under the diff erent Constitutions that enshrined the principle of separation of powers, to the point that the matter was not only addressed in the debates that eventually resulted in the enactment of the Court Organization and Powers Act of 1875, but it was also done incidentally by of the Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure of 1902 and 1906, respectively. A further step was taken in 1971 with the enactment of a law ordering that a subsection be 63 T au(1992a) 509. 64 H espanha (2000) 5-18. 65 T au(1997). 66 H espanha (1984); H espanha (2005) 33-35. 67 B arrientos (unpublished) 37. 204 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaincluded into Section 96 of the Organic Code of Chilean Courts, which stated that \"all court regulations of a general application and nature issued by the Supreme Court shall be published in the O fficial Gazette. \"68And, lastly, that even when the Chilean Constitutional Court has exercised control over Court Regulations, it in turn given constitutional value to a regulatory power. attempt to integrate this special example of colonial survival, if it can be de ned as such, within the Chilean legal order; as continue to great imagination. 69However, it could be said that such power either pur- ports to have a certain originary nature or, as I believe V\u00edctor Tau would say, it forces us to acknowledge the strength of the power of custom in Chile in the 21st century.70At this point, the spirit of Andr\u00e9s Bello holding his famous Code appears before historians, who, rather surprised, can only wonder: What happened the assertion according to \"following the modern Codes, custom has been deprived of the force of law\"? 71 To sum up, since the existence of Court Regulations has gained if some aspects of the ancient constitution remain,73t h eo n l yp o s s i b l ec o n c l u s i o ni s the following: the long-standing struggle between formal Constitution and material Constitution still continues in the Republic of Chile in the 21st century. 74 3.

Both are key issues for comprehending the origin and nature of the persistence of a material understanding of Constitution in the ancient territories of the Monarchy once the revolutionary / independence movements covered the American space with written Constitutions. Without the history of this persistence, I rmly believe that it is not possible to understand the current controversy on the control of constitutionality of Court Regulations in the Republic of Chile. III. The Starting Point: from Fundamental Laws to Hispanic Constitutions.75 It is widely known that we owe Ricardo Levene the rst delimitation of the Law of the Indies' history, regardless of the fact that his proposals accepted peacefully. 76Even though I will not attempt to study the history of legal historiography here, I will, in fact, deal with one of its more relevant subject matters: the laws of the Indies. V\u00edctor Tau has warned us against read- i n gt h e mw i t hal e g a l i s tv i e w ;77he has recently o ffered a careful description of the condition of the legal order of the Indies before the crisis of 1808: \"That order was not con ned to the laws issued by the Court. It had to be extracted from the varied present reality and from the roots of the past. For such purpose, it was necessary to resort to brie ngs, to critical and historical writings, to the most signi cant legal instruments, to a varied and changing legislation of both royal and 75 This title belongs to a collective work that has been awarded the Bicentenario de las Cortes de C\u00e1diz Prize promoted by Congress of Deputies: L au(2006) 357-417. 77 T au(2007). 206 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enalocal laws that, to a great extent, remained outside the scope of the Recopilaci\u00f3n [Compilation], and to the experience described by viceroys in their memoirs, etc. This is the foundation of the Collection, to which he (Benito de la Mata Linares) added the results of his work, his professional experience, throughout his years in the magistracy. \"78 One of the most relevant features of this legal order was uncertainty, which was part of its own physiology then. However, throughout the nal decades of the 18th century, it began to be perceived as a true pathology.79In the w o r d so fo n eo fi t sm o s t erce critics: \"Royal laws that expressly abolish civil law maxims are commented and twisted so as to reconcile them with the ius commune t ow h i c ht h e ys h o u l dc o n f o r m ,a si ft h e yd i d not include any new decision. G \u00f3mez and the others, on the basis of the axiom that the abolishment of laws is terrible and must be avoided even against the voices and provisions of law, in order to reconcile them, under the assumption that Roman laws are the genuine ones, will use any ction or extravagant meaning to render our laws futile. be noted that criticism had scarce incidence in the practice, which was marked by unmanageable and unstoppable partitioning.81 D e s p i t es o m ed a t aw h i c hc o u l dp r o v eo t h e r w i s e- Nueva Planta Decrees, the decline of Councils and the surge of Secretarios del Despacho (Dispatch Secretaries), the creation of the Intendencias of the Indies, etc. - we must not be misled by appearances. Far from adopting a rationale the the of corporations in the last the 1700s, which entailed the multiplication of short, uncertainty reached unprecedented levels, so that many for a legal reform, which, expressed in political terms, could well be translated into a constitutional reform. After the crisis of 1808, however, some dared to suggest that the ancient American constitution was rooted in the laws of the Indies.83It was Fray Servando Teresa de Mier who wrote this proposal that has attracted the attention of historians, 84some of whom are convinced this clergyman 78 T au(2011) 163. 79 M art\u00ednez Marina (1965). 80 M ora y Jaraba (1748) 218. 81 S cholz (1981). 82 M art\u00ednez (2007) 11-96. 83 M G\u00f3 ngora than just Vestiges 207was the last criollo .85But beyond the political weight of Fray Servando's proposal, what remains true is that it was not shared by the most prominent political personalities of his time, which suggests that the traditional criollo discourse had fallen into decline.86I have used some thoughts of Teresa de Mier with the intention of presenting a well-known issue from an American standpoint, an issue could be formulated as follows: Did the Catholic Monarchy have a Constitution? And, if so, which one was it? 87 1. The Monarchy and its constitution(s) To the present day, historians agree that the question about the constitution w a sn o tt h ec a u s eb u tt h ec o n s e q u e n c eo ft h ec r i s i so ft h eM o n a r c h y .88This approach has further reinforced the long-dated thesis put forth by Halper\u00edn Donghi, which states that the events at the time rather than the willingness of Spanish Americans led to independence in Spanish America. 89Indeed, it could be summarized that not only independencies, but also Hispanic con-stitutionalism itself, may be considered the o ffspring of the fall of the Catholic Monarchy. I must clarify that by Hispanic constitutionalism I mean the array of texts that appeared in all the territories of the old Mon-archy since 1811. In short, I believe that despite the endeavors of the advo-cates of history understood as the history of progress - if there are any le ftat this stage - the truth is that rather than French invasion, it was shameful and granted the then subjects of the Monarchy to wonder whether it had a Constitution.91 The mere existence of this question inspired others of greater complexity. With the exception of afrancesados (Francophiles), by 1808 everyone recog- nized Ferdinand VII as Monarch irrespective that some a thorny, long-standing question: How many constitu-tions were there in the Hispanic territories? The history of the Monarchy 85 A nnino (2008). B rading (2003); (2006a). 87 (1998). 88 P ortillo (2008). 89 D onghi (1985). A similar approach in R odriguez O.

This is exactly what the Marquis of Bajamar expressed in 1785 before the members of the Consejo de Indias he chaired: \"We live (...) in a Christian They live in our House: the Sovereign is its owner, and as such sets forth disciplinar y and external governance rules in all matters leading of Bayonne vacatio regis. The volatilization of the physical body of the Monarch was lethal to the ancient corporeal metaphor that had magic,94so that although the Catholic Monarchy had been a Christian Republic, other corporations understood they could claim a similar condition. The miniaturization of the Republic / Monarchy and its embodiment in other republican entities, understood as societies, could not shock anyone given that this notion was one of the chief pillars of the o fficial political culture at the time. As the extremely conservative law expert Dou y Bassols, sign the Constitution in 1800: \"What cannot be left unnoticed is that it is not detrimental for the absolutely monarchical constitution of a State to contain democratic and aristocratic entities, regarding the powers of the members of such entities, as long as the head of the nation is entrusted to the superiority and sovereignty of the King above all. \"95 It was in this cultural context that the beloved subjects of the Catholic King were faced with the famous question on whether there was a Constitution or not. Just as it had happened a couple of years before in the French kingdom, this type of questioning signaled that a profound shi ftin the legal-political paradigm break with many centuries of history. 96If the existence of a 92 B ajamar (1785). 93 P rimo de Verdad y Ramos (1808). 94 L emp\u00e9r \u00e8re(2004); R ojas (2007). 95 D o uyd e Bassols (1974). 96 F uret /Hal\u00e9vi (1996). More than just 209historical constitution was not accepted, then e fforts should be made to dra ft one or more new constitutions, which threatened to create a new constitu- tional cycle. As widely known, both in the U.S. and in France, the Consti- tution was no longer considered the resu lt of history: \"A constitution is not t h ea c to fg o v e r n m e n t ,b u to fap e o p l ec o n s t i t u t i n gag o v e r n m e n t ,a n da government without a constitution is power without right, \" said Thomas Paine ( The Rights of Man ( 1 7 9 1 - 9 2 )i nh i sf a m o u sd e b a t ew i t hE d m u n d Burke ( Reflections on the Revolution in France , 1790). Something similar took place in the Hispanic world. At rst, various Peninsular and American public law experts tried to make identied that had been quashed by centuries of legal plurality may imagine that the examples of the Kingdom of Navarra or the Basque provinces must have played an important role in the constitutional of the constitutional diversity that emerged a fter was well-known foral speeches.99Valencian, Cata- lan, Majorcan, Aragonese people ... advantage of what historians have called the \"orphanhood of the Hispanic kingdoms\" to lost liberties,100 as rightly stressed by the ultraconservative Borrull in a paper published in 1810, that is, almost one hundred years a fter the Kingdom of Valencia had suffered the enforcement of its Nueva Planta Decree, which cian law.101 The historical constitutional framework that began to be shaped in 1808 was not exclusively peninsular; in fact, the Spanish perspective prevented contextualizing the interpretation of a key time for the entire Hispanic world. The study of the famous Consulta al Pa\u00eds [Country Consultation] stands out among hundreds of examples that could used as grounds for this assertion. The leading scholars who analyzed this particular initiative 97 P eir\u00f3 (1985). 98 P ortillo (1991); G arcia P\u00e9rez (2008). 99 B usaall (2005). 100 H ocquellet (2011). 101 B orrull y Vilanova (1810). 210 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enalimited its scope to the Peninsula, and failed to consider the American responses to the Consulta al Pa\u00eds .102At the same time, this stance was shared by American historiography, which did not endeavor to study the Spanish American aspect of the Consulta al Pa\u00eds e i t h e r .I ns u m m a r y ,f o rd e c a d e s historiography either concealed or ignored a series of transcendental writ-ings as responses to the Consulta al Pa\u00eds .103Nonetheless, recent research has shown that the referred Spanish American responses were incorporated into the Instructions to the representatives appointed to the Junta Central [Cen- tral Board],104where the impulse resulting from the organization therst elections held on Spanish American soil was consolidated.105In many historians have already incorporated a bi-hemispheric perception of the famous Consulta al Pa\u00eds into their research.106 In any case, the history of the crisis of the Monarchy and its consequences still requires research not hard liberal historiography may strive to prove otherwise,109most of the rst representatives of the di fferent Hispanic territories - both in the Junta Cen- traland in the Cortes Generales y Extraordinarias - shared a material percep- tion of what a Constitution was or should be. Thus, the ancient Constitution could be broken down into as many constitutions as territories were repre-sented, and actually all provincial constitutions included both privileges accumulated over the years and new claims, mostly Spanish American, now understood as rights. 110In fact, there was a novelty, given that these rights were based not only on their ancient privileges and / or customs, but on the geographical and human elements - topography, climate, fauna, 102 A rtola (1959); S u\u00e1rez(1982). 103 Among these instructions there is the Memorial de Agravios [Memorial of Grievances] drafted by Camilo Torres. On this matter, readers may refer to the superb documentary collection published by A lmarza /Garnica (2007). 104 R ojas (2005). 105 D emelas -Bohy/Guerra (1993). 106 R ojas (2008); A lmarza (2010). 107 G oldman (2007). 108 C lavero (2000b). 109 P iqueras (2010). 110 It is worth recalling that from early times, several petitions for the acknowledgment of the rights of the trans-Atlantic provinces reached the G arrido Vestiges 211flora, condition of the inhabitants, etc. - had been revealed by the scientic explorations made during the last decades of the 1700s.111 there are wide territories to be discovered by means of research showing what elements of the ancient constitution survived beyond the new political horizon that opened up a fter 1808. Although we know that the Hispanic universe set aside the traditional discourse when the written con-stitutions were dra fted, this fact does not shed any light as to how much of the historic constitution remained in force in the framework created by a new (?) constitutionalism in the ancient territories the Political historiography, constitutional historiography I tw o u l db ep r e s u m p t u o u so fm et oa s s e r tt h a th i s t o r i o g r a p h yh a sn o td e l v e d into this complex research eld.113Moreover, as I have mentioned above, the celebration of the di fferent Bicentennials has not only made available to experts a myriad of sources of potentially unmanageable proportions, but it has also contributed to center much of the debate on independence on constitutional matters.114Thus, legal historians might become the main players of a debate that does not only a ffect the knowledge of our past, but also the understanding of our present. However, I believe diagnosis is not an great changes in recent decades, this has not been the case of legal historiography. At present, polit-ical history holds the predominant place that economic history held for years. Led by recognized authors such as Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Guerra, 115this two di fferent stances, namely: It directly with it, insofar without resorting to arguments stemming from legal history, be it traditional or modern. 117Even 111 P imentel (1998). 112 B ellingeri (1993). 113 C hiaramonte (2010). 114 G uti\u00e9rrez (2010); C alder \u00f3n(2010). 115 G uerra (1992). 116 A nnino (2010). 117 R odriguez O. (2005). 212 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enathough the basic sources for the study of the period are of a constitutional nature and, accordingly, chie fly legal, the value of a legal historian's knowl- edge in the historiographical eld is far from guaranteed. The present state of affairs suggests that a wide gap, caused by a special type of deafness, is dividing historians. In my opinion, the main consequence of this situation is that the interpretation of similar (minutes Councils regulations, documents become endlessly multiplied and increasingly contra- dictory. 118 In this state of a ffairs, I believe it can be stated that if a new horizon for colonial law history exists, it will need to face a three-fold challenge. In the rst place, legal historiography must set aside any nationalist conceit. We might 1808 in unitary terms, which means peninsular or American. Nor can we a ffirm that the rst manifestations of political entities existed at that time. Accordingly, the origin of national laws ( derecho patrio ) cannot be rooted in any of these constitutions, irrespective the fact that the institu-tions which started dra fting these new texts and establishing new political and institutional practices were not those of the peaceful (?) times of the Catholic Monarchy. In the second place, legal historiography must attempt explain how tation, and so on must within their context and not in isolation, ultimately deprived of legal background. If not, our com-prehension of the past will be irreparably distorted by virtue of the projec-tion foregoing the localization of continuities / discontinuities in the language of the law. Lastly, legal historiography must undertake the di fficult task of dening the foundations of legal modernity. Within this task, however, the existing di fficulties do not stem that much from misunderstandings arising in discussions with other historians but from its own core. The plain truth is that many legal historians have accepted, somewhat methodological options who usually pretend to make a genealogy of their own knowledge. Admittedly, this state of a ffairs 118 enough so as to main- tain that Spanish and American legal historiography have completely rid themselves of the burden of the past, let alone to certify that a new legal history of constitutional modernity has managed to introduce new historio-graphical conventions beyond the very limited scope of the discipline. 119 This brief outline of the history of historiography is aimed at giving c o n t e x tt oah i s t o r i o g r a p h i c a la r g u m e n tt h a tb r o k eo u ta g a i n s tt h eb a c k d r o p of the celebration of the Bicentennials. Focused on the con flict between the ancient and the new constitutions, the existence of two con- tradictory versions of the history of the Monarchy crisis. While the rst v e r s i o nd e s c r i b e st h ec o n s e q u e n c e so ft h ec r i s i sa sar u p t u r e ,t h es e c o n d version attempts to stress that the continuity of understandings reduced considerably the modern components of new political ideas. This serves to answer not only the usual question of how revolutionary the Hispanic revolutions really were, 120but also another ques- tion that statism were those determined to noted \"generality, \" \"territoriality, \" \"hierarchy, \" etc. In sum, it refers us to all the elements that make up the photographic negative of a society structured in corporative terms and a political power expressed in jurisdictional terms. 121 3. By way of conclusion: an interpretative proposal At this point, I will outline the key elements of my proposal, but before I do so, I must admit that they have changed throughout the years. At rst, I was lured by the most radical discourses, id est , those that understood Hispanic constitutional power or powers as a departure from the ancient discourse of the corporative Monarchy. constitutions did not imply a transformation as radical as usually contended. 119 L orente (2004). 120 D iMeglio (2008). 121 L emp\u00e9ri \u00e8re(2003). 214 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaIn my opinion, the rst Hispanic constitutions shared a common ele- ment: all of that segments of legal order of the Monarchy were given constitutional hierarchy in their Peninsular and Spanish American versions.122I do not mean that there was nothing new under the sun; quite the contrary, Hispanic constitution-alism could not better itself in some aspects considered essential for the establishment of a new constitutional order in other regions. Thus, for in- stance, the new legal devices, purportedly born from the inclusion of the principle of separation of powers in all constitutional writings, did not undergo major practical reforms on either side of the Atlantic. 123Something similar it stressed multiplication of the Hispanic institutional fab- ric.126 In a nutshell, if it is assumed that the rst Hispanic constitutionalism voluntarily incorporated a series of elements from the ancient state of a ffairs, or remnants easily new legal orders that gradually developed both in the Peninsula and in the Americas a fter the fall of the Catholic Monarchy. There is little doubt that the number of such elements was large, although it is worth focusing on one of them in particular because it is closely related with colonial law vestiges, namely: the establishment within the Hispanic sphere of a new notion of law and, consequently, of Code. IV . From Casuistry to System V\u00edctor Tau has oft en stated that one of the most fruitful elds for the history of the Law of the Indies is the one that emerged a fter American independ- ence. Because the interpretations on derecho de transici\u00f3n (Law of Transition) 122 G arriga /Lorente (2007); L orente (2010). art\u00ednez (1999). T ernavasio (2002); P aniagua (2003). 125 M u\u00f1oz de Bustillo (1998). 126 A nnino (1995). More than just Vestiges 215are so numerous, it is impossible ffer a list of relevant works here.127 Nonetheless, I believe the approach that both Peninsular and Spanish Amer- ican legal historiography share in general is not wholly convincing when placing into perspective the complex background of this Law of Transition. Even at the risk of o ffering unfair criticism, I will outline what I have come consider insu fficiencies. The rst one is clearly evident: For decades, the history of 19th-century law has too o ften been identi ed with history comments on new collections, etc. have made up the basic material of the history of Codi cation, which has also been governed by the binomial legal modernization = Codes. Scholars have agreed that both Peninsular and Spanish American legal scenarios were dominated by slow Codi cation for despite legal issues remained very similar on both sides of the Atlantic. So why do I assert turn, can only be appreciated when contrasting it with the example o ffered by Napoleonic France. However, if we listen to some contemporaries, the problem did not reside in the inability to dra fttexts but in transforming a political and juridical culture. By of our hereina fter just because we say so? If nothing is missing in our constitution, how come they have been so neglected? (...) What purpose does it serve for the people that the nation established in its general Congresses that the Kings would abide by them, and that they would undertake this as a sacred obli- gation (...)? Have we unfortunately not precisely the oppo- site?\"128 Fl\u00f3rez Estrada's fears were well-grounded. It was not by chance that the forefathers of the early Hispanic constitutionalism manner of determining and managing the legal order beyond the crisis of the Catholic Monarchy. Thus, the early Hispanic con- stitutionalism did not only favor the reproduction of a crepuscular ius com- mune , but also supported it so that its domination of the di fferent Spanish 127 Some of them are excellent: G onz\u00e1lez(1988). 128 F l\u00f3rezEstrada (1810) 5. 216 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaAmerican and Peninsular scenarios continued throughout much of the 1800s. It was at the core of this constitutionalism that the rst hurdle appeared for the establishment of general legislation on both the history of codi cation is assumed to be part of the history of constitutionalism, which, even if it may appear evident at rst, has not had a relevant place in Spanish historiography. In my country, it has been possible to study the history of codi ed texts without aligning it to constitutional history, so that the chronology of the legal history of the 1800s and 1900s has been almost exclusively marked by different landmarks. This kind of our most recent past has practically disappeared at the heart of modern legal histor-iography, but it still causes severe damage in the work of many jurists inter-ested in fashioning the history of their own disciplinary I suggest political of value, the true law was embodied in the Codes, which, at the same time, abrogated the ancient casuistic culture that had prevailed in the Christian Western world for centuries. I must stress that if these conceptions are maintained, legal historiography is likely to remain in the same place it was, that is, preserving the history of the Constitution as an exclusive eld of research for constitutionalists, political scientists and his- torians of ideas. It is worth mentioning that I have nothing against their work; my criticism is only aimed at the traditional absence of legal histor-iography in the area denoted by the history of new Constitutions. Thus, I believe that there is a rst link between Codes and Constitutions that cannot be ignored; it simply requir es a close reading of Constitutions. This proposal can be explained as follows: Besides main state-ments contained in Constitutions, it is necessary to do the same with their small print. Here is an example to illustrate this idea: Several historians have commented on the famous declaration of the Cadiz Constitution, and have More than just Vestiges 217identied it with the clearest precedent policy for the uni cation of law: \"The Civil, Criminal and Commercial Codes shall be the same for the entire Monarchy, without prejudice to variations that the Courts may duce under speci c circumstances\" (Section 258). The truth is that the inten- tion of the Cortes Generales y Extraordinarias (Constituent Assembly) to unify the law is undeniable; nonetheless, historians tend to forget to relate to the rst paragraph of the Section with the second one, although it contains a provision pointing out that the delegates to the Constitutional Conventions of Cadiz were aware of the diversity of territories and peoples. 129What the Cadiz Constitution de ned as \"speci c circumstances\" looks familiar to those who study the history of colonial law, which for centuries tried to adjust to very di fferent circumstances by using a series of speci cm e c h a - nisms, among which the recognized obey but do not comply stands out. Anyway, since the vehemence of the Code did not resist any peculiarities, it was necessary to design instruments to enforce it.130Without them, the idea of a Code, rather than the Code itself, resulted already in 131Being autonomous, such instruments were deter- mined by a familiar maintenance of the regulatory legacy of the Catholic Monarchy on both sides of the Atlantic. As was the case with the Cadiz Constitution, almost all Hispanic constitutions included two rather contradictory ideas. On the one hand, they committed to renew the regulatory order and, on the other, they deemed that the ancient order should remain in force commitments were e ffective. His- panic constitutionalism, which at the outset had been legitimized here and there with the purported recovery of monarchic laws, nally understood that all of them - king, local corporations, various jurisdictions, etc. - continued to coexist under the new constitutional order as long as they did not con flict with it. It shall su ffice to recall that the insurgent Constitution of Apatzing \u00e1n had to acknowledge that \"(...) as the Sovereignty of the Nation adopts the set of laws that shall replace the ancient laws, these shall remain in full force and e ffect, except those repealed herein and in other decrees\" 129 C lavero (2000a). aroni (1996). 131 C lavero (1978a); C lavero (1978b): Clavero (1982). 218 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1ena(Section 211). In other terms, the rst Hispanic constitutionalism was one of the causes - if not the rst - for the maintenance of the casuistic rationale that for centuries had managed the legal order of the Catholic Monarchy. 2. The force of casuistry and the di fficulties of the system On both sides of the Atlantic, formalizing the constitutions of the regulatory legacy of the brought a eff ects, among which the accumulation of regulations stands out. Thus, it can well be affirmed that the system continued to be threatened by casuistry for decades. It may seem that the accumulation of regulations is a mere technicality just for the use of legal experts; however, repeals directly a ffected a new way of political power, which determined the design of instruments needed to exercise it. Once all Hispanic constitutions had adopted ancient legacy, they must have undoubtedly pondered this question: in the face of so many texts, from di fferent times and contradicting one other, who decided what law was and how was this done? The combination of two antithetical notions on how to identify legisla- a known issues that dominated the legal scenario world throughout the 1800s. Firstly, the long-standing idea that law was not exclusively passed by the assembly, but also determination typology\" arranged according to absolutely interchangeable, the rules adopted by Parliament could not prevail over those issued by the other branches of government, , experts laymen. In this respect, we should not be surprised by the great di fficulties faced by those committed to implementing mechanisms for the defense of law, such as the establishment of the duty of judges to provide grounds for their judgments, or the estab-lishment of appeals to Courts of Cassation. However, both measures had 132 L orente (2011). More than just Vestiges 219been adopted in France in 1790, that is, a year before the National Assembly approved the rst French Constitution.133 The rst Hispanic constitutionalism created collection also and judicial branches, since it forced the reformulation of a set of ancient practices. This had dire consequences inso- far as it hindered the uni cation of the law. Many years a fter the independ- ence movements, Andr\u00e9s Bello described \"For this reform to be truly useful, it must be radical. In no other part of the social order we inherited from Spain is the axe so necessary. As regards political reforms, we are not inclined to dismantling everything; but our trial system merits its total removal and substitution for another. Maybe, it would not be an exaggeration to affirm that this system all experience Law. What sometimes makes wary of their presence is the concern that exists against some of them, even within the respectable class of magistrates and legal experts. For instance, almost no one recognizes the advantages of having judges and courts ground their decisions, a practice in line with the principle of general responsibility that it is the soul of a republic, or, rather, of any government. In a country where the executive branch cannot make a decision, unless pursuant to a law and by invoking it, on the smallest investment of public monies, can a court have the power to adjudicate disputed property that may be worth hundreds of thousands of pesos without stating pursuant to what law or principle the adjudication has been made, or without explaining why one of the titles invoked must prevail over the other? This seems outrageous. \" 134 The new law, allegedly consisting only of the of forensic \"concordances\" among texts and brie flyp u t :B \u00e1rtolo may not have been mentioned any longer in the peninsular forum, 135but t h ea d v i c eo fG \u00f3mez y Negro - whose Elementos de pr\u00e1ctica forense [Elements of Forensic Practice] originally published in The afore- 133 L orente (1989). 134 El Araucano N\u00b0 197, Santiago, 20 de junio de 1834. 135 T ormo (2001). 136 G\u00f3 mez y Negro (1838). 220 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enamentioned work advocated what should be deemed law: el la litiga- ci\u00f3n (forensic practice) must be based on the search for the rule within the history of national law. Continuity prevailed in an editorial market almost entirely dominated by the presence of works written 1808, which were criticized, success of this particular technique is the well-known Librer\u00eda de escriba- nos [Library of Notaries] by Joseph Febrero, published in 1769, which was re- used, or rather (re-)ordered, commented, some important who for decades replicated the same technique on the other side of the Atlantic. 140Laura Beck has stressed that the \"curse\" against this type of literature uttered by Savigny and developed by the Historical School, also necessary for the process of structuring the canon of history of legal liter-ature, has created a dramatic gap between historiography and its own sour-ces; in fact, this does not allow us to assess the constituent value such literature had for legal thinking in the Hispanic world of the 19th cen- tury. 141As Beck has asserted, \"while kings and ft, governments stated that the 19th-century legal-political class nurtu red a cult for totally hypocritical legal- ity on both sides of the Atlantic. In the 19th-century newly formed states, both the Code and its culture were ignored,143which was meant to reformulate and assimilate conception 144The well- known concordancias (concordances) between Roman Law and the new Spanish, Mexican or Chilean Laws to continue determining the mindset of jurists and informing the practice of judges and courts.

C o n c l u s i o n s What is the value of history? There are few professional historians who have not asked themselves this question during their As the shelves of well-stocked libraries, so readers need not fear that I expand on this matter. However, I would like to recall some thoughts of Tom \u00e1s y play a signi cant role: to contribute their legal experience of the past for the understanding and improvement of our present world. \" 145Tom \u00e1syV a l i e n t e ,a sm a n y others, was concerned with the relation between historical times,146but he simpli ed the matter by a ffirming that if history has a purpose, such purpose is to understand the present (\"anyone who does not make this use of history will write dead books\").147 To this day, I am not quite certain whether some of the objectives of legal history in general, or of colonial law history in particular, are similar to those in the works of Francisco Tom \u00e1s y Valiente. My intention has been to follow his advice in this contribution as a tribute to V\u00edctor Tau, in an attempt to relate current issues with the historiographical treatment of what can be considered their origins. In my opinion, the former comes not only from a tradition that started at the time of the Conquest, which served to extend the imprint of European legal culture in the Americas, but from the inclusion of many old notions in the new (?) legal systems following the independencies. Nonetheless, the treatment of this issue may eventually end as the content of d e a db o o k si fi ti sn o tr e l a t e dt oaf u r t h e rq u e s t i o nIc o n s i d e re s s e n t i a l :W h y did the Hispanic world o ffer so much resistance to the state-building process that dominated the Western world throughout the 19th century? I am aware that before answering this question, its own hypothetical nature may be challenged. Yet, I believe that the Chilean debate over the legitimation of the existence and scope of Court Regulations issued by courts can only be 145 T om\u00e1syValiente (1997b) 4773. 146 K oselleck (1993). 147 T om\u00e1syValiente (1997c) 5062. 222 Marta Lorente Sari\u00f1enaexplained if we accept that the weakness of general legislation was a key feature of the Spanish and American nations. This weakness might be veri ed through the analysis of 19th-century legal practices, which were really old. The creation of laws remained encased in ancient formalities; petitions or ancient that once paralyzed their enforcement i n the entire Hispanic sphere contin- u e dt ob ei nf o r c ea n dp r o v e dt ob ee ffective as well. At the same time, courts, as well as civil and military administrators, continued to enjoy free-dom to determine what should be used in court or executed in each case. A crucial question must be added to the foregoing: Against this backdrop, where the impossible assimilation of a formal concept of law prevailed, who was actually in charge of executing the law ? It is in this regard that another excep- tion legal culture. The adventure that began in 1808 with the separation of powers ended almost where it had face sim- ilar obstacles for many decades both in Spain and in the di fferent American nations. At this stage, several questions may be posed: When was an end put not so much to the vestiges of the legal order of the Monarchy but to its structuring nature of the new 19th-century orders in both hemispheres? Was there enough room within the new legal orders for outstanding metamor- phoses, as was the case of the renowned Mexican amparo ? Finally, I am convinced that the comparative study of Transition Law is a real challenge for legal historiography. It may well be included in the list of appealing issues for the development of New Horizons for the study of Colonial Law, which, inter alia , may explain the causes for the high standing that Court Regulations still enjoy in the Republic of Chile.

The Established Point of View and the New Approach The historical study of local and provincial derecho indiano examined across a regional situation peripheral to the Spanish monarchy pertains to the dis- ciplinary eld of legal history and is socio-legally oriented. It extends to any experience or knowledge related to the legal phenomenon. Therefore, inter-est lies not only in the normative and doctrinal system, but also in the set of habits of mind and style that encompasses both the actions of legal operators and the expressions found in daily practice due to the action and behavior of different social groups. Socio-legal experiences should be incorporated with- in the framework of what may be termed local legal culture. Most legal historiographical studies on the derecho indiano have rested on the assumption that power was established or that law was created at the upper and central levels of a consolidated order. The image of a unitary derecho indiano imposed from the Peninsula, which was perceived to have one general normative power, was accepted by an ample section of the American historiography and spread through cultural spheres. This image met the aspirations of the Enlightenment and, later, those of the liberal political theory of the 19th century, according to which power resided in the State as the central body bringing together other institutions and law was general and uniform. Most histori ans and jurists read and interpreted under this and hence reaffirmed that model. This was the approach that prevailed during most of the 20th century. Historians applied the contemporary state model when studying the past, which implied viewing the law as a system legislative power, evidenced mainly by uniform and complete bodies of law upon which a dogmatic legal system was constructed. From this perspective, Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 235thederecho indiano was recreated as a legal system established by the central bodies of the monarchy which culminated in the Recopilaci\u00f3n de Leyes de Indias of 1680 [Compilation of the Laws of the Indies], a compilation of the entire body of basic law to be applied in the Americas. Underneath this compiling normative system, a particular, changing and casuistic local or \"creole\" law was hidden. It was issued by the authorities residing in the Indies by virtue of the power delegated to them by the Metropolis, and it was subject to the mechanism of royal assent. The most writings of the mid-20th century traditional legal historiography of the Indies have always re flected awareness that the legal complexity of the Indies was not circumscribed to dogmatic forms. Hence, early experts - Rafael Altamira and Ricardo Levene, and more mod- ern ones Alfonso Garc\u00eda Gallo, Ricardo Zorraqu\u00edn Bec\u00fa, Jos\u00e9 M. Mariluz Urquijo and Ismael S\u00e1nchez Bella - perceived such interest in studying the local legislation, and even set it as a future research goal, signaling some of the most valuable sources for the task. However, local rules that they were regarded as merely supplementary and of lesser relevance. This view started to change gradually and decisively as the initiative to revise those paradigms was set in motion in the last decades of the century. New historiographical approaches emerged, some placing value on the political-legal autonomy of the peripheral regions from the central Hespanha). Consequently, the centralized and uniform con- ception of the of multi- human realities bundled in the Americas, which obviously could not be reflected in a uniform legal body. Cities began to assume a major role in the creation and application of a system of their own (Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero). On the basis of variety and Spanish American casuistry, it was necessary to attend to the realities and interplay of a multiplicity of jurisdictional and normative powers that contributed to the development of a peculiar and local provin-cial system. Thus began to open a new path of theoretical studies and eldwork, in which local law was neither merely supplementary nor limited to an isolated area of the derecho indiano : rather is has adquired a level of importance undreamt-of before, to the extent that it has come to o ffer a novel approach to study the whole legal system in force in Spanish American. Furthermore, in this approach this local law is a core element in the continuity of the legal 236 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiculture of the Indies a fter the emancipation, during the so-called period of derecho patrio or national law of Spanish American countries, until the time of codi cation. Aided by the new theories of recent times the decline of the former political paradigm, other images are emerging nowadays that depict a multi- ple and boundless derecho indiano born in di ffe r e n tp l a c e so ft h eN e wW o r l d , respondent to the and human realities vast make it possible to recognize the existence of diverse local and provincial normative systems. A new approach (based upon Antonio M. Hespanha's model criterion) the inversion possibility that local areas might be genuine sources of power and creation of law. This inescapably leads to the reconsideration of old assumptions and to the awak- ening of brand-new ideas about the 'center-periphery' axis and the existence of multiple jurisdictional and normative powers which sometimes work simultaneously at levels of this vast political entity, as well as the nature of the di fferent laws (socio-legal systems) that were present in it, margins of autonomous expression and centralized legal phenomenon arises as a new instrument to learn more about thederecho indiano and, in a sense, to deeply understand the mech- anisms of articulation in that political entity of great territorial dimensions: the Hispanic monarchy of Spain and the Indies during the Modern Age. Despite the considerable historical-political and These are real legal historiographical problems that call for new light to be shed in order to reach a satisfactory and comprehensive understanding of both its structure and historical development throughout the three long centuries of its exis-tence. In this sense, the approach suggested here may contribute to a deeper understanding. The speci c framework of this approach is limited to a particular space and time: the provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata, Tucum\u00e1n and Cuyo from the 16th to the 18th as peripheral to the centers of political power - Madrid, Lima and Charcas - until the creation of the Viceroyalty in 1776, when their status was Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 237put on a par with that of other peripheral regions of higher rank within the monarchy. The matter will be addressed in key areas or subjects of that local law. This approach will help revise, adjust and modify, if applicable, the conceptual framework. It will also pave the way for future research in other areas, and for a deeper and more comprehensive an alysis of the areas considered here, so that local law will progressively achieve scienti c consistency. II. Research Design. Research Work Areas T h el e g a lc u l t u r eo ft h eI n d i e sc a n n o tb ec o n c e i v e da st h em e r en o r m a t i v e reflection of a Spanish America geographically integrated with a monarchy based in Europe, nor can it be identi ed passive acceptance of metro- politan contrary, it is essential that we understand that derecho indiano was still in force far beyond political emancipation, and that while its structure had general characteristics perceivable across the whole Indies, speci c regional and local varieties emerged that were the result of different geographical, social and economic realities. In other words, it has c o m et h et i m et oc o n s i d e ro u t d a t e dt h e s e old historiographical tendencies, under which the study of the derecho indiano was limited to its normative system and questions almost exclusively related to legal creation by an almighty political authority residing in the metropolis. This retrospective view now gives way to the image of a more flexible and multiple derecho indiano , which emerged from a diversity of geographical and human ities. Hence, it is convenient to limit the scope of the research program to a particular geographical area, without precluding its broader placement with- in the legal culture of the Indies and its focus on comparative history across different regions. T h ec e n t r a lp r e m i s ec o n s i s t si np l a c i n gf o c u so na na r e aw h i c h ,c o n c e i v e d as a natural formation, served as a setting for the display, on various levels and by a multiplicity of peripheral powers - difficult of mechanisms of action and the simultaneous resist-ance to royal authority, which was indi within that those in charge of the administration of provincial and local law, rather than mere recipients of graciously delegated power, acted as real 238 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiguardians of alternative authority. This image undermines the credibility of the classic reductionist views, under which the monarchy would appear as the sole power vested with legitimate authority to make laws. The areas to be studied in particular must be carefully selected taking into consideration the nature of the topic, its local roots, and the availability of experts in the eld recognized for their previous knowledge of the subject, who might allow the conclusions of their research to be integrated to the common project. In order to advance in the knowledge of this provincial and local law, six key study topics have been set as speci c objectives. The goal is to detect elements in them through which local features can be veri ed and analyzed. These topics are: (1) the political condition in the city and the province; (2) the local normative fabric; (3) jurisdictional culture and justice; (4) family and household order; (5) the concept of property and the exploitation of natural resources; and (6) the relation between the universal and the partic-ular in canon law. Some of these topics are now being examined in a number of research projects, whose ndings reveal the value of delving into the material and disseminating the analysis so that new elements shaping the local legal culture begin to emerge. 1. The political condition in the city and the province The root of the local system lay in the city - city meaning \"republic\" and \"corporation\" - with its own entity and exclusive law. Both the urban region and the contiguous rural area were under its jurisdiction. Among the con-stituents of the associations, schools, consulates stood out at the lower level, each with their rules and regulations, bene ts and exemptions, customs and traditions, chiefs, prelates and governors. When Castillo de Bovadilla stated that \"houses are small cities and cities are big houses, \" he was picturing the basic layers constituting that local system. The political, economic, and judicial authority was vested in the Cabildo and the royal official, which acted as guardians of corporations and people. Their normative activity extended mainly o ver the public sphere, more or less intensely depending on time and place. Working from more general layouts of the political Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 239gathered that may help ren et h ew a yt h ei s s u ei sa d d r e s s e da n dv e r i f y whether or not there is a correspondence with those layouts, and to what an extent they should be modi ed or nuanced. Most importantly, this process will go hand in hand with new historio- graphical approaches that, without order, whose powers were spread among recognized centers authority peripheries, monarch played a preeminent yet not dominant role. This new view seems to be in better accordance with the analysis of a reality where the vastness, variety, and speci city of its elements, together with the distance that lay between the provinces and the Crown, precluded the everyday exercise of government the approach leads us to consider di fferent mechanisms of power, from the one present in clientelism an d corporatism to that produced by bureaucracy this intertwined subtle links changed ing on the circumstances. It is thus more proper to talk about a horizontal, rather than a vertical, order in the conception of power, and recognize the existence of elds of action reserved to each sphere of power. This can be veri ed by the relation between the local authorities in the provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata and Tucum\u00e1n with the king and the Pen-insular bodies. As I have observed while studying the consultations of the Consejo de Indias [Council of the Indies], the C\u00e1mara [Chamber of the Indies] and the Junta de Guerra [Board of War] during the 17th century, the matters they people, leaves of absence travel, foreign trade control, and defense of territory. A strong in judicial a ffairs can also be when serious cases of vio- lence, abuse or excess of power by magistrates and governors were reported. The practical exercise of authority by the monarch can thus be limited to certain areas and situations, and it becomes selective and eminent. The remaining power is distributed between the Spanish American centers and peripheries (Lima, Charcas, Santiago de Chile for Cuyo, etc.). The city wields considerable normative and jurisdictional power. A description of what fell under the charge of the Cabildo is recorded in a Buenos Aires council minute of the year 1674, during the course of a power 240 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguidispute. The passage is very suggestive and requires an extensive study, impos- sible to carry out in this paper for reasons of space. Its rst part reads: \"Cabildos (...), under their royal laws and ius commune , are vested with the power to rule the city and hear matters pertaining to it, by governing each and every part of it, paying attention to the protection of its fruits and crop elds, its sustenance and that of its people, peacefulness, price, amounts, and better distribution, in such way as they may agree at any time, and deciding whatever they may deem convenient (...). \" New examples and texts can contribute to the treatment of this matter. 2 . T h el o c a ln o r m a t i v ef a b r i c When we consider that prior to the nineteenth century there was a world of diverse and autonomous powers - supernatural, natural and human -, in which norms were created processes carried it is easier to understand how law was classi ed in the principal Castilian vocabularies of the early modern age. Two of the seven categories, speci cally concerned the local sphere, which thus appeared as a genuine source of power and of law, and not merely as a power delegated by another higher sphere. These two categories were the law ordained by the city or town for its private government and that intro-duced by custom. However, the di fferent matter, people, and circumstances. Provincial and local law were far from being comprehensive and exclusive. On the contrary, they were open to laws and customs of other places and spheres of power. It is diffi cult to de ne local law because there is no exclusive sector that may actually be so designated. The approach a city, province or kingdom, analyzing the fabric of the legal system from the bottom up, watching its development and verify-ing its possibilities to peak or decline. That is to say, a study of this kind is limited to certain geographical areas, and there should be no immediate intention of expanding the results obtained to all the Spanish Indies. In his research of the city as a general concept, and Seville in particular, between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero notes the absence \"a general system\" organ- ization. Nor there a legislative power that could establish the rules to Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 241govern the city. What did stand out as an organic whole was the intellectual power of ius commune and moral theology case \"laid down principles, formulated guidelines construction. In addition, there were other normative levels, some closer to what we now understand as law, other levels of a decidedly moral nature, and some that we could classify as socio-legal practices, with separate legal entity lies a customary back- ground that \"calls for historiographical creative space. \" This same universe of multiple norms - laws, customs and practices -, both written and oral, is a topic deserving patient and intelligent research. Seville can be used as a model for a Spanish American city. And indeed, over the centuries under review this model was frequently referred to. What was the attitude adopted by the central government of the mon- archy towards the mass of norms that wa s continuously being created in the different local spheres of its vast territory? The question is part of a funda- mental issue, which is the articulation of the di fferent levels of power and, obviously, the possibility to control the legal production of the peripheries. The Consejo de Indias suffered from an information gap regarding this issue and although there were attempts to ll it, little could be done to make local authorities in the New World send th e required a behind that question, lack an adequate response today, one with the necessary supporting documents. A working hypothesis could be the following: according to the governing style that can be noted in other matters, and given the material impossibility to control all the corners of its political domains, the Crown consented or and agement subsequent legislative provinces and cities enjoyed jurisdictional and regulatory powers that could not be ignored as long local or provincial authorities continued to recognize and maintained their loyalty toward the political authority in the This the issue that deserves the undivided attention of researchers today to grasp the way in which such implementation of law was understood in local life, such implementation being an intertwined fabric of case law/legal knowledge and solutions arising from the local socio-legal experience. 242 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1tegui3. Jurisdictional culture and justice In the research design of a program of this nature, a thematic approach to the issue stated in the attempt such an recent work by Alejandro Ag\u00fcero , in which he sets out the conceptual bases of a study on the topic, whose working hypothesis may be Ag\u00fcero means \"a form of management which can be observed with sparse variations in every European political space from the late Middle Ages until the end of the eighteenth century. \" Underpinning that concept are the basic assumptions that social order rests on the idea of a divinely created universe beyond the will of humans (transcendent order), and the idea of the supremacy of a community over its individuals that is applied in various associative expressions (corporation). There are other key elements, such as the primacy of religion in the discourse of knowledge, the relationship between words and things, and the validity of a topical reasoning. The legal culture of the time was thus structured on \"a discourse of political power exclusively linked to its concept of justice. \" The legitimate exercise of power was tied to the theological notion of justice that gave everyone what, as of right, belonged to them. In charge of said exercise was an authority that enjoyed iurisdictio , that is, it was vested with of jurisdiction. It followed certain rules of procedure and led to the resolution of the issue, b a s e do np r o c e d u r a lr i g o ra n dt h ev i r t u e so ft h em a g i s t r a t e . Among the various facets of justice, c riminal justice worth noting. Mario Sbriccoli laid out for the European world of the early modern period a slow transition, entwined by multiple archaistic and modernistic lines, from a \"negotiated criminal justice\" to a \"hegemonic institutional justice, \" which narrowed the room for negotiation and imposed the idea that no justice could exist without punishment of the guilty. The state started monopolizing punitive power by taking over the ment rigorously on the basis of four technical presuppositions: the law, the act, the evidence, and the sentence. This model can be used as a working hypothesis to study the world of the Indies in the early modern period. By way of example, we will refer to Alejandro Ag\u00fcero's recent work: a study on these forms of criminal justice in C\u00f3rdoba del Tucum\u00e1n in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This author points out the di fference between the punitive severity of laws and known practice. Ag\u00fcero nds Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 243discursive strategies and social practices that helped settle con flicts resorting to the rigor of laws. Clemency, pardon, and complicity by judges and ctims and perpetrators) were proce- dures that could be seen in practice. This view of criminal justice attempts to overcome a more unilateral view of that past itself, a consequence of the strong mark le ftby the Enlightenment. Another issue that can be addressed in this area is the one regarding the imposition that several local texts - particularly manifest in the bands of good government of the late eighteenth century - made on city dwellers: to act as assistants of justice in reporting or detecting di fferent violations of legal and moral norms that were committed in the city and in the country-side. 4. Family and household order In a study that has become a classic, Otto Brunner discussed with to the \"big house\" ruled by its master, who had power over economic activity and to protect and control all those living in it, including a broad right to punish his people and the domestic service. It was precisely at that time when - he adds - \"the absolute State, which had concentrated in its hands the protec-tion of peace and the police, penetrated the house. \" But thanks to the theory of natural law peace in the house was enshrined as one of the fundamental rights, and only by means of a court order could the power of the state penetrate its sphere. This is the same concept developed in the Siete Partidas ,t h a t\" t h i sw o r d family\" - it reads - \"denotes the master and his wife, and all the other individuals living in the household under his command, as well as the children and servants and the other servants. \" The father of the family was at the top of the small power pyramid sustaining the house, a situation that can be framed within a pyramidal relation as compared to the prince, the \"father\" of the territory. Alejandro Ag\u00fcero states: \"Disciplined by religion a n dg u i d e db yt h e Econ\u00f3mica ,t h ep o w e ro ft h ef a t h e ro ft h ef a m i l yw a s withdrawn from the rules of jurisdictio nal discourse to the extent that his was performed within an organic implicit in the notion of justice Anzo\u00e1teguiof mediating between various subjective interests, the function of the father of the family was to guard the interests of his home, 'manage' the assets to ensure the economic viability of the family unit and thus ensure the welfare of its members. \" This family scheme prevailing in Europe was transferred to the New World, where it underwent changes a nd adaptations as required by the new by the transformations brought about by the diverse processes of colonization which characterized the typical Spanish and Creole family of the Indies. A detail worth mentioning is the relevant role played by women when leading the family on some occasions, as stated by Dougnac, due to the Mario explains that \"in a socio-historical sense, a house com- p r i s e sac o n s i d e r a b l en u m b e ro fi n h a b i t a n t s :t h eh e a do ft h eh o u s e h o l d ,h i s wife, their unmarried sons and daughters, and oft en their married children with their own spouses and children; other relatives, including children born out-of-wedlock; those 'added' to the household, who also used to have off spring. \" G\u00f3ngora concludes that \"this is, properly speaking, a family in the traditional sense. \" The head of the household had a wide and strong authority that allowed him to exercise the government and supreme direction of the house, while women, children and the other members of the domestic community owed obedience and enjoyed free administration of assets and corrective powers over his children, etc. It is possible to learn about the rich and secretive world of the family and the domestic order, as it operated before the nineteenth century, by reading some passages from the bands of good government. Though their provisions are not too explicit, they are always suggestive. They are isolated or minor expressions because the power of the legislature only actually reached the gates of the \"big house. \" It is rare to nd such provisions recorded before the last quarter of the 18th century. The late appearance of certain precepts regarding the domestic order, resulting from the silence of the previo us era, probably serves to prove the condition of the \"big house, \" exempt from any jurisdiction alien to it in everyday life, where the civil authority could not enter. Texts of a di fferent nature evidence the privileged position enjoyed by the big house or casa de se\u00f1ores . The question arises as to whether a previous situation or whether they signal the begin- Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 245ning of a transformation combining (or rejecting) the intervention of the civil authority and the protection and guarantee of the rights of the individ- ual. Such contradictory combination of ideas or purposes would not be strange at a time as troubled as that of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. As can be seen from the foregoing, the issue o ffers cant research into the topic in one of the major cities of the region, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, in the last decades of the 18th century, which may serve as a starting point to further study or to extend it to other cities. Moreover, to the traditional gure of the \"big house\" house\" presence and role is less visible to the existence of a hierarchical society; perhaps it is mentioned passing in these mentions being derogatory at times, but deeply ingrained through customs and social practices. 5. The concept of property and the common exploitation of natural resources Whoever embarks on the task of venturing further into local law will unavoidably be faced with this key issue. European scholars of legal history, politics and social history (such as Paolo Grossi, Bartolom\u00e9 Clavero, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Maravall articles that receive special treatment research paper on the subject. According to the individual of assets, \" deviating from to the poor and needy. This preface can only introduce us to a very complex issue full of nuances and contradictions, as may be corroborated by resorting to the suggestive pages in which Paolo Grossi deals with the study of the historical forms of property and the big cultural debate on that matter in the 19th century Europe, or to the ones written by Clavero on the matter in the French Revolution. Both provide food for thought and an opportunity for the exchange of ideas. The referred pages written by European scholars do not include the dis- tinctive features of this matter in Spanish America so we need to resort to 246 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguilocal texts. Our aim is to attempt an empirical approach to that complex and sometimes contradictory world, where more than one line or path can be discerned, and where together with a Modern-Age process of innovation, persistent medieval traces can still be detected. They can be found in the wording of local legal texts but mainly in their background. The matter appears repeatedly in almost every place, but there are also speci c cases that ought to be singled out. A point worthy of mention is the one regarding the community of wild woods, quarries, and rivers. General regulations such as those issued in 1514 were coupled with royal decrees addressed to the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1696, 1708 and 1711, in which natives and residents of the Indies were granted the common use of pastures, woods and waters, and the residents of the city of Buenos Aires were allowed the enjoyment thereof, and could even cross the river to Colonia del Sacramento, for the exploitation of wood and rewood without limitation (Mariluz Urquijo). This system started to encounter weak open resistance depending on how advanced the con-ceptions proclaiming the individual an d absolute nature of property - which excluded all forms of collective exploitation - were. T h ec o m m o ne x p l o i t a t i o no fv a r i o u sn a t u r a lr e s o u r c e sb e g a nt ob e restricted by the eighteenth century, as much to establish their exclusive u s eb yt h ec i t yr e s i d e n t s-a n de x c l u d eo u t s i d e r sw i t h o u tal i c e n s e-a st o declare illegal formerly accepted practices or customs of common use, which were now de n e da s\" a b u s e , \"\"t h e ft\" or \"robbery\" . These texts must be read carefully and between the lines. In a chapter of the band of Buenos Aires Governor Berm\u00fadez, of 1715, it is stated: \"none be bold to commit wrongs in the in the eld by taking horses, oxen, cows, fruit or any other thing for, though trivial as it may seem, it will be declared the ftas the taking was against the owner's will ... \" It seems here that theftwas being introduced as a criminal o ffence to make a sharp distinction between the thing subject to the exclusive will of its owner and what could fall within the scope of an eventual common use in practice or, at least, tolerated common use. In these blurred boundaries between what can be de ned as an object of individual property or common exploitation, it is worth resorting to another text of the band of Santa Fe, written in 1709, in which the deputy governor expressed that \"because I am aware of the very serious chaos and lack of fear when it comes to the theftof mules, horses, oxen, cows, calves and other service animals it is not yet considered a venial crime , and that not even Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 247indoors can said animals be safe, I hereby order that ...\" no person \"under any circumstances may take livestock or animals of this kind without the express authorization of their owners ...\" The text recognizes, - highlighted in italics -, the existence of a practice or use not typi ed as a crime that the new rule purports to change, by considering it the ftand prescribing an express penalty. This was an attempt to sketch out an order in which the individual property of things was becoming more clearly de ned. The idiomatic turn used in provision to establish the requirement to obtain express authorization from the owner to take a livestock leads us to infer that the person did not have the intent to claim ownership over the livestock, but rather to use it temporarily as some-thing available for common use. A very clear example can be found in an order issued by the Cabildo of San Luis in 1779, which reads: \"All individuals shall refrain from stealing fruit shall be subject to the same penalty. \" This is neither the place nor the time to engage in certain digressions, but this order to refrain from a \"common practice, \" which is then treated as stealing and later extended to cover other acts of burglary of farms or the ft of fruits, seems suggestive. It gives the impression that we are text pinpointing, by means of highlighted words, moments between elements and a stricter privacy and exclusivity in the use of individual property. 6. The relation between the universal and the particular in canon law T h e r ea r ef e wa r e a so fl a wt h a th a v eb e e na ss i g n i cant to the everyday lives of the men and women of the Old Regime as canon law. Its rules governed life and death, accompanying people from baptism to extreme unction. On the periphery of the Empire in particular, the priest was o ften the only lawyer, and law was taught solely at the seminary. Notwithstanding this great nor-mative dating from the Middle Ages, intended for the faithful as a whole. This relation between the universal conception of these norms, de- signed to govern the whole Catholic world, and their particular scope of 248 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiapplication, with the required adaptations and adjustments, makes the study of canon law an enlightening experience for the program described. Among the various sources that can be studied in so far we have analyzed, uncon-scious intro- duced in an select and present the required material for jurists in a certain place. Some of the classes taught in courses of canon law at the University of C\u00f3rdoba del Tucum\u00e1n are particularly enriching in this context and have been recently, among them a treatise impediments to marriage, the fruit of classes taught during the year 1734 (Silvano GA Benito Moya/Guillermo de Santis). This treaty contains disputationes on key aspects the possibility to analyze the abovementioned aspects about the modus operandi of the jurist in the Cordoba of the 18th century, comparing the with ensic practice. Thomas Duve has posed questions regarding the local application of derecho can\u00f3nico indiano , including to what extent the particular experiences of the implementation of norms in the Indies impacted upon the Old World. Thus, he states that \"the dialectic between the realization of authority in the transplant of the canon law tradition to the Indies on the one hand, and pluralization within this legal cul ture might even contribute to discover at r u e Atlantic dimension of Legal History, beyond the studies on the unilat- eral reception of the European legal culture in the Indies. \" III. Research Methodology The program falls within the discipline of legal history and, therefore, fol-lows its methodological guidelines, which were amended throughout the century. The long-standing debate over whether this is historical or legal science - o ften settled with eclectic criteria - has been overcome. The posi- tion of the discipline between History and Law generated interest and was scientically sound when Dogmatics was highly regarded in the legal eld, Provincial and Local Law of the Indies 249and the legal dimension was dismissed changed. That relation progressively changed as a stronger link between law and society was sought, and broader \"methodological freedom\" political science, etc. - and open up possibilities for the development of interdisciplinary work, while still acknowledging that Legal History has an individuality and a scienti co b s e r v a t o r yo fi t s own, which off ers its ndings to other areas of knowledge. A very noticeable consequence of this change has been an improved articulation between normativity and social reality. To achieve this, it is necessary to move out of the narrow scope in which enclosed notion other normative sphere than that established by the positive law of the State. In Antonio M. Hespanha's words,\"The most relevant criticism against traditional Legal History is not so much its formal- ismas its dogmatism .T h ef o r m e rm a yc o n s t i t u t eap o s i t i v ea t t i t u d ei nt h a ti t safeguards to be necessary models (and therefore ahistor-ical) derived from the nature of things or rational evidence. In contrast, the proposed orientation, in relativizing le gal institutional models, consider the study from a historical perspective, placing these models in the context of the history of cultural forms and, consequently, in practical the conviction that considered of scientic interest to the historian only those matters that the dogmatic legal scholar de ned as pertaining to the legal eld. From these new standpoints, it is interesting to admit researcher's horizon. This also leads to a true of the Indies\" unknown in past - instead of \"Castilian-Indian legislation\" (as has hitherto been usual), since it is a deeper and more comprehensive phrase alluding to a phenomenon that cannot be restricted to the legal sphere. It is useful to bear this in mind when analyzing local issues. Pursuing a research program of this nature, which falls squarely into the speci c discipline of Legal History, requires looking into and incorporating 250 V\u00edctor Tau Anzo\u00e1teguiconceptual tools and documentary and bibliographic material of other sci- entic disciplines that foster the of humankind and society.
