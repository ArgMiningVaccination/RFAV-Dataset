Designer of pioneering Perinatal Information System (SIP) to pregnancies and births in the Americas for PAHO/WHO 1982-2006. Active Simini Senior Member Simini was Bioimpedance Congress CLABIO2015 engineering congress can esti- mate thorax fluid/air content can esti- mate thorax fluid/air use was based on evaluation board OMAP-L137 (Spectrum Digital) and How- land current source.

A prototype to allow coaches to guide sportsmen during training, a mobile application to share physiological data in the cloud during exercise, a hospital risk detector based on tags, wrist and card IDs (CAMACUA) as well as a cardiac failure follow-up application with artificial intelligence (SIMIC) are described.

The simulation environment has the ability to adapt to national academic requirements, to improvements, all at moderate development and maintenance costs. As a feasibility study, we describe the simulator components along with a block diagram, indicating functions with high The includes reception of sensor signals, control of effectors, data processing, video and audio outputs, wireless transmission, control software and analysis of simulations.

Based on interdisciplinary work of Medical School and Engineering Faculty members, the new instruments and software tools satisfy clinical and research needs in Biomedicine, and they are available for technological transfer industry. development of the projects is proposed, using present day elements, devices and development tools, yielding cost reductions in 2017 of up to 68% in materials costs, after a mean of 25 years. All prototypes developed were and some still are in clinical use, while only one of them evolved into a commercial product, confirming the one-to-ten ratio of successful investment in risk.

Treinta anos despues de los comienzos de la actividad del NIB, este articulo presenta el analisis del colectivo desde la perspectiva de la continuidad de trabajo y de su consolidacion integral en la interdisciplina. Se exponen los resultados del estudio del que pueden extraerse conclusiones generales para el avance de la IB. Se detallan algunos elementos que promueven u obstaculizan la produccion de conocimiento interdisciplinario en contextos universitarios con la participacion de actores extra-academicos.
