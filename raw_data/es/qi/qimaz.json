Take my quiz & test your knowledge! [Take or many women is the go-to option for all female issues. it symptoms of PMS, thought a specific hormone imbalance, so contrary to belief, it may not answer to all ladies' problems. Let me explain. Understanding your hormones is in school, it's easily forgotten and misunderstood. So, the two main hormones are called oestrogen and progesterone. These hormones take part in a delicate balancing act throughout the month in order to prepare the lining of your womb for potential impregnation, trigger ovulation and then prompt the arrival of your period. Both hormones have an important role and if dominant relative to the other when it shouldn't, we can suffer as a result. [Still not up to speed on the monthly cycle? Read our blog for a step by step guide.](/health/periods/understanding-your-period-and-hormone-imbalance/) All women (even men actually) need oestrogen, but, in the wrong balance it is thought to give rise to a whole host of symptoms - and is even though to be responsible for many cases of [PMS and may need irritable or angry than sad) to go with them. If these symptoms sound familiar, then [Agnus castus is quite likely to be the right remedy for you,](/herbal-remedies/agnus-castus/) so many women are on the right tracks. Agnus castus gently helps to support the hormone progesterone. to think of progesterone as oestrogen's little minder. By supporting your progesterone levels you can help keep in check and nicely in balance. Progesterone dominance, however, is a totally different type of hormone imbalance which is thought to be affecting more and more women in modern times - the use of progesterone-based methods of contraception may or may not, have something to do with this. Although we don't advocate the use of hormone balancing herbs whilst on hormonal meds, when women eventually come off of them, this is often when hormonal imbalance becomes apparent and know that progesterone helps balance oestrogen, too much the other way and it can become overbearing and oestrogen doesn't stand a chance to shine. Oestrogen is important for supporting everything from [our mood](/health/stress-anxiety-low-mood/) to [our skin](/health/skin/), so too little oestrogen (ask any menopausal women) can leave us feeling low in mood, lacking in confidence, tired, it can affect our skin, and leave our periods few and far between. So, what's the solution? Agnus castus? Well, no, and Agnus castus helps support progesterone, so we probably don't need any more help on that front, what we want instead, is to support our oestrogen levels. [This is where by women approaching the menopause.](/health/menopause/) This makes perfect sense, as we know that oestrogen levels start to drop off around this time in our lives. However, we are now beginning to understand that younger women may need to support their oestrogen levels too.
