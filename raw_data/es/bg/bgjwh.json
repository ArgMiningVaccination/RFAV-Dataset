Even a small action can make an enormous difference when millions of people do it! overuse combined pressures, ecosystem services provided by nature such as carbon and climate regulation are threatened. Climate change is causing more frequent and weather events such as floods, droughts, fires and storms. If nature is more resilient, it will help Europe adapt to such crises as they occur. However, if societies in Europe and beyond be heavily impacted. Globally, 75% of and 66% are currently severely the EU, meanwhile, 81% of protected habitats, 39% of protected birds and 63% of other protected species are in a poor or bad state, and only a very small fraction of these has shown any improvement ( [EEA, 2020](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/biodiversity/state-of-nature-in-the-eu)). While protected areas [[1]](#notes) make up 26% of land and 12% of sea area in the EU, these alone have not been sufficient enough to and some do not provide full protection to nature. In Europe, it is estimated that the area of protected habitats in need of restoration is at least 259,000 km2, around half the size of terrestrial Spain areas, specific to stop declining biodiversity. Protected areas provide a legal framework to help achieve the long-term conservation of nature within a clearly defined towards a good condition. Restoration can take place both within and outside protected areas and may involve a combination of passive and active measures. Restored areas are not closed off from human activity and can be used sustainably. Protection and restoration can, but do not have happen in conjunction. However, both are needed for ensuring their 17 of the Habitats Directive (2013-2018 period)). More and more attention is being paid to these challenges. In December 2022 at the (Convention 196 parties agreed to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which includes the target to restore at least 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2022](https://www.cbd.int/article/cop15-final-text-kunming-montreal-gbf-221222)). In 2022, the European Commission also published a proposal for a new EU Nature Restoration Law. This proposal, which at the time of writing is being discussed by Member States and the European Parliament, sets an EU-level objective to have nature restoration measures in place on at least 20% of EU land and sea by 2030, and have measures in place for all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050 ( [EU Commission, 2022](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/nature-restoration-law_en)). The law is the key deliverable of the EU Biodiversity strategy to 2030, which was adopted in Commission, process passively assisting the recovery of The [EU Commission, 2022](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3746)). Nature restoration is therefore not a net cost. The European Commission estimates that investment in nature restoration provides a return of between 8 EUR and 38 EUR for every 1 EUR spent, owing to the broader benefits delivered through ecosystem services that support food security, human health and well-being, and climate mitigation and adaptation ( [EU security more exposed to crop damage caused by extreme weather events. Landscape features, tree lines, hedgerows and grass strips, also contribute to natural pest control while improving water nutrient availability for crops. This, these be recovered and sustained through restoration. Climate change impacts are being witnessed today in the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events such as floods, heatwaves and seagrass meadows increases carbon sequestration, and this will be key to the EU achieving its long-term climate neutrality goals. In addition restoration will also help mitigate the effects of 1980 and 2020 were responsible for 77,000-129,000 deaths in Europe, can be partially depends on nature both directly indirectly. urban blue spaces directly their availability and accessibility for people, with documented benefits for both physical and mental health, overall well-being, and offer space for health intervention' that can protect and promote human health and well-being ( [Breed et 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7308174/)). At a global level, nature restoration protects genetic resources which may be used for pharmaceutical or medicinal purposes, many of which are yet to be discovered. Furthermore, nature restoration mitigates the risk of diseases to protect and restore nature have been included as key elements of both global and European environmental policies over several decades. While action has been taken globally and by the EU Member States, more is needed. It has not yet been enough to reach the agreed goals and targets defined in these policies, or to change the overall negative trends complemented with a comprehensive approach to restoring damaged ecosystems \u2014 both inside and outside areas in order to achieve recent targets agreed upon internationally and In addition, the effective, ongoing management of restored areas as the initial restoration activity itself. Over the coming years, the EEA will work with Members States and EU institutions to help monitor and understand Europe's progress in restoring [1] defined geographical space, dedicated means, achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.'
