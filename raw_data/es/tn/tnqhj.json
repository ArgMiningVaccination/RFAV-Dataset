Argentina fescobar@exa.unrc.edu.ar V. thapsus present antimicrobial activity. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the ge notoxic and in bone marrow was detected in groups. The methan olic extract of V. thapsus at doses of 100, 300 and 500 mg / kg, did not produce a si gnificant increase in the frequency of MNPCE in bone marrow and neither altered the relationship PCE / NCE respect negative control. Th ese cytogenotoxic findings contribute the of V. thapsus and provide security in its or supplements remounts centuries decades [1a,1b]. The popularity of herbal medicines is related to their easy access, therapeutic efficacy, relatively low cost, and assumed absence of toxic effects. Widespread public opinion is that being a natural product, herbal medicines are harmless and free from adverse effects. However, the safety of their use has recently been questioned due to the reports [2a-2c]. biological variation, it is now necessary and important family of plants comprising over 200 genera and and are widely employed in and known. is abundant it is considered with 1 non cytotoxic concentrations [5a,5b]. Since this information is hopeful, it is necessary to define the cytogenotoxic potential to ensure the use of the extract at safe levels. The aim of this study was to determine the genotoxic and cytotoxic of micronucleus induction is the primary in vivo test in a battery of genotoxicity tests and is recommended by the regulatory worldwide agencies to be conducted as part of product safety assessment. The results of micronucleus (MN) test in BALB/c mice treated with different doses of the extract are summarized in Table 1. In all cases these results are expressed as mean (\u00b1 standard deviation).

The percentage frequency of MN in the groups treated with 100, 300 and 500 mg / kg of methanolic extract, which were significant increase the frequency of micronucleus in PCE from the positive control group treated with cyclophosphamide (Figure 2). No citotoxicity bone marrow was detected in the extract-treated groups. Statisti cal analysis of the proportion PCE / NCE revealed no differences in any study group. There were no sex-dependent changes since its administration in mice at doses of 100, 300 and 500 mg/kg, showed no evidence of genotoxicity or cytotoxicity in vivo . The extract did not produce a significant increase in frequency MNPCE in bone marrow and neither altered the relationship PCE / NCE respect to negative control. These cytogenotoxic findings contribute the preclinical V. thapsus and provide security in its use as herbal medicine. Experimental Plant material and extraction: Aerial parts of Verbascum thapsus L. were collected in San Luis province, Argentina. The plant material was identified by Ing. Luis A. del Vitto. A voucher specimen (N\u00b0 #514) was preserved and deposited in herbal library of the \"Herbario de la Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Argentina\". The leaves were dried and chopped finely using dried solvents: n-hexane, chloroform and methanol at room temperature evaporation of the extracts in vacuum at 40\u00baC yielded Control (-)100 mg/kg 300 mg/kg 500 mg/kg Control (+)0510152025 FemaleMaleMNPCE / 1000 PCEMNPCE NCE PCE a methanolic extract of Verbascum thapsus Natural Product Communications Vol. 6 (7) 2011 991 the hexane, chloroform and methanol extracts. single dose of V. thapsus methanolic extract (volume 0.2 ml).
