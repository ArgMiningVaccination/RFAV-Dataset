To subsidize fossil fuel consumption, countries about six times what they pledged to mobilize annually under the Paris Agreement for and low-carbon development. \"People say that there isn't money for climate but there is - it's just in the wrong places.\" said Axel van Trotsenburg, Senior Managing Director of the World Bank. \"If we could repurpose the trillions of dollars being spent wasteful subsidies and put these to better, greener uses, we could together address many of the planet's most pressing challenges.\" The $577 price of polluting fuels, such as oil, gas, and coal, exacerbate climate change, and cause toxic air These costs people the planet from pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, road congestion, and the destruction of nature ultimately resulting from the subsidies. In agriculture, direct subsidies of more than $635 billion a year are driving the excessive use of fertilizers that degrade soil and water and harm human health. Subsidies for products such as soybeans, palm oil, and beef cause farmers to push into the forest frontier and are responsible for 14 percent of forest which exceed billion poor people obtaining most of their animal protein from fish, it is critical that the world's fish stocks are restored to healthy status. The burning of oil, gas, and coal causes 7 million premature deaths a year around the world through the bad air that people must breathe. The burden falls mostly on the poor. \"With foresight and planning, repurposing subsidies can provide more resources to give people a better quality of life and to ensure a better future for our planet,\" said Richard Damania, Chief Economist of the Sustainable Development Practice Group at the World Bank. \"Much is already known about best practices for feat to entrenched reform, governments must compensate the assistance programs, like cash transfers, and should: - Build through transparent communication. - Give people and businesses time to adjust. - Show how freed-up revenue is being reinvested to support longer-term development.
