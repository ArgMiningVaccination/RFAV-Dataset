The endocrine-disrupting were measured on aromatase activity, a key enzyme the polyglucoside\u2014APG) concentrations 800 times lower than the agricultural dilutions; while G exerted an effect only at 1/3 of the agricultural dilution. It was demonstrated for the first time that endocrine disruption by GBH could not only be due to the declared active ingredient but also to co-formulants. numerous with GBHs not seen with G alone; moreover, they challenge the relevance of asociados Licencia Identificadores ) Articulos de INSTITUTO DE 101 Descargas: 101 "}
