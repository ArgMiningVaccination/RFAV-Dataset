This article addresses the ethical framework for placebo use in clinical trials assessing vaccine efficacy in pregnant women. Vaccine trial participants are healthy at the outset and some must be infected during the study to demonstrate the product's efficacy, meaning that placebo-treated participants are under risk of serious and irreversible harm. If effective vaccines exist, such risk precludes placebo use. This interdiction should be extended to any clinical trial of vaccine efficacy in pregnant women, because a demonstration of clinical immunogenic in well. product Resumen El uso de placebo en ensayos cl\u00ednicos es uno de los principales temas debatidos sobre la \u00e9tica en investigaci\u00f3n contempor\u00e1nea cuando existe un tratamiento eficaz probado. Este art\u00edculo aborda la \u00e9tica en el uso de placebo en ensayos cl\u00ednicos sobre la eficacia de vacuna en mujeres embarazadas. Las participantes en los ensayos de vacunas estaban sanas al inicio del estudio, y algunas fueron vacunadas durante el estudio para demostrar la eficacia del producto. Las participantes tratadas con placebo corren el riesgo de sufrir da\u00f1os graves e irreversibles. Si existen vacunas efectivas, este riesgo impide el uso de placebo. Este impedimento debe extenderse a cualquier ensayo cl\u00ednico de eficacia de vacuna en embarazadas, pues la eficacia cl\u00ednica demostrada en mujeres no embarazadas y las respuestas inmunog\u00e9nicas comparables con las embarazadas son predictores de eficacia en el embarazo. Adem\u00e1s, la efectividad del producto se constata en estudios observacionales realizados tras las campa\u00f1as de vacunaci\u00f3n.

Delving deep into this controversial moral issue of fetal rights and into the many faces and origins of fetal protectionism in modern societies goes beyond the scope of this essay, so, fetal protectionism is understood here a tendency towards prioritizing fetal over needs clinical research. Strong fetal views in as previously mentioned, the very untreated infections and other morbid conditions may be severely detrimental to the unborn child. That refraining from clinically this group may negatively impact the reproductive and fetal health. The strong fetal protectionism in research involving pregnant women was questioned by the 1990s and, to some extent, softened.

If a pregnant woman is not underage, no significant intellectual disability, and fully understood the risks and benefits research for herself and her assume framework behind conducting RCT in pregnancy is further illustrated by the fact that, depending on who is expected to be the main beneficiary of the tested intervention, unborn child's woman's participation. In a recent draft guidance to the industry, the Food and Drug Administration of the US shed light on this sensitive ethical matter stating that the consent for participation in the RCT should be given by both the pregnant woman and the child's father if the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit solely for the fetus , and only if that is the case, except if he is unable to consent because for pregnant women still face complex scientific and ethical issues. The use of placebo-controlled arms in RCT to test the efficacy of vaccines or prophylactic methods a in controlled trials The use controls RCT, effective and safe treatments for the disease or debated in contemporary clinical research ethics. One of the medical ethics is that physicians are morally obliged to offer their patients the treatment(s) believe to best meet their individual clinical needs. Physicians are bound to by the Hippocratic Oath \u2014\"to help (to do good) or at least to do no harm\"\u2014, a professional commitment that holds true for both a physicians' clinical practice their B. Principles of This medical research ethical issue was brought into evidence by a still unresolved debate on the validity and applicability of the research. balanced. Thus, according to the principle, clinical researchers must in a state of genuine uncertainty about the relative efficacy (and/or safety) interventions under comparison to render RCT ethical. The concept of equipoise was considered unworkable in research practice, so, a proposition to replace it with that of \"clinical equipoise\" was made, referring to a situation in which a collective professional uncertainty about the treatment alternatives would exist or, in Freedman's words, when there is the expert clinical community about the 2727. Freedman Equipoise and the ethics the disease/condition under investigation exist and believe that the new treatment under testing could also be effective, the use of placebo or no treatment arms in RCT violates if circumstances, the ethical constraints generally imposed on clinical trials. The World Medical Association (WMA) 2929. World Health Organization. WMA Declaration of Helsinki: ethical principles for medical research exception allowing placebo use when effective therapies exist, that is, if the placebo use is scientifically necessary and results in no serious or irreversible harm to trial participants. If RCT participants allocated to placebo arms take health risks and no prospects of health benefits trial's offsets the individual risks taken. The social value of a study depends on the foreseeable contribution of the data that it collects\u2014typically in conjunction with data from other studies\u2014to improve health care, public health and, sometimes, attenuate unfair inequalities in medicine. authors 3030. the risks and prospects of benefits for participants\u2014be them those allocated to the experimental or placebo control arm\u2014 must be clearly explained in IC form. Whatever might be the of proven effective and safe treatment option exists, any risk of serious and irreversible health harm is unacceptable. A unique ethical problem of RCT in woman consents for herself and the unborn responsible. The validity of consent based on altruism, and not on prospects of direct health benefits, that was given by a legal representative (mother) on behalf of someone else (unborn child) who is incompetent (or unable to do it), is a delicate ethical issue that needs further clarification. The general assumption is that the absence of reasonable prospects of direct health benefits for or anticipated fetal pregnancy. According to the FDA guidance draft, one of the key conditions to be met by a RCT in pregnancy is that (...) if there is no such prospect of benefit, the risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal and the purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge which cannot be obtained by any other means 3131.

Op. cit. p. 4. . \"Minimal risk\" is defined by the FDA guidance draft as the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research [that] are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests 3232.

Global physicians On the use of placebo in clinical trials, the DoH statement of there are proven effective treatments available\u2014which prevailed in the 1990s and early 2000s\u2014, to a prohibition by default with an exception that opens a door for their use under special circumstances, introduced in 2008 and in effect since then. The first revision of the DoH, in 1975, implicitly forbade the use of inactive comparators or untreated groups in any RCT when an treatment for the disease or condition under investigation exists: In any medical study, every patient\u2014including those of a control group, if any\u2014should be assured the best proven diagnostic The explicit reference to the prohibition of placebo controls appeared in the DoH's fourth revision, made in 1996: In any medical study, every patient\u2014including those of a control group, if any\u2014should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. This does not exclude the of inert revision, made in 2000, clearly informed that the prohibition of placebo use in RCT not only method should tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies the seventh DoH revision, the strict interdiction was loosened, and the use control in RCT, when proven effective interventions methodological reasons, the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo, or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. . Along the same line, the Brazilian Code of Medical Ethics also prohibits physicians clinical studies in humans using a placebo as the sole medical intervention, whenever an effective prophylactic or therapeutic method available 3535. 2.217/2018. interventions A basic methodological distinction between RCT on the efficacy of pharmacotherapies and those on the efficacy of vaccines\u2014or any other prophylactic intervention\u2014is that, whereas in the first case all participants suffer from the disease or condition to be treated, in the second case all participants are healthy volunteers at the indeed efficacious, participants allocated at random to the experimental arm are protected, and thus the proportion who becomes sick is test the hypothesis that a vaccine is effective, so the null hypothesis can be rejected or not by a robust statistical analysis, it is needed to estimate in advance a target (minimum) number of individuals, among those selected for the study, that must be diagnosed with the contagious disease to be prevented before the blinding code is broken for a preliminary (or final) evaluation of the study results. This is detailed in the World Health Organization's recommendations clinical KJ et al. evaluation of vaccine efficacy. Bull World Health Organ no intervention or an (placebo) to control arm participants implies in subjecting them to risk of serious or irreversible harm 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. that could be minimized or averted using an active comparator (for example, another efficacy). Therefore, the DoH's exception that would render the use of placebo controls in some RCT acceptable when comparators of COVID-19 to vaccinate control arms participants means taking risks of serious and irreversible harm that could be prevented. If a previous RCT demonstrated the efficacy always use instead 10.1590/0102-311X00007221 for any vaccine efficacy trial involving men and/or women, be them pregnant or not. Trials pregnant women are usually first tested in adult men and nonpregnant women and, if proven to be efficacious and safe for this population, an additional RCT approach is a precautionary measure since not only dataset from nonclinical studies\u2014developmental and be available, but also clinical data on the efficacy and safety for adults, for a thorough assessment of risks for the mother unborn Food and Drug Administration. women, mothers fetuses are spared from being unnecessarily exposed to interventions likely to be ineffective for them as well. As far as a vaccine or another prophylactic method is concerned, the inclusion of placebo or no groups in designed primarily placebo-recipient mothers and their fetuses to a significant risk of serious and irreversible harm, if the trial duration is sufficiently short, concomitant non-pharmacological soon as possible after the trial blinding code is broken and the obtained data can be analyzed. In other words, if safety and not clinical efficacy is the primary goal of the study, a somewhat higher risk for placebo control group participants remains but the excess can be minimized so the risks taken by control and experimental trial arm participants tend to be similarly low. The inclusion of no treatment or placebo controls in studies testing clinical efficacy of vaccine/prophylactic methods unavoidably subject healthy participants to a risk of serious and irreversible harm. If the vaccine (or prophylactic intervention) is indeed effective, participants allocated to experimental arm. In fact, some of the unprotected subjects must get sick during KJ et al. evaluation of vaccine efficacy. Bull World Health Organ prophylactic product efficacy is ready to be tested by a phase 3 trial in pregnancy, clinical aware proven to be effective and safe for adult men and nonpregnant women. Moreover, as far as vaccines are concerned, that, investigation should protect this specific group of adult women as well.

Assessment of maternal and neonatal cord blood SARS-CoV-2 harm is ethically justifiable. In this specific case, the control group participants are exposed to risks of serious health harms to confirm the protective efficacy that had been anticipated by previous trials with the same product, that is, that the immunizing agent being tested is clinically for health consequences of inactive comparators for nonpregnant and men.

Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. . Anyhow, since a placebo (or no treatment) group in trials of vaccine efficacy implies in taking a significant risk of serious or irreversible harm 3434. Paumgartten. Op. cit. p. 491. for control participants, be them pregnant or not, the exception opened applicable. Additionally, even if the efficacy of a new vaccine was not directly assessed by placebo-controlled RCT, the degree to which pregnant women are protected by this immunizing product (that is, vaccine effectiveness in real-world scenarios) assessed by feasible if pregnant females are vaccinated with product in mass immunization campaigns. For example, an observational longitudinal study involving vaccination campaign took place in Israel 4444. Dagan N, Barda N, Biron-Shental T, Makov-Assif M, Key C, Kohane IS et al.

Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA covid-19 vaccine in same holds inactivated clinical efficacy of vaccines unavoidably leave participants untreated control or placebo control groups unprotected, and thus at an increased risk of getting if available, an active comparator must be in these cases. We suggest that this reasoning should be extended to encompass any use of placebo in phase-3 RCT of vaccines in pregnancy. We maintain that a clear demonstration of vaccine efficacy for nonpregnant women and men, and a comparable immunogenic response in pregnant women is sufficient to for studies of vaccine effectiveness in scenarios of use. In addition to entailing risks of serious harm for no \"compelling and scientifically sound that necessary this case questioned. In a or prophylactic method is intended to be used nonpregnant and pregnant women, it is first nonpregnant and, confirmatory phase-3 trial is performed with pregnant ones. This order of testing is expected to better protect the mother and unborn child. involving population the clinical efficacy is determined by comparing data from a test intervention arm with those of a placebo control arm. As explicitly stated in the DoH, placebo use proven medical condition available. so, an active comparator should be used to ascertain the clinical efficacy of the test product. The 2008 revision of the DoH presents an exception allowing the use of placebo if effective treatment exists, if there are compelling scientific reasons to use an inactive comparator (or no treatment) in the trial, and only if the placebo use does not imply in exposing trial participants to risks of serious and/or irreversible harm. When a trial is performed to investigate the clinical efficacy of a vaccine, participants allocated to a placebo control arm, pregnant or not, unavoidably exposed to the infectious agent\u2014they remain unprotected\u2014and, consequently, to risks of there are proven effective and safe vaccines, using an active inactive one is an ethically mandatory procedure. In this article, we defend that an ethical concern on the use of placebo exists, even if there is no vaccine demonstrated to be clinically effective in pregnant women. As part of a stepwise clinical research, the clinical efficacy of occurs and safety nonpregnant women. Moreover, by the time tests in pregnant women begin, clinical efficacy and safety for nonpregnant women and men has already been demonstrated, in addition to the availability of nonclinical and clinical data on the safety for pregnant women, and on the magnitude of the immunogenic response induced in this population, a to light: Would it pregnant pose their nonpregnant counterparts bolsters the argument that placebo use in trials vaccine efficacy in pregnancy is unethical. Finally, we emphasize that the efficacy and safety of a vaccine for pregnant women can be reliably assessed by observational studies the product pregnancy E. Unfair and health care.
