La hipertensi\u00f3n arterial es un factor de riesgo cardiovascular y renal modificable. Aunque la mayor\u00eda de los resultados adversos ocurren en la edad adulta, la hipertensi\u00f3n arterial puede estar presente en etapas tempranas de la vida. Mientras pocos cuestionan la importancia de implementar medidas para identificar y manejar esta afecci\u00f3n en personas adultas, se ha prestado relativamente poca atenci\u00f3n al problema de la hipertensi\u00f3n arterial en ni\u00f1os y adolescentes. Conocer los or\u00edgenes de la hipertensi\u00f3n arterial es un tema que cada vez est\u00e1 m\u00e1s presente en los foros de debate. En este sentido, es absoluta la necesidad de una acci\u00f3n paneuropea con el fin de profundizar en los conocimientos sobre la prevenci\u00f3n, el diagn\u00f3stico y el tratamiento de la hipertensi\u00f3n arterial en ni\u00f1os y adolescentes. En particular, existen algunas \u00e1reas urgentes de intervenci\u00f3n tales como la definici\u00f3n de hipertensi\u00f3n, su prevalencia en Europa, la medici\u00f3n precisa para la identificaci\u00f3n temprana de valores anormales, la evaluaci\u00f3n del da\u00f1o org\u00e1nico mediado por la hipertensi\u00f3n y c\u00f3mo llevar a cabo estrategias de prevenci\u00f3n. Con el fin de proporcionar respuestas a todas estas preguntas, la Comisi\u00f3n Europea ha aprobado y financiado una Asociaci\u00f3n de Cooperaci\u00f3n Europea en Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (COST). La COST financia la creaci\u00f3n de redes de investigaci\u00f3n, que en nuestro caso promover\u00e1n actividades coordinadas y colaborativas sobre los problemas que presenta la hipertensi\u00f3n arterial en ni\u00f1os y adolescentes. High Blood Pressure (BP) is a clearly established modifiable risk factor for early disability and most of the adverse outcomes occur in adulthood, it become clear BP is a lifelong problem that can manifest early in life.

Therefore, developing interventions focused on underlying causes of this epidemic are of utmost High Blood Pressure (BP) is a clearly established modifiable risk factor for early disability and most of the adverse outcomes occur in adulthood, it become clear BP is a lifelong problem that can manifest early in life. While few dispute the importance taking has been paid to the high BP in children and adolescents. Therefore, developing interventions focused on underlying causes are The considerable interest in children and adolescents in the field of hypertension (HTN) [1,2](#bib0005) stems from growing evidence that mild frequent in children was previously thought. Longitudinal studies have evinced that it is not infrequent for BP abnormalities in these age groups to translate into HTN in adulthood, which emphasises the importance monitoring HTN in and adolescents has gained ground in cardiovascular medicine thanks to the progress made in several areas of pathophysiological and clinical research. Prevention could not an increase in life expectancy but also improve quality of life, reduce health care costs and help keep individuals active and healthy. Going forward, the progress made to date should inspire advances in research that could be translated into clinical practice. There is a pressing need for comprehensive pan-European action to increase the knowledge on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure in children and adolescents, the current scarcity of which impedes the development of consensus across different research fields and hinders efforts to introduce clinical practice. The scientific and clinical communities, decision-makers, stakeholders and society overall must face critical problems associated with high BP in children and adolescents as a cardiovascular risk factor. There are particular aspects that demand urgent action: the definition of in Europe, accurate measurement of identification of HTN, the assessment of hypertension-mediated organ damage and the development implementation of prevention strategies. In order to provide answers of questions funded by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Association. COST is a funding organization for the creation of research networks, known as COST Actions. In this case, the promote coordinated and collaborative activities on personalized adolescents an open space among scientists across Europe and beyond, and thereby give impetus to research advancements and innovation. In this framework, the HyperChildNET COST Action (Network for blood pressure research in children and adolescents, Ref. CA19115) is a multidisciplinary network with participants European countries that focuses on the urgent subject of high BP, starting its activity in November 2020 for a duration of 4 years. The core of HyperChildNET consists of a group of researchers members of the Working Group on Hypertension in Children and Adolescents of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), who have previously worked together in the development of the ESH guidelines for children and adolescents [1,3](#bib0005) in cooperation with other medical device manufacturers organized in a multidisciplinary network strive to gain a holistic understanding of the factors at play in high BP in children in order to propose and implement corrective and preventive actions of both global and local scope. The members of the network will collaborate through the creation of working groups to coordinate research activities and exchange scientific and clinical knowledge, research findings and best practices. In order reports, guidelines, strategy and action plans and research projects to contribute to the progress in addressing this challenge. HyperChildNET is the first initiative with a holistic approach to the challenge and that meets the necessary conditions the findings several groups working on the different challenges in activities coordinated through the network ( [Fig. following are some of the many ambitious achievements that will be shared with the scientific community: - Benchmark report of the different BP measurement methods values with guidance on for the main specific uses in children and adolescents. - Report of a map of BP values based on BP measurements and and 24-h office use merging the existing data. - Assessing the health care burden and cost-effectiveness of screening children and adolescents in Europe for high BP applying the new thresholds and reference values. - Guidance for health professionals on when and how to assess biomarkers and target organ damage, and which biomarkers and target organs to assess. - White paper on the prevention of high BP in children a with an emphasis on mHealth, for the prevention of high BP in children and adolescents. - Report on the economic evaluation (cost-effectiveness) of the proposed clinical and community-based public health interventions for BP prevention. All of these are part of a dissemination strategy that includes guidelines, online content and social network accounts and the development of a policy brief for the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the European Parliament. Moreover, the dissemination of knowledge is critical to the impact of the project; the network directly involves key stakeholders that will use the generated knowledge to achieve the established objectives. This generation and transfer of knowledge will also provide a breeding ground for the design of new research projects to be implemented at the local or international level supported by private and/or public funding, including European Union programmes (Horizon Europe, European with the aim of building and ensuring the future research community through young researchers in the specific field of BP in children and adolescents. The planned online and offline educational activities subject. Lastly, HyperChildNET the challenge, achievement of progress beyond the state-of-the-art, adding the value of networking to excellence in science and technology, with an impact on science, society and competitiveness and potential for breakthroughs and innovation. Taking the through coherent and effective work plan will provide the necessary tools for success.Funding This article is based on work developed by the COST Action HyperChildNET (CA19115), supported by COST Cooperation in Science and Technology).Conflict of interests The authors declare that they have no of [Appendix A Members of Kjell Tullus, details this article as: Lurbe E, Fernandez-Aranda F, and W\u00fchl E.
