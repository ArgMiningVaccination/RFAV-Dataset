Introduction Grains are integral to daily food requirements and are consumed in large quantities across Africa. Any nation's economic and social development depends on its food security. Africa is not left behind, as their livelihood and sustainability sources are agriculture [ [1](#bib1)]. Storage with chemicals is a common practice amongst African farmers and sellers of agro-produce [ [2](#bib2)]. The food problem in Africa is the lack of preservative mechanisms in handling bountiful harvests after short farming seasons. Global annual storage produces losses are estimated to give 10% of all stored grain, while in sub-Saharan Africa, it ranges from 25 to 40% of grain losses [ [3](#bib3)]. Africa has become more dependent on pesticides to preserve and store its farm products. The demand for these pesticides keeps increasing due farmers the use of pesticides as the best means of insurance in protecting their on pesticide [ [6](#bib6)]. Growing evidence shows farmers their be cases. These chemicals inevitably get to the soil due to dispersal through washing water, excessive application, and failure on the part of farmers to to and mortality to the diversities the chemicals permissible chemicals, they exposed in minute amounts. Although these chemicals are used for storage, some residues been discovered in cooked foods as well as in to stress [ [10](#bib10)]. About 50% of the pesticides involved in these cases have been classified as highly hazardous by WHO [ [11](#bib11)]. The risk factors associated with the usage of pesticides include but are limited to pesticides calls for questions, given the growing evidence that these toxic chemicals pose a serious threat to humans and the ecological systems and contravene the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals the ecosystem [ [9](#bib9), [14](#bib14)]. As of present, globally, about three tonnes used annually in the forms of these hazardous toxic chemicals on the farm and grain storage to avoid postharvest losses without being mindful of their dangers to human health and the ecosystems. Therefore, this review paper is on chronic of with humans. Finally, solutions and recommendations for procedures green, safer usage of storage chemicals in agricultural practices in Africa. 1.1. An overview rich carbohydrates and proteins [ [11](#bib11)]. It is a significant food source and provides sustainable income and stable employment for African farmers. Food grains are usually stored in the tropic and subtropics to provide food reserves and seeds an worldwide. Many food grains are destroyed after harvest to poor storage mechanisms. produce also suffers due patterns [ [4](#bib4)]. The food problem in Africa is the lack of a preservative mechanism for handling bountiful harvests after short farming seasons. And has nothing to do with the low productivity of farm produce. It has been estimated that global annual storage produces losses to give 10% of all stored grain, while in sub-Saharan Africa, it ranges from 25 to 40% of grain losses [ [3](#bib3)]. Grains produced are vital in the economic development of developing nations due to their seasonal nature and are preserved for a wide range of users throughout the year. For the stability of any nation's economy, quality food grain must be supplied to end-users to produce different products, marketing, and likewise available to the farmers for the farming season food grains the year. Since time immemorial, postharvest storage facilities have been a major issue in Africa, affecting African nations' agricultural output and economic loss [ [4](#bib4)]. African nations have different storage methods that are best known and practiced. Farmers' success storage applying the storage principles of food grains. The fundamental aim of grain storage techniques is to properly preserve and secure grains from insects, rodents, and microbial degradations [ [15](#bib15)]. 1.2. Common storage structures in Africa Storage structures house stored food grains to preserve and for climate factors [ There storage structures, [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC10126862/table/tbl1/). are. structures house the small size of farm products over a short period. It exposes farm products to infestation and contamination, usually from unrefined local materials. - b.Modern structures usually house a large capacity of farm products with improved and refined storage materials and conditions over a long time. Table 1 |Types food||Method storage in communities and has existed since time immemorial and has been practiced from generation to generation. Different storage methods are indigent to different nations, communities, localities, and [6](#bib6)]. food produced in facilities are moisture free and well-ventilated. In some African the facilities are pots or waste food grains severe economic implications on the farmers and the consumers, and in all, food availability is affected. The poor farmers are adversely affected as they spend much of their income on food grains. Therefore, it is caused by insects, rodents, birds, and microbial pests will be vital in protecting global food security. 2. Chemical-based agro-storage systems in Africa Using insecticides that come in with food grains requires proper understanding and evaluation benefits [ The major causes of the abuse of synthetic pesticides in Sub-Sahara Africa lie that most of the farm products are predominantly produced by poor-enlighten farmers who may afford the cost of safe many African countries, using hazardous chemicals in grain storage is part of the game because no farmers want to experience any damage to their grains by pests while ignoring the consumers' and high prevalence of pests is much higher, possibly due to its tropical climates. There are tendencies of infrastructural deficiencies leading to poor pest control systems [ [16](#bib16)]. The abuse of pesticides in food grain storage has caused dangerous pest control by multinational agrochemical companies daily, pest control practice food grains storage have eroded in African storage practice. 3. Effect of storage chemicals on the qualities of agro-produce Due to the physicochemical characteristics and chemical most are perishable and be easily biological, physical, and chemical agents [ [20](#bib19)]. Farmers use different storage chemicals to store cereal grains, which are costly and toxic. Some of these chemicals are not affordable to some farmers, and those that could afford them them, resulting in environmental and but noxious synthetic chemicals cereal grains. Storage with chemicals is a common practice amongst African farmers and sellers of agro-produce. Generally, chemicals usually to protect agro-produce from on cereal is of great concern. Studies these storage [ [26](#bib25)]. A high concentration of these chemicals may interfere and organochlorine the higher trophic levels, which the [28](#bib26), [27](#bib28)]. Pesticides and other storage chemicals potentially foster the rise of ROS in stored produce, which some studies have to postharvest enzymes [ [29](#bib29)]. Chemical treatment of crops [ [30](#bib30)] of agro-produce in Africa. Based on the chemical groups present in these chemicals, there is a possibility of the adduct (or metabolites) resulting from chemical the maize. In contrast, the fat content was highest in millet and lowest in wheat, with all the and an in microbial activities, resulting in the deterioration of protein duration concentration. These storage chemicals add to the bulk of the grain, thus leading to increased ash content [33](#bib33)]. The pH, Despite the controversy about their health and environmental safety, these chemicals are still predominantly used bans and regulations could majorly be due to poor or limited consequential knowledge of local farmers or wholesalers [ [36](#bib36)]. Besides the health unnecessary and excessive chemical pesticides, cheaper and more hazardous storage pesticides, and poor transportation and handling, have been implicated in fostering such negative implications [ effects of Effects organisms countries is stored and preserved outdoors with diverse systems. of chemicals to store grains, tubers, vegetables, fruits, and many more [ [40](#bib40)]. These chemicals inevitably get to the soil due to dispersal through wind, washing water, excessive application, and failure on the part of farmers to adhere to their usage guidelines. The fate and of chemicals soils are numerous, half-life could eventually get leached or swept essential part of the agroecosystem. They are home to many invertebrates and microbes with 400 studies on the negative impact of about 284 chemical pesticides on over 275 soil invertebrates have been reported in a systematic study by Gunstone et al. (2021). It was reported that these chemicals, in general, generally have about 70.5% negative ensuring the [49](#bib49)]. significant is the indirect negative impact of these dysfunctionalities of soil flora on plants and the rest of the agroecosystem [ [50](#bib50)]. Studies have reported the distortion be as a response or defense mechanism against the toxic nature of the especially when they are in minimal concentration (less investigated the effect of these handling the mismanagement usage in tropical areas have been insufficient [ [54](#bib54)]. The few available studies performed in the tropic have examined the aquatic ecotoxicology of some of these chemical pesticides. Therefore, it is evident that the negative impacts of these chemicals in the agroecosystem are heightened pesticides into more toxic analogs and increased pesticide runoff [60](#bib60)]. Apart countries, other these easy been to foster more and of polar [57](#bib57)]. Other predisposition of more ecotoxicity of storage chemicals in Africa, there have not been well-standardized ecotoxicological tests or assessments to examine their effect on floras of the agroecosystems properly. It is paramount that this information will foster a more informed policy on the restriction and controls of these pesticides mismanagement for storage of agro produces in tropical African nations. 3.3. Effects on the aquatic ecosystem Although Storage chemicals for produce, these chemicals seldom get into water bodies through vertical and horizontal transfer [ [64](#bib64)]. These chemical residues are leached or sipped downwards by vertical transfer foster these vertical transfers. Generally, running water washing away these chemical residues from the top surface of the soil into small and large water bodies is the primary horizontal transfer route [ [65](#bib65)]. of entry gain was by vaporization of some of these pesticides [ [58](#bib58)]. A report by K'oreje et al. [ [66](#bib66)] listed a few storage pesticides as a contaminant of emerging concerns in Africa's aquatic environment. The fate of these pesticides in the aquatic environment is the transfer of residues water invertebrates to amphibians, fishes, and or and On ingestion, apart from the acute toxicity or consequences, could ingest these bioaccumulated chemicals to consume fish and other aquatic life [ [72](#bib72)]. Moreover, the presence and impacts of toxicity agrochemicals used and traders use storage chemicals to preserve foods such as corn, millet, beans, rice, and other staples/cereals to avoid/reduce the extent of spoilage. Individuals come into metabolized, excreted, stored, or bioaccumulated in human or animal body fat. Some factors determine the extent of toxicity of individuals and include current health status, chemical type (especially chemical structure), quantity, age, sex, period, and path of [73](#bib102)]). In addition to the once exposed, they also have some chronic effects even if exposed in minute amounts. Even though these chemicals are used for storage been in ready-to-eat foods such cooked foods, fruit acute or chronic. While acute poisoning may be accidental or exposure over a short period, chronic toxicity is usually due to occupational poisoning or ingestion over a period. Also, it takes time to manifest/manage [ [73](#bib102)]. Some of the chronic harmful effects connected the use of chemicals for storage of agro-produce include but are the literature to be fostered by prolonged covalently to the of acetylcholine due to inactivation, which in turn affects the receptors in the nervous system via overstimulation receptors. The resultant can be traced back to exposure during the neuronal development of the fetus [ [79](#bib108)]. Many studies have evaluated the effects of these pesticides even at allowed dosage in animal models, and their (90 of neurological evaluated through the Morris water maze, elevated plus maze, and open field tests. Other biochemical and histopathological alterations in the hippocampus were reported at [80](#bib109)]. A a dosage and mg/kg, respectively, for 14 days. Anxiety-like behavior and amygdala-dependent fear learning were observed after the 10 days using the open field and elevated plus maze paradigms. damage and the amygdala were observed in the exposed animals [ [81](#bib110)]. In another study, exposure of male Wistar rats and hymexazol days severe histopathological alteration such cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum of MDA levels were significantly increased while and CAT activities of the brain decreased compared to the unexposed control. In addition, the transcriptomic [82](#bib111)]. 28 days. Owing to the results from these studies, there is a need for a re-evaluation program of some of the acceptable pesticides and their The concentration days caused similar as abovementioned as their detrimental activities on the antioxidant state, DNA, and level of essential elements. In their study, the experimental animals were exposed to the pesticide at doses comparable to the standard health-based reference value, 0.06 (ADI) and (1.30 \u00b1 0.17 g) compared to the control (1.63 \u00b1 0.15 g). Moreover, the glutathione level and the corresponding activities of its peroxidases in the epididymis were reduced [ [87](#bib116)]. In the same vein, Acetamiprid, was levels. Even at a low exposure concentration of 12.5 mg/kg for 90 days [ [88](#bib117)]. 4.1.3.

Some health concerns have been reported in both as agonists antagonists. As agonists, they bind to the by their production, uptake, and metabolism and may even eliminate them [ [93](#bib122)]. In a study conducted by with a dosage of 6.3-11.33 mg/kg BW daily days the organophosphate chlorpyrifos (100 mg/kg while LD50 229 was Albino/Swiss mice to deltamethrin at a dosage of 5 mg/kg daily for 35 days caused a significant decrease factors such as occupation, age, affect the level impact of these endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Age This because done during the early stage after fertilization and development of the fetus due to bioaccumulation in the maternal fat stores, which can also increase during lactation. These dysfunction have been in the use of DDT and DDE. Metabolic disorders like diabetes, increased Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases have been linked to the use of organophosphate [ [12](#bib12)]. The use of triazine has been associated oxidative cause peroxidation. Since fatty acids are toxicity Storage of products is essential to preserve them for future purposes - in cases of food scarcity. Pesticides are applied during food storage to taste, and shelf growth of bacteria, mold, and yeast. This is [99](#bib75)]. Chemicals in agricultural products could be into agricultural products through the different [102](#bib78), [103](#bib79)]. Pesticides are also used in packaging materials to the proliferation of insects, bacteria, and fungi [ [104](#bib80)]. There are possibilities that some of such chemicals, which have identified toxic doses, may directly or indirectly be incorporated into agricultural products and may severe threats when acute/short-term, long-term - due to constant exposure to or accumulation of the toxic chemicals\u2014acute toxicity results from exposure to the toxic chemical once and the immediate manifestation of the toxic symptoms. Toxic symptoms could also emerge within a few hours or 24 h of exposure to the chemical [ [7](#bib7)]. This effect could be local, occurring at the point of contact of toxicant with the body, majorly the skin. Local effects could also occur in the lungs if the toxic chemical were inhaled or if the toxic chemical was ingested in the gastrointestinal tract. Systemic effects occur if the toxic chemical has been to other body LC50 (lethal concentration 50) values, which is the amount of chemical in milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) body weight (b.wt.) needed to kill 50% of test animals incredibly hazardous; with LD50 between 5 and 50 are highly hazardous, while those with LD50 between 50 and 2000 are moderately hazardous. LD50 values of over 2000 mg/kg b. slightly hazardous, while LD50 is more significant than 5000 mg/kg b. wt. It following acute the skin due to spills during [7](#bib7)]. This is primarily when pesticides during exposure to chemicals differs for different skin parts, with the genitals and ear canal being the most susceptible [ [104](#bib80)]. There are three types of chemical-skin interaction: dermatitis - irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) or allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), allergic urticaria, and asthma. Acute contact tongue [ [112](#bib88)]. It was reported that exposure to about 5 g/L of deltamethrin fostered the development of paraesthesia of the legs, mouth, and tongue and diarrhea in an agricultural worker [ [112](#bib88)]. Other non-common folliculitis, and skin cancer, as well-written review study [ [111](#bib87)]. Food additives like tartrazine have also been linked with asthma, and dermatitis [ [113](#bib89)]. The antimicrobial include and flushing [ [115](#bib91)]. in vapors, aerosols, alter the bronchial lining tubes [ [113](#bib89)]. 4.2.3. Effects tract The first physical and biological barrier to ingested food exposure to chemicals used in food storage predisposes the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and gut microorganisms, referred to as the gut microbiota, to these chemicals [ [119](#bib96)]. These microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, mutually link with the host gastrointestinal tract. The most abundant phyla of developing the GIT, play a role in the digestion of fiber, assimilation of (microbial imbalance) could be due to exposure to contaminated which be chemicals effects of pesticides on the gastrointestinal tract include nausea and vomiting, as documented by the storage pesticides after Food additives such as pesticide application more advanced Saku disease. On the other Carbamates in death. 5. The use of natural products as alternative preservatives: how sustainable? Chemical proliferation, although and human health impact are still being debated. Several emerging alternatives are being developed to preserve agro products better and reduce the hazardous impacts of chemicals on health and the environment. Some of these solutions include using natural products of plant, animal, and microbial origins, as well as their nanoparticle derivative [ [125](#bib126)]. The use of the attention of many contemporary studies to application in post-field activities well as their relative health and environmental profile [ section summarizes current understanding of the use of natural derived products from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and algae. It hopes to examine advances that may foster their sustainability to become workable alternatives to chemical preservatives. 5.1. Natural preservatives of origin Natural herbs have preservative depending as a preservative and sardine significantly the count of Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteria, and low yield relative decrease in the level of malondialdehyde produced in this [135](#bib136)]. this 5.2. preservatives of animal origin Bioactive chemicals (LPOS) studied. The combination of alginate and LPOS was found to have a considerable inhibitory impact on these bacteria [ [137](#bib138)]. The activities of cathledicin against viruses, fungi, and bacteria mammals have been reported [ [138](#bib139)]. Chitosan is extensively metal ions [ [143](#bib144), [144](#bib145)]. Hydrolysates fish microorganisms their produce many substances that can prevent or inhibit spoilage and the growth of pathogenic organisms. Food-grade mos can produce a variety of chemicals that prevent the growth of other microbes. This is due to the microbial ecosystem's natural balance. The bio-preservative properties of nature-derived and from for crops produced in large quantities and for commercialization. Evidence has shown that the heat of this widespread of these toxic chemicals usage is more in Africa and many developing nations, notwithstanding their established health and curb the menace of this timing bomb. Highlighted in this section are some of our recommendations. - i)Reassessment of toxic effects of widespread pesticides in nations As early mention, Africa and many developing countries are still the dumping ground for many toxic pesticides, as evidenced in the PAN international consolidated lists of pesticides toxicities, many African and developing countries have abovementioned number. contrast, such as the United kingdom maintain a strict ban on about 195 pesticides from the PAN international consolidated list ( [https://files.panap.net/resources/PAN-Consolidated-List-of-Bans.xlsx](https://files.panap.net/resources/PAN-Consolidated-List-of-Bans.xlsx)). It is crucial and recommended developing nations reassess prevalent pesticides their - ii)Prohibiting the distribution of banned pesticides the distribution of banned pesticides is prohibited, governments of nations are compliance enforcement agencies or re-train existing ones to ensure that and easy into law to be a criminal offense, in which both distributor and end-users of such chemicals could be prosecuted if found guilty. - iii)Collection of obsolete stocks After the ban, the obsolete stock of toxic chemicals will be collected from distributors and farmers and replaced with less toxic alternatives. Compensation could be paid to investors of these chemicals who willingly submit their stocks immediately - iv)Focused and Public awareness campaign Focused group and public campaigns on social media platforms, television and radio media, publications, and magazines should be embarked on to create safety precautions. Other new findings information and health effects can be quickly Feedback from farmers can also be received to generate statistics that will better inform the government on alternatives to target their subventions and subsidies to promote a green and robust agricultural as as a wide-scale advisory system, can be very helpful in managing the usage/application of toxic agrochemicals for their farming operations. Alternative sustainable and eco-friendly systems could be thought to farmers and the adverse impact of the preservatives with common potential health concerns. Conventional food storage chemical challenges properties. Food safety has become a top concern and a top priority for many countries and governments. The globalization of food supply, the better ability to detect food safety issues, and the increased global demand for food all lead to a necessity to process more and more food. Today, in the century of speed, consumers expect food to be for consumption, not health and have a good shelf life. Plants and other phyto-derivatives are viable alternatives in food preservation, the stability of these items' proactive measures such as prohibiting of farmers and maintenance wide-scale advisory system the development and the writing of this article. </p> Data availability statement Data included in article/supp. Material/referenced in article.
