There's a hidden story here \u2014 one that is rarely discussed when countries such why countries such as Haiti often with toxic, destructive leaders. Power tends to constrained by institutions \u2014 and because more incorruptible people are willing to enter the political fray in places where it's safe to do so. The problem for Haiti isn't just that it's a country of broken institutions. It's also that broken men are often the only ones willing to seek power wherever presidents have a reasonable chance of being killed, exiled or jailed when they physically most rational, power-hungry a result, the only people who still crave power in dangerous political systems are those least suited to wielding it. Poor and find themselves in a fix its broken system, Haiti needs politicians who are drawn to serve the consequences. That's bad news for Haiti's political future in the aftermath of last week's talented the country](https://unctad.org/system/files/non-official-document/ldcr2012-bp1.pdf) in of result, even fewer good potential will enter fray. brain drain almost certainly just got markedly worse. In the United States, the end of a presidency usually sparks the beginning of a cushy life: designing a presidential library, raking in millions in sales, and a quiet retirement with an occasional diplomatic aid mission to countries (such as Haiti) that suffer terrible natural disasters. The same isn't true in many countries. As I've found in [my research](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-despots-accomplice/), becoming president in a poor, country dangerous gamble that often ends badly. For example, between 1960 and 2010, more than 4 in 10 presidents in sub-Saharan Africa [exited power](https://www.rochester.edu/college/faculty/hgoemans/data.htm) into exile, in handcuffs or in a casket. Holding power in Haiti has always been similarly perilous, with recent presidents being angry and impaled on the iron surrounding the and torn to pieces.\" disturbing record and thinks: \"Sign me up!\"? As I argue in my forthcoming book, [\"Corruptible: Who Gets Power and How It Changes Us,\"](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/corruptible-brian-klaas/1138725807) the unfortunate answer is that a violence targeting leaders causes more ruthless, power-hungry men \u2014 even psychopaths \u2014 to seek power in the future. To want executive power in a country where presidents get [gunned down in their homes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/09/probe-into-haitian-presidents-assassination-reaches-beyond-nations-borders/) by mercenaries, you usually need an unquenchable thirst for power, a streak of irrationality or \u2014 most often \u2014 a little bit of both. Psychopaths are perhaps the most likely to pursue such dangerous jobs, toxic violence. Because the potential pool of candidates is narrowed to those who want to rule for the wrong reasons. Then, once in power, even comparatively decent rulers end up clinging to power ruthlessly, because they know that losing power could cost them their life, their livelihood or their freedom. As they overstay their welcome to the dismay of the public or rival factions, they make political violence \u2014 in the form of a coup or assassination each time. no easy answers to breaking that cycle. But for Haiti to move forward, one lesson must be learned: The country will keep repeating its violent history until talented Haitians can believe it is safe to enter the world of politics and public service. Creating that confidence should be a top priority for Haiti's fragile government \u2014 and the international community \u2014 in the aftermath of last week's assassination. It will be a herculean task. But to get better leaders, Haiti must make it safe to lead.
