New forms of care through perspective of health care. And, as already discussed, it is a practice with a high level of recognition for its positive health results. During the process, there is an improvement in the transport of energy and blood through the established body-mind relationship, which influences the blood, the essence, body fluids, and the mind, essential to the human being. In this way, it is possible to adjust and harmonize the flows of Qi and the Yin-Yang of the body, therefore promoting health(66 Matos LC, Sousa CM, Gon\u00e7alves M, Gabriel progressively explored the results of this therapy in different target audiences, for example, people with advanced age and others with chronic health conditions that are not susceptible to transmission, in order to understand its influence in terms of health(66 Matos LC, Sousa CM, Gon\u00e7alves M, Gabriel J, Machado the physiology involved in the results of therapy, so that it is possible to develop what is known in the area regarding its relationship with the health of practitioners, a reason that encouraged the development of the present study. Practices that develop both physical and mental conditions and Quality of Life (QoL), such as the PICs, are the foundation for the search for quality nursing care, carried out during the sharing of knowledge between professionals and users of health. In this sense, there is an appreciation of their active participation in this process(22 Silva LB, Lima IC, Bastos RA. Complementary and integrative therapies: knowledge and use by nursing teachers in a Rev a humanizing movement for the integration of care, which covers its dissemination, as well as the act of making them legitimate in this context. Although the literature presents solid evidence, there is little use of these practices by professionals in the area and patients(11 Assis WC, Britto FR, Vieira LO, Santos ES, Boery Duarte CS. New forms of care through Bastos and integrative therapies: knowledge and use by nursing teachers in a http://dx.doi.org/10.13102/rscdauefs.v5i1.1008 in addition to optimizing the action of nursing in both care and health production, research that explores the results of the PICs, such as Qigong, with a focus on those related to nursing, are essential. That said, the objective of this systematic review was to analyze, in the literature, evidence about the benefits of the integrative and complementary practice of Qigong with regard to the health of adults and the elderly. Method The literature a Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), through its checklist of items and flow chart for the development of a SR(88 Liberati A, Altman DG, Tetzlaff J, Mulrow of this SR, the PICO strategy health. With it, it is possible to identify keywords on the subject. The strategy is essential with regard to the development of the search strategy for relevant primary studies in databases(99 Qigong have beneficial effects on the health of adults and the elderly? The research of the out the following databases: N ational Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health (PubMed), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature ( Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ci\u00eancias da Database (EMBASE); and Cochrane Controlled Register of (CENTRAL) - Cochrane Library. For that, descriptors were used, as well as synonyms, in Descriptors studies of the systematic review.

When crossing the descriptors, 334 articles were found. In order to manage the research studies, the Rayyan QCRI\u00ae and organize, The were pre-selected when reading titles and abstracts and, finally, they were selected for this review through complete reading in order to include them in the sample. Pre-selection was also carried out by reading the title and summary and, finally, selecting the studies for the final review by reading them in full for inclusion in the sample. Data extraction was performed by two clinical trial, and a summary table was elaborated with the following information for and interpretation of results); conclusion; and protocol records. Both the research design and the level of evidence of the articles were carried out, so that it was possible to classify them according to the evidence hierarchy(1111 Polit DF, Beck CT. Fundamentos de pesquisa em enfermagem: avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de pr\u00e1tica studies was carried out based on trial bias. It is a tool that allows for the assessment of several types of bias found in clinical seven three categories namely: high risk of bias, low risk of bias, and uncertain risk of bias. Such an instrument was chosen because it was necessary to analyze the level of the research methodology found in the SR, so that the results from the scientific evidence in the literature were reliable. Results 28 studies were selected that were compatible with the inclusion criteria adopted for this SR, and studies were not added from the review of the references of this selected sample, as shown in [Figure 2](). Liberati main authorship of the articles, 13 (46.4%) were physicians, a one (3.6%) was a physical educator, and one (3.6%) was a physical therapist. It was also noted that 15 (53.6%) of the studies were carried out in China, five (17.9%) in Germany, three (10.7%) in the United States, two (7.1%) in Sweden, two (7.1%) in Korea, and one (3.6%) in Thailand. [Figure 3](), presents the description of the studies analyzed in the SR. Description of the studies included in the systematic review, according to year of publication and titles. Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, SP, Brazil, 2019 All the articles submitted for analysis were published in English, and 21 of them were in different journals with a predominance (n = 24) of medical journals. Only one was not randomized, although all were evaluated with level of evidence of II, considered strong, according to the theoretical framework adopted(1111 Polit DF, CT. Fundamentos de pesquisa em enfermagem: avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de pr\u00e1tica de with the results. Bias risk assessment of the studies included in Brazil, 2019 In order to fulfill the objective of this SR and to conduct a comparison between the data obtained and the literature, the articles were organized into five thematic categories. The first was established regarding health prevention associated with therapy, in which E9(2121 Hung HM, Yeh SH, Chen CH. Effects of Qigong Exercise on Biomarkers and Mental and Physical Health in Adults With at Least One Risk Disease (CAD) (n = 139) and with a mean age of 62 years old, showed an improvement in perceived mental and physical health (p < 0.001), and also in the amount of body fat (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. Also, CH. Effects of Qigong Exercise on Biomarkers and Mental and Physical Health in Adults With at Least One Risk stressed subjects (n = 50) with a mean age of 38 years old showing that, compared to the control group, the intervention group significantly greater reductions in the perceived stress as well as a significantly greater increase in the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL scores (p < 0.05). However, the change(2222 Hwang EY, JH, Song MY, Fung KM, Chan AH, Chan EP et al. Psycho-physical and elderly people with chronic diseases (n = 38) and with a mean age of 80 years old, revealed that the intervention group showed a physical strength (p = 0.034). In addition, a lower level of salivary cortisol (p < 0.008) was found in the referred group(2323 Tsang HW, Tsang WW, Jones AY, Fung KM, Chan AH, Chan EP et al. Psycho-physical and = 46) with an average age of 77 years old, showed that Tai Chi/Qigong (3 months) as as the satisfaction component of the social support questionnaire (p = 0.044) when compared to the people in the control group. Another important fact is that 82% of the participants reported that they would continue the exercises, while nine reported that they extended their friendship circle, which indicates that the majority liked to practice Tai Chi/Qigong3636 Chan AWK, Yu DSF, Effects to S, Qigong or Yoga Versus No Intervention in With back pain (n = 176) with a mean age of 72 years old, showed no statistically significant distinctions in the groups regarding changes in the degree of low back pain during the survey ( Qigong x Yoga, p = 0.18, and Qigong x Control, p = 0.12). However, there was satisfaction with the Qigong therapy (7.9) and Yoga (7.8) and greater chances of recommending it to other individuals(1616 Teut M, Knilli J, Daus D, Roll S, Witt Qigong or Yoga Versus No Intervention in With low back pain (n = 123) with a mean age of 46 years old, revealing that there was no statistical confirmation of non-inferiority (p = 0.204) - taking into account the margin of non-inferiority of 5 mm considered by the research in question in the mean intensity of low back pain - from the Qigong group (n = 64; 34.8 mm) when compared to the control group (n = 63; 33.1 mm), with the practice of stretching and relaxing for chronic low back pain. The distinction found was only the fact that the Qigong group adhered more in guided classes as Pach D, Kaster T, Ludtke SN, al. pain in the cervical region (n = 122) with a mean age of 45 years old, showed a significant difference with the control group with regard to the degree of pain (p = 0.002). The Qigong when compared to the group, similarly when it comes to conventional exercises(2727 Rendant Ludtke SN, al. the cervical region (n = 93) with a mean age of 75 years old, regarding pain, lack of capacity, and QoL, no when Qigong months) and control (p = 0.099) groups, as well as those with conventional with chronic non-specific low back the lower back and working in offices (n = 62) with a mean age of 35 years old, showed an important reduction in the degree of pain and functional disability in the lower back (p < 0.022 ) for people in the Qigong group (6 weeks). In addition, important improvements were identified with regard to the degree of pain (p < 0.001), functional impairment of the back region (p < 0.001), range of motion (p < 0.001), muscle strength (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.001), and mental status (p = 0.005), in addition to better overall satisfaction with the practice (p < 0.001) in the intervention group(3939 Phattharasupharerk with chronic non-specific low back of the therapy in area of oncology, mean age of years old, pointed to subsequent physical and psychological benefits (12 weeks), as well as an important increase in the level of physical activity and cognitive function (p < 0.001). There was also a reduction in body weight by the BMI [-0.66 (p = when compared to the other exercise Lopez AM, Rogers CE et al.

In this study, an important reduction in fatigue was found in the Easy Qigong/Tai Chi group (p = 0.005) compared to the other group, maintained throughout the 90 days of practice (p = 0.024). In addition, there was an improvement in depression and sleep in both interventions (p < 0.05)(1515 Larkey LK, Roe DJ, Weihs KL, Jahnke R, Lopez AM, Rogers CE et al.

Qigong/tai sleep HW, JW, a 6-Month Tai Chi Qigong Training Program on Temporomandibular, Cervical, and Shoulder Joint Mobility 58 brought about positive results (6 months). The range of motion in the cervical region was improved (p < 0.008), and the mobility of the shoulders and temporomandibular joints did not change (p > 0.008). Worsening of the shoulder range of motion and of the ability to open the mouth was gradually identified in the control group (p < 0.008). Regarding sleep difficulties, there were improvements for the intervention group (p < 0.008), related to the development of the range of motion in the cervical region (p < 0.05)(3333 Fong SS, Ng SS, Lee HW, JW, a 6-Month Tai Chi Qigong Training Program on Temporomandibular, Cervical, and Shoulder Joint Mobility = 102) with a mean of 59 years old, also showing an important decrease in fatigue and quality (p < 0.001) for Qigong (12 weeks), provided there is a considerable practice period3434 Yeh ML, Chung YC. A randomized controlled disease (n = 96) with a mean age of 60 years old and submitted to the first cycle of chemotherapy treatment, also revealed an important improvement in level of fatigue (p < 0.001) for the intervention group, in addition to white blood cells (p < 0.001), hemoglobin (p = 0.002), and sleep You J, Loo WTY, Sun Y, He Y, Sit H, et al.

There were benefits regarding anxiety (p < 0.01) for the intervention group. The control group had benefits for depression (p < 0.05). However, no significant distinction was identified between them. Both groups showed immunity benefits; however, in the Qigong one, it developed in the degrees of tumoral necrosis-alpha (TNF-a) (p < 0.05) compared to the control group(3838 Liu P, You J, Loo WTY, Sun Y, He Y, Sit H, et al.

Also, telomerase practitioners was relevant compared to the control group (p < 0.05)(2525 Ho RT, Chan JS, Wang CW, Lau BW, So KF, Yuen = 206) with a mean age of 73 years old, improvements similar to other studies were found in the Qigong group (3 months) with regard to vital capacity (p = 0.002), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p < 0.001), and exacerbation rate (p = 0.006). This was not in conventional exercise group. Worsening of lung function was noted group(2626 Chan AW, Suen LK, Tam S, the treatment of tinnitus: tinnitus (n = 71) with a mean age of 45 years old, revealing that Qigong (5 weeks) improved tinnitus (p < 0.0001). Also, it possible to consider that the intervention potentially beneficial for the treatment of this condition given the great satisfaction of people with the therapy, as well as the stability of its effects (3 Biesinger E, Kipman U, Schatz S, Langguth the treatment of tinnitus: Y, Kim SY, Kim SN, Kim ST, et al.

Similarly, the group with people who practiced Qigong reported a significant decrease in anxiety in relation to the control group (p < 0.01), in addition to a benefit in relation to QoL (p < 0.01)(3131 Haak T, Scott age of 73 years old, showed an important development of exercise capacity (6 significant increase in the mean walking distance (+ 17%). A benefit for pulmonary functions was also identified (p < 0.001), an improvement in the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s 11%)(3535 Lee DT, Chen YM, Yu MP, Weng LC. Effect of with a mean age of 57 years old, revealed that, for the intervention group (6 months), fatigue was lower after 8 weeks of practice, with a significant decrease compared to the control group (p = 0.005). In addition, the research identified the benefit of Huang MC, Chen YM, Yu MP, Weng LC. Effect of Qigong the health network is revealed as a practice capable of promoting health, in addition to meeting based on the positive results demonstrated in this said, it is studies focusing promotion, since investigate people to the practice of Qigong, similarly to the findings of this study(4141 Lottermann PC, Sousa CA, Liz CM.

As for Parkinson's disease, studies in the area are in line with the results presented in this SR, proving that regular exercise practice, as proposed by Qigong, is beneficial for the rehabilitation of these patients, as it brings physical benefits, as well as a reduced chance that elderly people will suffer falls(5252 Zou L, Sasaki JE, Wang H, Xiao Z, Fang Q, Zhang M. A Systematic Review oncology, a prospective longitudinal research has shown that it is even possible to consider the practice, inserted in the lifestyle, as protective with regard to the reduction of deaths due to neoplasms, by in intensity research studies that aim to investigate the results of this practice for health. Therefore, an intervention protocol of at least four weeks is recommended, based on the results found in this SR. Qigong is based on the development of self-knowledge, making easily by very beneficial in the long term, as shown in the results of this study. Through the critical evaluation conducted, it was possible to verify a high risk of bias in the research blinding domains, since this was impossible, and there was a probability of influencing the evaluation of the results, which lacked adequate control or, therefore, a clear description of the protocol and analysis(5454 Chang PS, Chao AM, Jang trials with a high level of methodology focusing on this research subject. In addition, in order to assess the practice of Qigong, longitudinal research studies possible the physiological results from the practice of Qigong through the scientific evidence identified and submitted to evaluation, which makes this study of great contribution, since it brings a synthesis of the production regarding the use of an integrative and complementary practice in health, based on the most relevant scientific findings available.
