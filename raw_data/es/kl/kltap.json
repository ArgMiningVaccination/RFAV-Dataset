We promise the children being born today that they will live to see one hundred, but we are confusing medicated old age with an enjoyable quality of life. At the same time, it's been demonstrated that 90 percent of and environmental factors. Doctors are developing more and more cases of depression in the two years following establishment of their professional practices. Should our response to these paradoxes of the modern world be to maintain our comfort level with an ostrichlike denial of the evidence, or to hold an alarmist and paranoid discourse? Naturopathy believes that this picture, dramatic as it may be, can be studied calmly and solved positively if we can consumers most whose it or rests on the philosophy, points of reference, and points of view that determine human behavior. Most of the problems we currently face have their origin in materialistic the egotistical belief that humanity can or biology. Naturopathy's chosen objective is health and well-being, but in the framework of a profound and authentic reconciliation with these laws, which are often simple and full of common sense: How do we best nourish ourselves, breathe freely, and take care of our bodies and their natural elimination processes? How do we optimize our sleep, our vitality, and our libido? How do we recharge ourselves through the natural elements\u2014earth, water, air, and light, for example? Why should we carefully alternate times of activity and times of How can we purify and regenerate the internal cellular environment of our bodies? can we be consumers without endangering our planetary resources? Good sense such as this is to be found, in fact, where it has always been: in the heart of the great health-sustaining recommendations and medical traditions that date back to the fabled teachings of the Sumerians and the Essenes. This includes Native American, Chinese, and Tibetan practices, and more specifically for us in the Western world, Hippocrates' noble philosophy. The most surprising thing, perhaps, is that beyond the contextual differences in their details, all of these traditions are based on the same foundations, and only allopathic medicine (the institutional Western form that prevails in most of the world today) has been established in total opposition to these universal concepts. What, then, are the common elements in these traditions? is and giving the individual responsibility for his or her health is preferable to taking the laws of a healthy life, and working with the energetic processes of regeneration and spontaneous self-healing rather faith in the effectiveness of a remedy. In short, an entire program. After more than a century in the United States and seventy years in Europe, naturopathy has become the discipline that offers another kind of medicine, one in which the practitioner is first and foremost an educator of health, perfectly effective in quality of life. This does not make the naturopath just one more practitioner in the vast field of natural medicine that includes, for example, phytotherapy and homeopathy. He remains, rather, the general practitioner of health, as the allopathic physician is the general practitioner of illness. Is it now possible to envision the ideal public health system\u2014perhaps modeled after the integrated medicine practiced in some parts of the United States\u2014in which the allopathic doctor, the natural medicine practitioner, and the naturopath can congenially complement one another's services in an atmosphere of perfect mutual respect, all for the benefit of the patient? The French Federation of Naturopathy (FENAHMAN) states that naturopathy is founded on the principle of the vital energy of the body, and that it combines the practices that have emerged from Western tradition at preserving and optimizing the overall health and quality of life of an individual by allowing the body to regenerate itself through natural means. these concepts, a work of remarkable synthesis here, because it is no easy task to summarize the essence of our art, as well as its useful application, in so few pages. He's earned my great respect for his precision, and my sincerest congratulations for his teaching ability. In this work, we have the pleasure of rediscovering the essential keys of the five columns treasured by Hippocrates and all of our European teachers (Sebastian Kneipp, Paul Carton, Henri Durville, Pierre Valentin Marchesseau, Andr\u00e9 Roux), and North American teachers (Benedict Lust, Tilden, Henry Lindlahr, obstructions); vitalism, of our its invaluable capabilities (homeostasis, regeneration, self-healing); prevention, maintaining our connection with wholesome lifestyle; causalism, the methodical quest for the primary origin of symptoms, which always comes back to not only the condition of the bodily fluids, and holism, the global approach to the human being and the way he interacts with his environment. Thank you, Christopher, for this new reference work, and pleasant reading to all.

Introduction For many people, naturopathy distinguishes itself from allopathic medicine only by the remedies it These remedies are natural (found in hydrotherapy, and so forth) rather than chemical (created in a laboratory). In reality there is another stark difference: the naturopath has a completely different concept of disease from that of the allopathic physician. Naturopathy, therefore, does not do the same thing by different means, but actually does completely different logic. What is this logic? The purpose of this book is to present the different aspects of naturopathy by revealing the foundations on which it is based (theoretical framework), and by describing the means bring relief to the sufferers of illness (practical application). 1 The Naturopathic Concept of Illness WHAT IS AN ILLNESS? The Importance of the Body's Internal Cellular Environment It is rare for any person whose health has been compromised to ask himself, Why am I sick? What is really happening in my body? To the contrary, all of his attention\u2014and that of those around him\u2014is focused on his blatant, or painful reaction would to make a vigorous counterattack to the assault represented by the illness. As a general rule we behave as if disease were an outside entity independent of the patient, entering makes the we requiring bad The to speak of illness clearly support this premise. We say that we fall ill, that we have been stricken, or that we have caught a disease. as many diseases as there are assailants; this is what is known as multiple causes, or the plurality of disease. Since there are no common elements among diseases in this framework, each must be own specific remedy. vital forces. toxins the depths of the body, anti-symptom remedies do banish the symptoms from the surface, but this is to the detriment of the biological terrain. In naturopathy, however, all diseases are considered as different manifestations of a single, "}
