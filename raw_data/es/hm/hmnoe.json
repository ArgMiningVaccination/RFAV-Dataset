Background The WHO ordinal severity has been to predict mortality and in COVID-19. However, it has its limitations.

The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. this was a hospital-based study, the patients included corresponded to categories 3 to 7 of the WHO ordinal scale. Categories 6 and 7 were grouped in the same category. Key Results A total of 17,225 patients were included in the study. Patients classified as high risk in each of the WHO categories according to the degree of inflammation were superior to the two models separately.

Results: A total 72 patients were randomized and 71 patients were analyzed (34 in the MPP group and 37 in the placebo group).
