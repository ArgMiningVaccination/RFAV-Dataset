Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Quimioterapia doi:10.37201/req/149.2021 In this state of affairs, it seems prudent to administer sup - plemental doses to those exposed to a higher risk, such as im - munocompromised individuals and the elderly. On the other hand, we consider that this is not the time to accelerate, on the spur of the moment, a massive administration of a third dose to other population groups that are less exposed and at lower risk, without waiting for adequate scientic information, which will undoubtedly arrive gradually. We do not believe that this position is incompatible with the practical and ethical warnings made by the World Health Organization in this respect.

Data on the real impact of a supplementary or \"booster\" dose in the scientic literature are scarce for the moment and its application in large populations such as those in the state of Israel may be associated with a decrease in the risk of new and severe episodes in the short observation period available. We also sufcient data on the safety and potential adverse effects of these supplementary doses and we do not know the ideal time to administer them in different situations.

The following pages contain not only the scientic evi - dence that we have managed to collect on the questions re - ceived immediately, but also the opinion of the group where evidence is scarce or non-existent at this time. It should be noted that the vast majority of the information available at this time is that of the Pzer mRNA vaccine. 1.- IS THERE, AT THIS TIME, A LOSS IN THE DURATION OF PROTECTION MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER VACCINATION? The efcacy of the different vaccines has been demon - strated in post-vaccination obser- However, about the duration of protection, the vaccines was not detected. In relation to this, the need for a supplementary dose has been raised, making a speculative risks and benets, in some population groups. Months after the start of vaccination in some countries, da - ta are becoming available that attempt to these blinded follow-up phase of trials and BNT162bm (Pz-er) vaccines, data an ical effectiveness of over severe disease and around 65% for asymptomatic disease. Efcacy is lower for the 65-75 age group [2]. These data extend those reported in the clinical trial with the mRNA Pzer's vaccine in which follow-up was limited to two months [3]. Already in real life, studies in data servation time progresses, there are some differences related to age groups and in some cases to disease progression. In the Glatman-Freedman study [4], carried out in Israel, efcacy data were obtained at 14, 21 and 28 days post-vac - cination follow-up. The infection rates found were very low, with an estimated efcacy of over 95% for overall infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization and death. Butt et al., in the United States, report an incidence of COVID at 3 months, in vaccinated population, of 0.1% compared to 6% in the un - vaccinated population [5]. In Qatar, a study was conducted to determine the severity of disease in vaccinated vs. [5]. Age is the main risk factor for severity which spikes in both groups above the age of 60 years. The concern arises when the incidence is broken down by months post-vaccination. In a study in July mRNA-1273, with BNT162b2,3 and those not vaccinat - ed, with a follow-up of 6 months. With both cohorts there mentalmente, las formas graves de enfermedad. La duraci\u00f3n de esa protecci\u00f3n no se conoce bien, es diferente en distintos individuos y para distintas variantes del virus y no es f\u00e1cil-mente predecible con pruebas de laboratorio. Los datos sobre el impacto real de una dosis complemen - taria o \"booster\" en la literatura cient\u00edca son escasos por el momento y su aplicaci\u00f3n en grandes poblaciones como las del estado de Israel pueden asociarse a una disminuci\u00f3n del riesgo de nuevos episodios y episodios graves en el corto periodo de observaci\u00f3n disponible. Carecemos tambi\u00e9n de datos sucientes sobre la seguri- dad y potenciales efectos adversos de estas dosis complemen - tarias e ignoramos el momento id\u00f3neo de administrarlas en distintas situaciones. En este estado de cosas, parece prudente administrar do - sis complementarias a aquellos expuestos a un mayor riesgo, como pueden ser los individuos inmunodeprimidos y las per - sonas mayores. Por el contrario, consideramos que no es este el momento de acelerar improvisadamente una administraci\u00f3n masiva de una tercera dosis a otros grupos de poblaci\u00f3n menos expuesta y de menor riesgo, sin esperar la adecuada infor-maci\u00f3n cient\u00edca, que sin duda ir\u00e1 llegando paulatinamente. No creemos que esta posici\u00f3n, sea incompatible con las advertencias pr\u00e1cticas y \u00e9ticas que realiza la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud a este respecto. Palabras clave: COVID-19, SARS-CoV2, vacunas, dosis adicionales, tercera dosis, booster mainly in use of a booster ID-19 vaccine for previously vaccinated patients, with criteria that do not always coincide. In this regard, the European Cen - tre for Disease doses and additional doses. The former (booster doses) are those administered to persons with normal immune systems, who have responded adequately to vaccination, to reestablish protection after it has decreased, and the latter (additional doses) refer to those administered to persons with weakened immune systems, who did not respond adequately to vaccination. For the sake of simplicity we will refer to both as complementary doses. Spain, like other countries in its environment and situa - tion, has authorized the use of complementary doses for cer - tain segments of the population. In contrast to this situation is the proposal of the World Health Organization (WHO), which advocates vaccinating mil - lions of people around the world who have not yet had the option of receiving any dose, before proceeding to the massive use of complementary doses in economically more affluent countries. The COVID Scientic Committee of the College Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 be routinely measured. Both can be posi - tive in persons who have been naturally infected, whereas in those who have been vaccinated and have not been infect - ed, only IgG antibodies to the S antigen will be positive [12]. The of - sponse to SARS-CoV-2 is not currently standard practice and is performed in research work or specic series of individuals. However, tests are being introduced that detect IgG against the RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) of the spike and whose result, due to its good correlation, could individuals vaccinat - ed with both doses of Pzer's vaccine and who had IgG-an - ti S antibody data, gap infections occurred more depending on the patient, and no common pattern be observed when comparing the values of both techniques. In be in vaccinated individu-als subsequent infection. cases of reinfection, what has been demonstrated is a rapid reduction in neutralizing anti - body titers prior to reinfection. [16]. Although at present, at least in Spain, a specic type of variant (Delta variant) dominates, in the future it will be im - portant to clarify not only which are the antibody titers that determine the specic level of protection of the individual but also whether these breakthrough infections are more related to the type of variant than to the quality of the previous im - mune response. What is easier to afrm, and on which there is unanimous agreement, risk of reinfection or gap infection and will be to establish priority plans for the administra - tion of additional doses of vaccine or with vaccines directed at new variants. 3.- WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE U.S. FDA AND CDC ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ADDITIONAL AND BOOSTER DOSES OF VACCINE? Following an initial FDA proposal, on September 24, 2021, the Director of the CDC approved and the doses of the Pzer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in persons selected by age, underlying disease or population considered at high risk of ex - posure and infection by COVID-19 due to their professional or institutional activity [17].was a drop in disease prevention, which was 86% with mR - NA-1273 and 76% with BNT162b2. In the analysis performed by months, the gures for disease prevention drop to 76% and 52% respectively, but the effectiveness in reducing hospital is maintained. speculative, authors point that the loss of effectiveness and the difference between vaccines could be related to the different variants, predominantly alpha at the beginning and delta in July. These results are similar to those published in October 2021 in Lancet in which the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine above the 5th month is 53% for delta variant infection and 67% for other variants, but remaining at around 90% for hospitalizations [7]. The loss of effectiveness, especially in the elderly, could be due to the different immune response. In a cohort study com - paring the elderly and health antibodies measured the elderly than in the been out in comparing cohorts duration and protection against reinfection by the delta variant so that those vaccinated and not previously infected have a 5.96-fold increased risk (95% CI, 4.85 of reinfection, compared with the two cohorts previously infected and even greater in the group over 60 years of age [9]. Finally, the results obtained with the application of a complementary dose of vaccine have recently been published, which would increase the effectiveness to 90%, although the results are only at 3 weeks [10]. In summary, with up to 6 months of follow-up after vac - cination, although com continues to be observed, data have emerged that point to loss of vaccine efcacy over time, with some dis - cordance in relation to severity. Although with reservations, due to the scarce evidence available, and the need to repli - cate results, the need for a vaccine booster is being debated, at least in the most vulnerable population. 2.- ARE THERE RELIABLE LABORATORY MARKERS TO DETERMINE THE RISK OF INFECTION OR REINFECTION? At present, there is no agreement on which laboratory markers can ensure or predict the risk that a person who has been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 without having ly had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nor is it possible to risk of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated individuals who have had COVID-19 prior to vacci - nation. In the latter, the immune response is higher since vac - B could generate doses in patients vaccinated against elderly and closed en - vironments (socio-health centers) [18]. Regarding the need for the administration doses of vaccines to fully vacci - nated individuals in the general population, they considered that this was not an urgent decision, as the evidence available at this time regarding \"real world\" vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection shows noted that the priority should be to vaccinate all those have not of ECDC technical port. On October 4, 2021, the EMA's Committee for Medici - for Use following an accelerated evaluation - tering additional doses mRNA vaccines (BioNTech / Pzer) and (Moderna) to ple with severely weakened immune systems at least 28 days after the second dose. The recommendation comes after stud - ies showed that an additional dose of these vaccines increased the ability to produce antibodies the causes COVID-19 in organ transplant patients with (BioNTech at least 6 months after the second dose for persons 18 years of age or older with normal immune systems. The data evaluated show an after the second dose in persons aged 18 to 55 years. b) At the national level, public health agencies in EU states may issue ofcial recommendations on the use of booster doses, taking into account emerging efcacy data and limited safety data. Currently, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use is evaluating data to support a booster dose of Spikevax (Moderna) [20]. 5.- WHAT DOES THE WHO RECOMMEND AT THIS TIME REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATION OF BOOSTER DOSES TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY BEEN VACCINATED? In a press release dated August 10, 2021 [21], WHO stat - ed that \"In the context of current global vaccine supply con - straints, the of not yet received a primary vaccination series. For the time being, the goal remains to increase global vacci -It will be administered to persons who meet the dened recommendations and who have previously received the com - vaccination with Pzer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The additional booster dose will be with the same vaccine and at least 6 months after completion of the primary vaccination. Recommendations administer supplemental doses in the U.S. are as follows: - Persons 65 years of age or older, and/or residents of long-stay facilities. - Persons aged 50-64 underlying medical - ditions. - Persons aged 18-49 years with underlying medical pa risk-benet of receiving the booster dose on an individual basis. - Persons aged 18-64 years with high risk of exposure and transmission of COVID-19, due to work or institutional circum - stances may booster dose in the chosen groups because they were the rst to be vaccinated at the beginning of the vaccination campaigns and can now benet from ad - ditional protection. Given that the Delta strain is still circu-lating in the United States, the booster would help the most vulnerable population by protecting them against severe COV - ID-19 and its complications, which are more frequent in these groups. The CDC is committed to continuing to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines so that new booster recommendations can be added in the coming weeks for other population groups and for those who have previously received the other vaccines. CDC Director Dr. Walensky great challenge of making high-impact decisions when ing very complex situations and sometimes poor-quality data to make very specic recommendations. In a pandemic, the greatest benet is obtained if action is tak - en in anticipation of its evolution despite the uncertainty with which we have to work. These are the rst steps in the indications of the \"booster\", which will be completed in the near future. It is important not to forget and to insist on the need to achieve greater vaccina - tion with complete the popu - lation not yet vaccinated, both in the United States and in the rest of the world. 4.- WHAT IS THE EUROPEAN POSITION, PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE ECDC? The ECDC, bearing mind that the strategy is to prevent severe of COVID19, was in favor of considering the administration of a supple - mental vaccine dose, as an extension of the vaccination series, to persons who may experience a limited response to the pri - mary COVID-19 vaccination series, such as some categories of in patients vaccinated Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al. Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 109recommended in the summer of 2021 the third dose for the population that had had a worse response to the vaccine (im - munosuppressed) and have recently ratied and have pro - posed the extension to other risk groups and even to the gen - eral population from the 6th month after vaccination. There were not enough studies of extra doses when the rst recommendations were made and we still have little ev - idence of increased efcacy in the real world, given the very short time elapsed since the beginning of the administration of \"third doses\" and the obtaining of evolutionary data that can be analyzed beyond the titration of antibodies. It occurs in both the general population the aforementioned immunosuppressed groups. The the potentiating effect of the third dose comes from of solid organ transplants and - The mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 in solid organ transplant half of the patients who did not have them after the second dose. - In some studies the levels achieved would obtained on clinical efcacy of this response. - The existing series do not report cases of COVID-19 after the 3rd dose, but the follow-up is too short to be able verify - who receive a 3rd dose of vaccine, there are no serious adverse side effects. - Objective signs of organ rejection after the 3rd dose have only been reported in one heart transplant recipient, with no organ failure in the follow-up up to the date of publication. - The presence of neutralizing antibodies, even at low doses, after the 2nd dose, predicts an enhanced response after the 3rd dose. - The more immunosuppressive drugs, - cept, decrease the response to the 3rd dose and more in com - bination. - Slightly more than half of solid organ transplanted pa - tients do not seroconvert after the 3rd dose of vaccine. patients. France au- for renal (transplanted or on dialysis), their series were brought forward to add knowledge of the response in this group [37-39] and their conclusions are: - The third dose in renal transplant patients and in dia -nation coverage with the primary series (one or two doses for current vaccines).\" Furthermore, WHO adds that and target-ed to the population groups most in need. The rationale for booster doses should be guided by evidence of decreased vac cine efcacy, in particular decreased protection against disease in the general population or in high-risk populations, or due to a coronavirus variant of concern. To date, evidence remains limited and inconclusive on the widespread need for booster doses following vaccination is to work 11, Katherine of Immunization, Vaccines and Biological Medicines, raties this same position in a statement on the Or - ganization's own website [22]. Finally, Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, during a live question and answer session broadcast on September 22, 2021 on the Organization's social media channels [23] said what WHO is advocating is that booster doses in the general population, who have had broad access to vaccines and have already been vaccinated, are not the best option at this time. However, Ryan indicated that WHO is not against giving a third dose to people who may have signif - icant benet, such as the elderly, the and anyone who needs an immune system booster after a full reg - imen of COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Ryan understands that this is compatible with giving the primary vaccine series to everyone in the world who needs it because there is enough vaccine. 6.- WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDATION AND EXPECTED EFFICACY OF COMPLEMENTARY VACCINE DOSES IN IMMUNOSUPPRESSED PATIENTS? It seems to be demonstrated that, in general, COVID-19 is more severe, more prolonged, with a greater possibility of maintaining a high viral load for a longer period of time and, therefore, with a greater capacity for transmission in the im munocompromised population. [24-28]. Likewise, the humoral response to vaccines and in particular to those available against COVID-19, is lower in immunocom - promised patients, both in primary deciencies and in cer - tain treatment subgroups. [14, 29, 32, 33]. The \"booster\" effect of the antibody level response with the second dose of the vaccine and with vaccination after the infection has passed is also certain. this foreseeable immunogenic potentiation of ad - ditional doses to the standard vaccination, the CDC and then other global health agencies were ahead of the evidence and Booster or additional vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against COVID-19 Garc\u00eda-Botella, 105-114 110patients schedule in the unvaccinated population worldwide, (immunocompromised, homes) but not to the entire population in a comprehensive manner, for which there would not be as much evidence or urgency to do so. Regardless of the relevance of a booster campaign, this situation may generate an ethical de - bate, balancing the national and international responsibilities of the states [47]. The WHO already states that this situation may increase the inequality of access to vaccines in the differ- ent countries of the world, where there are still countries such as the African continent where the complete vaccination is around 3%. Thus, there are cosmopolitan that consider a global strategy to defeat the pandemic (re - duction of transmission and possibility of new variants) to be pragmatic, the reality is that countries have adopted national policy strategies in the absence of a consensus. This national - ism as a strategy would be based on the investment of local resources and public funds in vaccine research and the con- cept of protecting their population as much as the booster dose in certain is an opportunity cost for the poorest countries or wheth - er there are other barriers beyond vaccine shortages to vaccination should be a prior - ity for all states, while seeking to improve the evidence of the effectiveness of a booster dose in certain populations. Perhaps it not a matter of choosing between one op- tion or another, but rather of certain issues such as cold chain, the possibility of heterologous vacci - nation or local production together with compliance with the established distribution agreements through programs such as COVAX, which have not met their expectations at present [48]. The objective would be to reduce inequity in the maintaining the national commitment of the richest countries in the development of vaccines and promot - ing their distribution in an international framework. 9.- WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF VACCINATION AS A COVID-19 PREVENTION TOOL? WILL PERIODIC VACCINATION WITH THE COVID VACCINE BE NECESSARY? The need for repeat supplemental doses of the COVID vac - cine depends on whether the pandemic evolves into an endemic form infection, such as influenza. This is the future scenar - io that is considered most likely, both because of the evolution of previous pandemics and because of the existence of many conditions that make it easier for the virus not to be eradicat- ed. Even with the best progress in vaccination, it seems likely that reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 may remain in both unvaccinated populations and animals, as is the case with other coronaviruses. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 non-seroconverted. - The higher the immunosuppressive the humoral response. dialyzed it immunosuppressants for myeloma or amyloidosis. - There are no adverse side effects. Other cohorts of patients with immunosuppression and booster doses. There are no analyzable series, for the mo - ment, of 3rd dose or additional dose to the standard vaccine in patients under immunosuppressive treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases or other types of oncologic patients (sol - organ or hematologic) already mentioned. Neither in patients under immunotherapy, a group in which the safety of the vaccine was especially valued due to initial suspicions of the possibility of of adverse effects. Only the sum of particular actions in this group are availa - ble without alarm bells ringing in the updated literature [40, 41]. 7.- WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE AND EFFICACY OF BOOSTER DOSES OF NON-mRNA VACCINES? Existing information on the additional doses vaccines other than mRNA vaccines is still very scarce. The available data refer mainly to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Two studies, not yet published, have been carried out with this vaccine. The rst phase 3 study (ENSEMBLE-2) is a dou-ble-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efcacy of a two-dose regimen of the vaccine administered at an interval of 56 days to adults over 18 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19 [42, 43]. After a median follow-up of 36 days, a dose was shown to achieve 100% (CI, 33%-100%) protection against severe/critical COVID-19 at least 14 days after the nal vaccination, 76% (55%-88%) against symptomatic COVID-19 globally, and 94% (58%-100%) against symptomatic COVID-19 in the United States. The sec - ond dose of vaccine was generally well tolerated [44]. In the second study, the second dose was administered 6 months af - ter the rst In case, a 9-fold increase in antibody levels was observed at 1 week after administration and in - creased up to 12-fold at 4 weeks. By comparison, when the second dose was administered two months after had risen 4 to 6-fold [45]. The data are not yet published and approval for the administration of the booster dose of this vaccine has not yet been received. 8.- IS THERE REALLY A CONFLICT IN THE USE OF BOOSTER DOSES OF VACCINES IN HIGHLY DEVELOPED NATIONS VERSUS LESS ONES? In of the dilemma that could arise regarding the administration of a supplementary dose to Booster or vaccination doses in patients vaccinated against Garc\u00eda-Botella, et al. Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 105-114 111We do not believe that this position is incompatible with the practical and ethical warnings issued by the World Health Organization. The arrival of vaccines in the world with a low prevalence of vaccinated people should be compatible with the additional doses needed in countries of the economical - ly richer world. It should not be forgotten that the arrival of vaccines to millions of disadvantaged human beings who have not received them so far depends not only on the will or gen - erosity of the nations that possess them. We are aware that there are political, economic, logistical and technical factors that can make the best will to help and solidarity of some hu - man beings with others fail. CONCLUSIONS 1.- More than six months after the application of the rst vaccines against COVID, a high level of protection is main-tained, against American and European health authori - ties admit, in the absence of very solid data on their efcacy, the administration of complementary doses for the most populations being changing. Third doses currently of being approved populations, including those select-ed on the simple criterion of being over a certain age. 6.- The WHO, while not frankly opposing this trend, points to the need to vaccinate rst those populations of the world that have not yet had access to the vaccine on a mas - sive scale. 7.- There are very few studies adverse effects vaccine large segments of the population, but some health author - ities point to the need to \"go ahead\" of the pandemic and in - crease, accepting the uncertainty, the degree of immunization of the population. 9.- This Scientic Committee of COVID, of ICOMEM, sup ports the of administering a (complemen to until more studies on both the efcacy and safety of this med - ical practice are available. 10.- We consider that getting the necessary vaccines to the world that needs them is not only a decision of solidarity, but that it runs up against logistical and political problems that cannot always be solved purely and several may endemic immunity against the virus and its variants, something we will only know in the long term. If this is the case, the time when epidemic peaks are expected to occur will coincide with the influenza season, as the cold conditions less time outdoors and more personal contact. This makes it possible for both vacci - nation campaigns to coincide [49-51]. 10.- WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE COVID SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE OF ICOMEM ON THE ISSUE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUPPLEMENTARY DOSES OF VACCINES TO THE SPANISH POPULATION? The efcacy of the vaccines administered to date is be - yond doubt and they have managed to reduce, fundamental severe forms of disease, requiring hospital admis and deaths due to COVID-19. However, the vaccines administered to date do not totally prevent the acquisition of viral infection and transmission to third par - ties. The duration of this protection is not well known and it happens to be different in different individuals and for different variants of the virus. In any case, at present, pro - tection cannot be rmly deduced from tests such as antibody titers in patients who have already had a primary episode of COVID, some of them severe and fatal. Data on the real impact of a complementary or \"booster\" dose are scarce in the scientic literature. An additional dose may induce the appearance of antibodies for example in up to 50% of solid organ patients had not responded booster doses in large populations such as those in the state of Israel may be associ-ated with a decreased risk of new and severe episodes in the short observation period available. On the other hand, data on the safety and potential ad - verse effects in vaccinated individuals when exposed to a new dose are limited and even less on the ideal timing of adminis - tration in different situations. In this state of affairs, it seems prudent to administer sup - plementary doses to those exposed to a higher risk, such as immunocompromised individuals and the elderly, particularly among those most at risk because they live in health care fa - cilities. On the contrary, we consider that this is not the time to improvise a massive administration of a third dose to oth - er population groups less exposed and at lower risk, without waiting for adequate scientic information, which will un - doubtedly or additional vaccination doses in patients et al.

El desarrollo vacunal no ha impedido, durante todo el periodo de la pandemia, la b\u00fasqueda constante de remedios terap\u00e9uticos, tanto entre los medicamentos ya existentes y con indicaciones diversas, co - mo en el desarrollo de nuevos f\u00e1rmacos.

The development of vaccines has not prevented, during the whole period of the pandemic, the constant search for therapeutic medicines, both among ex - isting drugs with different indications and in the development of new drugs.

In this rst trial, no clinical benets were obtained, but a trend started results were also found within the study in which 405 hospitals in 30 countries participated. A total of 11,330 patients were included in different groups, of whom to observed in this study [13]. In the multi-center DisCoVeRy study, which included more than patients [14] clear benet was study, even a reduction in all-cause mortality. This trial led to FDA approval of the drug [15]. In showed a improvement and a reduction in the number of days of hospi - talization. The differences in mortality were not signicant, al - though there was a trend in that direction in the 5-day treat - ment studies [5]. In an observational study carried out in Spain at the Hos - pital Cl\u00ednico de Barcelona, the use of remdesivir improved sur-vival, with greater efcacy in patients who received treatment earlier, with a total reduction in the risk of death of 62% [16].

In addition, there is still a large number of unvaccinated persons. In the case of children aged 5 to 11 years, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the Comirnaty vaccine November 2021 [1]. The treatments against the disease are beginning to bear objective and signicant fruit both in the eld of direct antivi - ral therapy and in that of anti-inflammatory and immunother - apeutic treatment. A good example of this is the repositioning of monoclonal antibodies or the presentation of new can be administered orally. The Scientic Committee of COVID-19, of the Illustrious College of Physicians of Madrid (ICOMEM) has received and has been asked several questions about the present reality of the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19, to which the group has tried to give answers, after deliberation and consensus. This document is not intended to be an exhaustive review of the state of the art of pharmacological treatment of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in-cludes the situation in pages we have compiled the scientic ev - also providing the opinion group. SOME CLINICALLY EFFECTIVE ANTIVIRALS AGAINST COVID-19 In a disease of with some very aggressive and rapidly evolving forms, logical with antiviral activity began to be used to a certain extent, indiscriminately, from the onset of the pandemic.

In the trial (BLAZE-1), the mean decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load at day 11, the endpoint, was signicantly greater with bamlanivimab plus etesevimab than with place - bo. Hospitalization for COVID-19 or death from any cause at day 29 occurred signicantly less frequently the group, compared with 10 in the placebo group [59]. In a second trial (BLAZE-4), the FDA selected 700 mg/1400 mg as the licensed dose for use bamlanivimab and etese - vimab together, prompting the manufacturer to this in a new cohort (BLAZE-1.5). The rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 or death from any cause at day 29 was signif - icantly lower with the antibodies than a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and within 10 days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Patients should be treated in management of the infusion. In March the Committee for Medicinal Prod ucts Medicines results of studies with bamlanivimab and etesevimab, for the treatment of conrmed COVID-19. The review ended without issuing the conclusions, once the company Eli Lilly Netherlands BV, the marketer of the two molecules, informed the Agency on October 29, 2021 that it was withdrawing from the process [60]. In its letter notifying the Agency of the withdrawal, the company stated that it was withdrawing because EMA required prospective concurrent validation data that could only be generated through the pro - duction of new batches of active substance and that it was not in a position to generate such additional data. This product has been withdrawn from evaluation process The FDA has cleared this combination of monoclonal an - the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in in-dividuals over 12 years of age and weighing no less than 40 kg who are at high risk for progression to severe enzyme receptor (ACE 2). Interim results from the (Early Treatment of COVID-19 in Outpatients) Phase II clinical were a single intra venous of sotrovimab in 291 adult patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 (Sat O2 94% on room air), not hospitalized, within the rst 5 days of symptom progres - sion versus a placebo group of 292 infected. Patients included in the trial were 18 years of age or older and were at high risk for progression of COVID-19 because of their age ( 55 years) or because they had at least one risk factor severe primary efcacy outcome was hospital - ization (for > 24 hours) for any cause or death within 29 days after randomization. The use of sotrovimab was associated with an 85% reduction in the relative risk of progression to severe or critical illness and up to a 79% reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization or death through day 29. In addition, no safety issues were identied that compromised treatment [52]. In May 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of sotrovimab in the US [53]. In Europe, it is part of the Euro - pean Commission's portfolio of promising treatments against COVID-19 [54]. In May 2021, the Committee Products for its positive opinion on the drug, following review of data from the interim analysis of data from the Phase III Comet-ICE study [55] and will be studied by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible authorization.

The use of corticosteroids lung replication plays an important role in lung damage, in the need for mechan - ical ventilation and, globally, in the survival of patients with COVID-19.

Grade pared to placebo in the risk of hospitalization and/or death among adults with mild-moderate severe disease [73]. 5. THE ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS IN THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE COVID-19 The use of dexamethasone is recommended in critical - ly ill patients with COVID 19 require oxygen therapy or ventilatory support. The recommended dose is 6 mg daily for 10 days or until hospital discharge. Comparison of dexameth - asone 12 mg daily versus 6 mg has shown no difference in the results regarding efcacy (survival without life support at 28 days) and safety in the most critically ill patients [74]. If dexa - methasone is not available, other glucocorticoids at equivalent doses (total daily doses of hydrocortisone 160 mg, methyl - prednisolone 32 mg or prednisone 40 mg) may be considered, although the data supporting the use of these alternatives are more limited than those for dexamethasone [75-77]. In con - trast, the use of dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoids) is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 (patients not receiving oxygen). The World Health Organization (WHO) [77] has established two recommendations regarding the use of corticosteroids COVID-19 patients: 1. Administration of systemic corticosteroids in prefer - ence to no administration for the treatment of and Refraining the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of non-critically ill COVID-19 patients (conditional based on saturation threshold of 90% for the of severe COVID 19 is con - sidered arbitrary and is recommended to be adjusted to the patient's baseline situation. The main study supporting these recommendations is Re - covery [78] which shows a reduction in 28-day mortality in with COVID 41.4%) or oxygen therapy (23.3% - without respiratory support (17.8% vs. 14.0%). The main adverse events related to the use of corticosteroids have the treatment of COVID-19. * There is not enough data to consider its use.Pharmacological treatment of COVID-19: an opinion paper et Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 115-130 121the prole of patients who can benet optimally from each of them remains to be determined. The elevation of some plasma markers may help to make the decision. Elevated IL-6 and CRP have been shown to to identify patients iden - tify from anakinra. It is also not known whether the association of than one these immuno-modulatory drugs adds any advantage to the isolated admin - istration of each of them. The target on which they act is dif - ferent, which could determine synergism with potentiation of the benets. 7. KNOWN is a broad-spectrum antiparasit - ic agent for the treatment of parasitic infections, but not for COVID-19. In particular, the World Health Organization does not recom - mend the use of this drug except in the context of a clinical trial [101] other studies so it was thought that it could be useful in the control of the inflammatory complica - tions of COVID-19. Colchicine is approved in some countries, such as Spain, for the treatment of gout and familial Medi - terranean fever, but not for COVID-19, as it is considered that there is insufcient evidence of its usefulness, and it al - so has signicant adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal. [105,106]. Therefore, it can only be used for the treatment of COVID-19 within a clinical trial. Vitamin D. Vitamin D supplementation has been associat - ed with lower risk data to recommend or reject the use of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 [107]. A Cochrane review found a large heteroge-neity of studies on this vitamin in the treatment of COVID-19, due to the different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D level of the participants and the results found [108]. It is noteworthy that one of the rst clues to the potential usefulness of vitamin D in COVID-19 was a pilot randomized controlled trial conducted in Spain, the [109]. Metformin. Metformin is a rst-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, but it has also shown some efcacy in infectious diseases, such as influenza and hepatitis C. In a July 2021 re - view, 4 observational insufcient to families: encourag - ing, but were not always followed by similar mortality in patients inflammation data (CRP >75 mg/L this study) [89], similar to some observational studies [90,91].

There is no doubt that the group of drugs we are discuss - ing have a role in the treatment of patients with severe COV - ID-19 pneumonia. It should that, in a recent review, baricitinib and tofacitinib were included, along with dexameth - asone and tocilizumab, as the drugs possible that anakinra could be to this list. The timing of administration also seems administered during the early of the disease, when antiviral resolved.

A systematic review and me - ta-analysis evaluating the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in therapies events reported more frequently for lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 84) compared to other and used, are currently discarded for the treatment of COVID, since after large studies with large populations they have not shown benet. 9. PECULIARITIES OF THE USE OF ANTI-COVID DRUGS IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN In the current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, both wom- en of childbearing age and pregnant women are a very large population at risk for SARS-COV-2 infection [122]. of serious and pregnancy, make it to study new drugs in this population group [126-128]. We could summarize the drugs used for COVID in preg- nant women in 3 groups [127] : 1.- Drugs that have not demonstrated efcacy against COVID-19, as listed in another section thalidomide, and level of the renin angiotensin system and affect fetal renal development. 3.- New drugs, immunomodulators, with little knowledge in pregnant women. Among them are: tocilizumab. There is lit - tle experience with the use of tocilizumab in pregnant women with rheumatic disease and experts only it the the potential risks [126]. possibly antiviral effects. On October 27, 2021, the results of the TOGETHER trial, which is the largest randomized trial to date (741 patients on fluvoxamine and 756 on placebo) to evaluate the effectiveness of this drug in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 in Brazil, were published on October 27, 2021 [112]. Compared to those treated with placebo, patients with fluvoxamine (100 mg twice a day for 10 days) reduced by 38% the frequency of hospitalization, de - ned as a stay of more than 6 hours in a COVID-19 emergency device or transfer to a tertiary hospital due to COVID-19. These results are very encouraging because of the high efcacy of the treatment, and because it is oral and very low cost, but they need to be replicated in new studies. 8. DRUGS DISCARDED used have now been shown to be would like to highlight and lopinavir/ritonavir. We will now detail what motivated their use and why they are no longer in use. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are drugs ap - proved for the treatment of lupus erythematosus, rheu - matoid arthritis and malaria. They were among the rst treatments used at the beginning of the pandemic. Hydrox - ychloroquine was thought to be more effective due to the results of in vitro experiments and pharmacokinetic models. However, published studies do not indicate that they have antiviral efcacy, nor do they improve course relative risk from these trials was 1.11, 95% CI 0.99-1.24, with no apparent benet in both ventilated and nonventilated patients. This CI in patients with COVID, especially in moderate-se - vere cases. Its use has also been justied with the intention of reducing bacterial critically ill patients. A meta-analysis of all types of clinical studies (including 17 papers) found no COVID-19 [119]. No statistically signicant - ferences were found in the rate of mortality, mechanical ven - tilation or hospital admission between the control group and the group treated with azithromycin.

CURRENT REGULATORY PATIENTS IN SPAIN Remdesivir is currently the only specic drug against COV - ID-19 approved by the AEMPS. It is indicated used in treatment of COVID-19 and fully available in Spain [144]. The use of immunomodulators has become especially in patients at the phase of the disease. The drugs used are approved for marketing in Spain, but in entities other than COVID-19. The most widely used are for and cytokine re - lease syndrome associated prescribed in our country for off-label indications. The European Med - icines Agency (EMA) concluded that these monoclonal an - tibodies can be treat conrmed in years or older and weighing kg) who do not require supplemental oxygen therapy and who are at risk of to severe COVID-19 [145,146]. The for Ronapreve\u00ae (casirivimab and imdevimab) treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older and weighing least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of worsen - ing their disease, as well as for the prevention of COVID-19 in people aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis). This decision comes one day after the positive opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), demonstrating the priority of the EMA and the European Commission to reduce review times for safe, effective antiviral antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activi - ty, used in the treatment of maternal multiple sclerosis, has been proposed for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 but there are no recommendations for use in COVID-19 in - fected pregnant women. Remdesivir has insufcient experi anti-COVID-19 methyl dexamethasone have in prospective studies and have demonstrated the maternal SARS-COV2 infection [125]. It is essential to need to include pregnant women in clinical trials in order to have data that allow the use of already available and future drugs with safety and cer - tainty of effectiveness, without having to do it in compassion - ate use or by extrapolation of data obtained in other popula - indications [126]. SARS-COV-2 infection in children accounts for 10% ported cases of COVID-19. [129, 130]. Although the majority of infected children do not specic treatment for the virus, it should be remembered that between 4 and 8% may require admission to the ICU [131-138]. Regarding treatment of COVID-19 in children, there are no data from large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, and there are few suf - cient information to dictate treatment recommendations for COVID-19 in the pediatric population. The NIH Clinical Guide - lines for treatment COVID-19 contain specic recommenda-tions and considerations for pediatric [139]. In summary: Remdesivir is FDA cleared for the treatment of COVID-19 in children over 12 years of age, weighing more than 40kg. Also available on an emergency basis FDA (USA) for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized young children weighing between 3.5 kg and 40 kg, or under 12 years of age weighing more than 3.5 kg. [140].

Madrid.Review infection is now almost 40 years old. In this time, along with the catastrophe and tragedy that it has entailed, it has also represented the capacity of modern society to take on a chal - lenge of this magnitude and to transform an almost uniformly lethal disease into a chronic illness, compatible with practi-cally normal personal and relationship life. This anniversary seemed an ideal moment to pause and reflect on the future of HIV infection, the challenges that remain to be addressed and the prospects for the immediate future. This reflection has to go beyond merely technical approaches, by specialized profes- Correspondence: Emilio Bouza MD, Esteban Santiago Beatriz Mothe17 Maria Luisa Podzamczer19 Pulido20 Tom\u00e1s Ramos21 Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos22 In\u00e9s Su\u00e1rez Garc\u00eda23 Esteban Palomo24Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, 2022;35(2): 131-156 132There are probably many milestones in the history of HIV infection since its discovery, but I would highlight the follow - ing 12: 1.On June 5th, 1981, the CDC alerted of the occurrence of 5 cases of Pneumocystis carinii (now P. jirovecii) pneumo- nia in associated with CMV disease or infection and suggesting that it was due to an immunodeciency whose cause was not yet known [1-4]. 2. In 1984, French researchers on the one hand and US re - searchers on the other - with controversy over the claim to rst discovery - isolated a virus they called HTLVIII (US) or LAV (France), later unied as HIV, as the cause the presence of antibodies to the virus through serological tests that were immediately widely used to diagnose HIV in people who had contracted the virus [5-13]. 3.In the 1980s, the knowledge that famous personalities from the world of art and sport (Rock Hudson, Freddy Mer - cury, Magic Johnson, etc.) had been infected with HIV was important in drawing attention to a growing pandemic and demonstrating that it did not only affect marginalised groups in society [14]. 4. In 1987, antiretroviral drug, AZT (azidothymidine or zidovudine), was partially and temporarily trial was only months). AZT had toxicity, but it was the rst thera - peutic step in the ght against HIV [14, 15]. 5. In 1994, study 076 was the rst to demonstrate that ef- fective antiretroviral treatment (ART) was able to prevent vertical HIV in pregnant women . This randomised, double-blind clinical trial infection in newborns of women taking AZT dur - ing pregnancy versus placebo[16]. 6. In 1996, coinciding with the International AIDS Confer - ence in Vancouver, it was shown that a three-drug reg- imen of ART - - 7.That same year, we were able to start assessing the response to ART in our hospital laboratories by measuring plasma viral load, which allowed us to know within a few weeks whether or not the treatment was being effective[18]. In 2005, the rst scientic evidence of the preventive ef- cacy of suppressive ART serodiscordant heterosexual couples was presented [19]. 8. In 2007, the rst triple-ART regimen (TDF/FTC/EFV) was marketed in Spain in a single tablet to be administered once a day [20]. It was the beginning of a phase that was moderna de asumir un reto de esta magnitud y de transformar, gracias al tratamiento antirretroviral, una enfermedad mayor - itariamente letal en una enfermedad cr\u00f3nica, compatible con una vida personal y de relaci\u00f3n pr\u00e1cticamente normales. Este aniversario parec\u00eda un momento id\u00f3neo para pararse a reflex - ionar sobre el futuro de la infecci\u00f3n VIH, los retos que todav\u00eda quedan por abordar y las perspectivas para el inmediato futuro.

While it is one of humanity's greatest tragedies, it is at the same time one of its greatest successes in scientic development and research. What was achieved was 4 decades ago: where a allows, under very tolerable medication, a state almost close to normality. The research effort has been enormous, but the results are extraordinary. On the other hand, the failure to eradicate the disease, the failure to produce a vaccine and the problems of social injustice that still persist around HIV infection still leave room for im - provement. It therefore seems appropriate to undertake a process of re - flection on where we are after almost four decades and where we want to be in the not-too-distant future. This reflection can only be complete if it is carried out from a multidisciplinary per - spective that includes the points of view of the different actors involved in the problem. For this reason, the Health Sciences Foundation convened a large group of people from different backgrounds to try to pro - vide answers to a series of questions that society is asking about the past and future of HIV infection. The questions posed were accepted by the group as relevant and assigned to a speaker who presented his or her point of view and data for discussion with the group. We now turn to the questions, the rationale underpinning the answer and the conclusions on each point. AS WE APPROACH THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE HIV WHAT MAJOR HISTORICAL MILESTONES WOULD YOU HIGHLIGHT? Daniel PodzamczerPast infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al. Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 133antiretroviral treatment (ART). New prevention measures, the efcacy of current ART and the absence of trans-mission in virologically suppressed individuals will help to reduce the of infection, as well as its social stigma, pending a cure. WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE EPIDEMIC IN FIGURES? Bel\u00e9n Alejos According to the latest UNAIDS report, 37.9 million peo - ple were living with HIV infection globally in 2018. Of them, 79% of people living with HIV knew their HIV status (i.e. about 8.1 million people did not know they were living with HIV). In terms of access to antiretroviral treatment, 23.3 million peo - ple had access to antiretroviral therapy, up from 7.7 million in 2010. Consequently, there has been a steady decline from the number of new infections to 1.7 million new HIV infections in 2018 [28]. In the WHO European Region, which includes Europe and Central Asia, 159,420 new diagnoses were recorded in 2017, corresponding to a rate of 20.0 new diagnoses per 100,000 people. As has been observed over the last decade, most of these cases were recorded in the eastern region (82%), fol-lowed by the western region (14%) and the central region (4%). The current HIV epidemic varies greatly by geographical area. Epidemics in the central and eastern regions account for the majority of cases, and the most frequent mode of trans-mission is heterosexual practices followed by injection drug use. In contrast, in the western part of Europe, sex between men was the most common mode of transmission [27]. Overall, the rate of new HIV diagnoses increased by 37% from 2008 to 2017 across the WHO European Region, but there are also different patterns by geographical area. While a 27% decrease in the rate of new diagnoses is observed in the western region, rates continue to increase in the eastern In addition, very high in all regions and more than half of new diag - noses were late presenters (CD4 < 350 cells/\u00b5L). In Spain, it is estimated that there are currently between 140,000 and 170,000 people living with HIV, which represents a prevalence of 0.4%. According to data from the epidemio - logical surveillance report on HIV/AIDS in Spain, 3,381 HIV recorded in giving for reporting [29]. This rate is similar to other countries in the WHO Euro - pean region, but higher than the average for EU and Western European countries. In comparison with the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), we ob - serve in Spain a higher percentage of diagnoses in men (84.6% versus 75.1%) and a lower percentage in people over 50 years of age (14.8% versus 19.3%). The most frequent mode of transmission is men who have sex with men (54.3%), followed by heterosexual (28.2%) and injection time trend the rate of new diagnoses in Spain in followed in the next decade by the marketing of several one-pill-a-day formulations of effective, well-tolerated and a chronic disease a survival similar to the general population in patients who start ART early in the course of infection - and with an excellent quality of life. The rst long-term ART with an INI - Cabotegravir - and an NNRTI - Rilpi - virine which may have benets on adherence, quality of life and stigma for HIV-infected people [22]. 9. In 2009, the rst data were released on the so-called \"Ber- lin patient\", the rst HIV-infected adult to be assumed to have been cleared of the virus - and therefore cured - following a bone marrow transplant for - kaemia refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This transplant was from a donor with the delta 32 mutation of the CCR5 co-receptor of CD4 cells, which has long been known to confer immunity of CD4 cells to HIV, which unable infect them [23]. 10.In 2011, the HPTN052 tion in serodiscordant couples reduced HIV transmission by 96%. These data were key to the widespread recommenda-tion for early initiation of ART regardless of a daily TDF/FTC regimen to patients at high risk of HIV infection due to sexual practic - es. This approval was on several international clinical trials of thousands of participants - men who have sex with men, women and heterosexual men - which showed that such treatment was able to reduce sexually transmitted was The preventive of PrEP, which has been shown to be cost-effective, were seen in the following years in the signicant decrease in the incidence of new HIV infections in cities or countries where its use was authorised [25]. In November 2019, PrEP was approved and included in the National Health System's service portfolio. 12.Data from the PARTNER 1 and 2 studies demonstrating the absence of sexual transmission of HIV from ART-infected individuals with undetectable plasma viral loads were pub - lished in 2016 and 2019 . these Conclusion: After 40 years, HIV infection has changed from being a fatal disease, in the vast majority of cases, to a chronic infection, with an excellent quality of life for people on Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. coverage borne in mind that in countries such as Spain, where access to treatment is universal and the fraction undiagnosed is low, the improvement that incidence would not be as great as in other countries where the prevalence of HIV infection is possible to eradicate HIV?\", the answer from a public health point of view is clearly, no. When we talk about HIV eradication, we can nd a clin - ical concept, which would be the cure of the individual, i.e. the complete eradication of the virus from a patient's body. On the other hand, eradication, as an epidemiological or pub-lic health concept, at the population level, is dened as the complete elimination of the disease-causing agent from the natural environment (not from controlled laboratories). In any case, HIV eradication is not a goal that we can set as achiev - able in a short period of time. In the case of complete cure of the individual, we know that even with the highly effective antiretroviral therapy available to us, and even if the subject has an undetectable viral load, there remains a low level of viral replication and cellular reservoirs that contribute to We can, however, speak of elimination and control in some areas with regard to HIV infection. Disease elimination refers to the complete cessation of the cases in a given geographical area or population subgroup. For HIV infec - tion this has been blood transfusion-associated transmission and mother-to-child transmission[35]. But unlike in the case of elimination, as the causative agent is still present in the natural environment, we must maintain the preventive and intervention measures that led to the elim-ination of the disease. The primary prevention measures that allowed us to reach this level have been HIV testing of all blood donors and mon - itoring of pregnant women - HIV testing during pregnancy, antiretroviral of HIV-infected women and newborns, and formula feeding of newborns. While there may still be cases of vertical transmission of HIV, these cases must be examined to identify where prevention systems and policies have failed to ensure access prevention measures (aimed the onset of infection) that can be taken de - pending on the environment in which these measures that we can apply to reduce sex - ual transmission of the virus and the acquisition of infection through injection drug use reducing the incidence, prevalence or mortality of cases in a the period 2009-2017 is downward, however different pat - terns are observed depending on the mode of transmission. In the groups of injection drug users and heterosexual practices, a steady decline the period for both males and females. Whilst in the group of men who have sex with men a downward trend is observed only from 2015 on - wards, although disaggregated by origin this decrease is only observed Spanish MSM. Although late diagnosis has de - creased slightly since 2009, it is still very high; in 2017 47.8% of HIV diagnoses were made late < 350 cells/\u00b5L). The 90-90-90 targets set by UNAIDS are that by 2020 at least 90% of people living with HIV should be diagnosed; at least 90% of diagnosed people should be on antiretroviral treatment; and at of on antiretroviral treat - ment should have an undetectable this would mean that at least 73% of people living with HIV have an undetectable viral load. Modelling suggests that 2030. Spanish gures on the 90-90-90 strategy have been provided by the HIV and Risk Behaviour Surveillance Unit [31]. Of the 146,500 people living with HIV in Spain, knew diagnosis, 93.4% were receiving and of those on treatment, 90.4% had reached an un - detectable viral load. Although we are above the EU/ EEA aver - age and very close to achieving the targets set by UNAIDS for 2020, there are still approximately 13.7% of people living with HIV in Spain who do not know they have the infection. Conclusion: HIV remains a priority for European Public Health. However, we have effective tools such as universal pre - vention, screening and treatment to address the ght against the HIV epidemic. It is therefore essential that these tools be implemented more widely and adapted to the time and characteristics of the epidemic. IS HIV ERADICATION POSSIBLE? FOR WHAT YEAR? Victoria Hernando In 2014, the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) set the 90-90-90 target for the year 2020, so that 90% of people living with HIV would know their diagno - sis, 90% of them would receive antiretroviral treatment and 90% of people on treatment would have a suppressed viral load, aiming for the end of the AIDS epidemic by 2030 [32]. These targets that allows the HIV epidemic situation in a particular country or geographic area to be assessed. In Spain, in 2016, the percentages of reaching the targets set by UNAIDS [32]. Various infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et Rev 2022;35(2): 131-156 135WHAT IS A PERSON AT RISK? HOW IS IT DEFINED? Jorge del Romero The epidemiology of HIV in the world is highly variable in each geographic region. In Europe, HIV prevalence is 0.4%, while in Africa it is around 4% (WHO, 2018) [44]. According to WHO, the follow- ing are generally populations\" for STIs/HIV: Sex workers and their clients study an STI clinic in Madrid in 2016 [45] concluded that those most at risk of HIV infection were: MSM between 20 and 39 years old, with several previous negative serologies, a history of STIs and multiple sexual partners with whom they had sex without condoms, under 4,529 people seen for rst consultations at the Sandoval Centre in 2018 were among transgender men and women in sex work (MSW, FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) (Figure 1) Conclusion: Particularly at risk of HIV infection are: sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, transgen- der people, prison inmates, young people and adolescents, and people who use drugs for sexual relations (chemsex). The greatest risk is not knowing that you are HIV-positive or, if you do know, not being able to access antiretroviral treatment.given geographical area. The elimination of sexual transmis - sion of HIV, i.e. zero incidence, cannot be considered a realistic goal, as the number of cases through this mode of transmis-sion remains very high. In addition, we can highlight other key aspects of mon- itoring the HIV epidemic that help control infection and im - prove the situation of people living with HIV infection. These would be secondary prevention measures such as early - and rapid access to antiretroviral treatment. Increase the frequency of HIV testing, especially for people at high risk of acquiring HIV infection, such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs [40]. In recent years, HIV testing sites have not only health care settings, but also community settings, and there is a need to promote rapid, safe and condential access, as there is still a high burden of discrimination and stigmatisation of people with HIV infection. According to Public Health England (PHE) ofcials, this has been one of the key points in the decline in the numbers of new HIV diagnoses in recent years in England [41,42]. onset of other co-morbidities associated with both HIV infection and the longer life expectancy of HIV-in - fected people. It also interrupts transmission of the virus, as a person who achieves and maintains an undetectable viral load does not transmit HIV to sexual partners [43]. High adherence to prescribed antiretroviral treatment is eradication of HIV as an achievable goal in the near future, but we can re - duce to zero the incidence of cases in certain modes of transmission and improve control in others, such as sex - ual transmission.

Conclusion: The life of an HIV-positive patient brings with it a daily need to take responsibility and self-manage their health process, and this involves making physical, but al - so SHOULD THE MEDIA PLAY? Alipio Guti\u00e9rrez The rst thing is to observe the maximum scientic rigor. In the same way that medicine is moving towards precision, personalised medicine, we should seek precision journalism. With rigor, with data and scientic evidence. All the more so because now the media, like citizens, also communicate through social networks and there, scientic evidence does not gain value, it is not a plus in any way. Sometimes, on the con - trary, the scientic truth about any health issue, and in this case, about HIV infection, has no relevance because anyone can assert their opinion on whatever they want and even if they do not have the truth, if they have a loyal following on social media, they can make that opinion prevail over the sci - entic reality of the moment. This is why I believe that it is necessary to effectively and health administra - tions in order to know how to \"compete\" in this new commu-nication scenario. Secondly, we must ght the social stigma of those affect - ed by HIV. For this, \"MASS MEDIA\" is the best and most effec - tive tool, together with the school. It has taken decades to put a face to this disease and it is still \"hidden\" today. What is hid-den does not exist and also prevents normalisation. We must commit to the elimination of the social stigma against people affected by HIV that affects their lives. Thirdly, the media should bring back the visibility that this epidemic had when it was deadly. At the time, it was frequent-ly featured in the media. Now that the disease \"does not kill\", and has become chronic, it is no longer news. But this makes it all the more paradoxical. I believe that this is a commitment of ours that is highly topical because we are in the \"time of chronicity\" and it is important that everything related to HIV, from research to the social normalisation of those affected, is WHAT IS LIFE LIKE FOR AN HIV-POSITIVE PATIENT IN PHYSICAL TERMS? Maria Jos\u00e9 Fuster Overall, it can be stated that the clinical situation of peo - ple living with HIV (PLHIV) has evolved positively with the ex - pansion of antiretroviral treatment and there is a continuing there are different - les of PLHIV and different levels of complexity in their health by older PLHIV with co-mor - are not the same as those faced by controlled and stable patients, those who are newly diagnosed, those with problematic substance use, or those who are socially excluded, to give an example of different proles. Therefore, the life of PLHIV in all its facets is not homogeneous but there is a lot of variability. Recent research by the Spanish Interdisciplinary AIDS So - (SEISIDA) measuring quality of large sample of PLHIV in Spain (n=1,441) showed that the overall health per-ception and quality of life score was close to 70 on a scale of 100 (68.5 \u00b1 22.61). proles, such as people over 50, wom - en, or those with a lower socio-educational level[48]. The over - all perception of health is influenced by many factors, one of them being the symptoms experienced on a daily basis. A study of a cohort of HIV-positive veterans in the United States showed that several of the symptoms they experienced pre SEISIDA studies [51,52] show da - ta line with these ndings, as the most prevalent symptoms in PLHIV in Spain are the same, and the most bothersome are sleep and sexual problems. The general health and symptoms experienced by PLHIV relate to many aspects of the process of living with HIV; the experiences, thoughts and emotions in - volved. A qualitative study that SEISIDA and the Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) are conducting to improve the quality of life of shows, other that sleep prob related social and stigma. the distress caused by the worries and fears that PLHIV have to cope with on a daily basis, such as uncertainty about the future or fear of rejection. These or other symptoms are also related the causes determine various symptoms and them, the intervention and self-management of the symp - tom will be different. So where should we start? It is essen - tial to detect these problems in order to be able to intervene and respond to them. Studies show a very high discrepancy between the symptoms reported by patients and what their SEISIDA and IS-Global qualitative study explored the reasons for the lack of Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. 2022;35(2): 131-156 13750 copies/ml close to delivery; there was not a single transmis - sion to the newborn (95% CI): 0.1%) [57]. In low-income also drastically continuous ART with antiretrovirals hav - ing doubled in the last decade to 92%, and the number of new infections in children having fallen by more than 70%, there were still 160,000 new infections in children by VT in 2018 [28]. The goal VT elimination requires more than availability, efcacy and safety of antiretrovirals for universal lifelong treatment in women. A comprehensive approach is needed, including reducing new infections in women of child-bearing age and a sequence of maternal and newborn inter - ventions, the removal of which at any point can lead to re - duced effectiveness in preventing VT. control antenatal care, in pregnancy, post-exposure prophylaxis for newborns, and retention in the health system. It is precisely the most vulnerable populations that have the greatest difculty in complying with all the Available at:s in the epidemiological chain, and in whom most higher-risk groups include who are childbirth, drug users or the are themselves infected by VT, in whom adherence is a challenge and selection of resistant virus more prevalent. On the other hand, although current ART is very effective and integrase inhibitors allow for a more rapid decline in viral load during pregnancy, they are not without toxicity. Current WHO guidelines recommend dolutegravir-based regimens, which may the newborn and thus dene the most appropriate treatment regimen in each risk situation. Even with today's great advances, there are still high-risk cases of vertical transmission where, although it is too late to take preventive measures during pregnancy, it is still possible to intervene at birth in the newborn with immediate com - bined prophylaxis. Even when there has been intrauterine in - fection detected by diagnosis in the rst 48h, immediate ART the newborn could allow us to prevent the spread of the vi - rus, reduce the viral reservoir as much as possible, and perhaps a potential eradication. Conclusion: Elimination of vertical of in - come countries is feasible. To achieve this, prevention of once again reflected in the different media as a reflection of what is happening in society. Finally, I am going to say something which, being a jour - nalist myself, may come as a shock: we have to stop being ob - jective about health issues in general. We must be belligerent with scientic evidence, with scientic rigor and eliminate this perverse practice of journalism that, in my opinion, is not sustainable in terms of health. Some media treat health issues any on EQUIDIS - TANCE, offering the same time, the same space in a newspa-per, TV or radio programme to those who hold one opinion and those who oppose it. This is NOT VALID in health. It is as if, by virtue of this objectivity/equidistance, we were to propose, for example, offering the same time and space in the media to those who defend the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and those who violate them. With health issues, and HIV being a clear example, we have to be belligerent and always take the side of scientic evidence. Conclusion: In its relation to HIV topical, scientic stigma of those affected and contribute to the physical and psychological well-being of those affected. HAVE WE ENDED VERTICAL TRANSMISSION? Jose Tom\u00e1s Ramos Vertical transmission (VT) is the predominant mode of HIV-1 transmission in children and is the route of infection for the vast majority of new infections In natural his - VT ranges from 15-25% in the absence of 40% in where breastfeeding trial, in which zidovudine was administered in pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate, documenting 67% of antiretrovi - ral VT, enormous advances the prevention of VT [16]. Viral load in pregnancy is the most important independent factor associated with VT. In developed countries, the Prospective follow-up of pregnant women with HIV and their children has been carried out since 2000 in 9 public hospitals in the Community of Madrid, with data from 1,475 mother-child pairs up occurred, there were missed op - portunities to avoid it When is initiated conception and undetectable viral load is maintained until delivery, vertical transmission may be eliminated, as demon - strated by a study in France in which of 2,651 mothers who initiated ART before conception and remained with viral load < Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. 2022;35(2): 131-156 138In terms of associated comorbidities, we now know the importance of early treatment, which has been shown to pre- vent multi-organ damage from the rst months of infection, as well as irreparable damage to the nervous system in chil - dren. HIV-infected children who are now young adults received cART after the rst few years of life and thus neurocognitive impairment has been observed, but with good performance in daily life. Some neuroimaging studies have shown to cardiovascular risk [62]. comorbidity studied in a series of 98 adolescents aged 16 showed 15% with of patients, been treated with direct-acting drugs, with a cure rate of close 100%, reproductive health, in the transition cohort have had a signicant number of pregnan - cies, more than 60. In a study of 28 pregnant women, nine of them (32%) were at high risk of perinatal transmission because of a detectable viral load close to delivery. In this series, there was no transmission of HIV infection in the second generation thanks to the implementation of retention in care of lower scores on the physical health subscale than non-HIV (P = 0.001) and the general Spanish population (P = 0.006). HIV+ patients had lower scores on the mental than the general Spanish youth population studies and worse (P = 0.002) [66]. Conclusion: Children born with HIV who are now adolescents and young adults are mostly in a controlled HIV status and need to be kept engaged with the health system and cART. The accumulated experience can help the new gen - erations. WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC COST OF HIV IN SPAIN AT THE MOMENT? Jos\u00e9 Manuel Mart\u00ednez Sesmero The benecial effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on HIV HIV infection in women of childbearing age and early di - agnosis to enable early and safe antiretroviral treatment for all infected women is essential. WHAT HAPPENED TO CHILDREN BORN WITH HIV? Marisa Navarro HIV infection in paediatrics has undergone a huge change thanks of therapy perinatal transmission while controlling viral replication in infected children. In Spain, since 2008 there has been a follow-up cohort of HIV-positive children and adolescents from the Network (CoRISpe), includes patients in Paediat - ric Units (PU) since 1995. CoRISpe is in turn linked to the HIV Biobank of the AIDS Research Network, and is allowing us to learn about the evolution of paediatric infection in our coun - try. In CoRISpe, 1,344 patients are registered. Most of them were born before universal HIV screening in pregnant women, with 10% of patients in the cohort dying, mostly prior to cART. CoRISpe is a cohort of mainly adolescent and young adult patients who survived the early years of the epidemic before cART became available, with chil - born in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South Amer - ica, with new HIV infections in children born in Spain being anecdotal. At the end of 2017, 403 young adults with vertical trans - mission are being treated in the AUs. These patients have a median age of 25 (ICER 23.6-25.8) and have been followed up in UA after transition for 7.5 years (ICER 5.1-10.5). Of them, 95% were born in Spain and 56.7% are women. Clinical stage is 29.6% A, 40.4% B, 30% C. Some are receiving cART, with 76% receiving once-daily (OD) regimens HIV viral [58]. Immune status is good, with 33% [59]. Analysing the accumulated resistance of patients transferred compared to immune status, 74% have >500 TCD4 cells/mm 3. Only 65% are found with suppressed viral load, reflecting the difculties in treating these patients with extensive experience with families of drugs, at complex ages (late and taking [60]. after transition, some patients have poor adherence to the health care system with failure to take ART, which in some circumstances leads to disease pro - gression and in some cases (2% of the transition cohort) death [58].Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al. Rev Esp 2022;35(2): 139mortality where they some generic antiretroviral (ARV) drugs have begun to In a context of limited resources for health care, the use of generics would enable a reduction in the cost of ART. In the European Union, it is acceptable for a drug to be replaced by its generic equivalent if the generic equivalent has the same composition and pharmaceutical form as the original drug and has original drug xed-dose co-formulation (FDC) or a complete single-tablet regimen (STR) for its separate com - ponents (de-simplication or breaking of combos). The break-down of complete single-tablet regimens is the main argument against the use of generic ARVs in clinical practice. of generic drugs in our country is TDF/FTC/EFV; the other ART making it possible to allocate these were generic generic lamivudine health [86]. the other hand, criticisms of these changes are based on the fact that lead to a better quality of life for patients, and the reduced potential for resistance development by reducing the risk the non-adherence to single drugs (selective non-adherence) has been adherence[88-90] and a lower risk of this regard, a recent meta-analysis were associated with response and lower cost than multi-drug there cited to the greater effectiveness of STRs versus multiple daily tablets have been conducted the context of - paring STRs with other antiretroviral treatments that do not have the same composition or are even from different families (e.g. comparing an integrase inhibitor-based STR with is undoubted. However, high resource-constrained environment to CD4 CD4s increase above 100 cells/microlitre[31,48,51,66-72]. There are 146,000 people living with HIV in our country [21,72,73] who will require lifelong treatment. The total cost of ART has risen steadily since the inception of highly active ART, with the annual cost of ART being[30] 734,367,344 euros, and it has been estimated that ART accounts for 73% of the total lifetime health care costs of HIV patients in the US[74] and 87% in the rst year in Spain [75]. The cost classication orders previously as health costs), costs for and his/her family (most of the non-health costs: transport, etc.), and costs for other sectors (non-health costs borne by other public entities or such as productivity costs), indirect costs [76]. signi - cantly depending on the drugs chosen in the treatment regimen. The average annual cost per HIV patient has fallen considerably in recent years as a drug patent with virological suppression. Adherence to ART is one of the key determinants of its effectiveness [79] and is of crucial importance given that treatment must be maintained throughout the patient's life. In the wake of the last economic crisis, several regional health administrations and hospitals have imposed measures to reduce the cost of ART, such as setting an annual cost limit per patient or restricting access to some antiretrovirals. These measures have been applied differently in different autono-mous communities in Spain and in some hospitals, producing inequities in access to different ART and being signicantly as - sociated with the use of ART drugs, but cost less the pat - ent on the original branded drugs has expired[80]. These drugs have proven to be effective and have reduced morbidity and Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, et al.

Current cART aims for undetectability of VC, so in most cases VCs and LTNPs with detectable VC have ended up on cART. In relation to ECs, it was observed that it is a heteroge-neous phenotype, with [101]. These ndings, together with others in which ECs have been found to have a higher rate of as a model of persistent viro - logical remission in the absence of cART or \"functional cure\". However, these ndings are controversial, as in another the same authors did not observe such differences [103]. Nor have other large cohorts of controllers a higher prev-alence of other non-AIDS events compared to non-controllers [104]. The key to this controversy is the heterogeneity of the controlling phenotype. ECs can be classied into transient controllers (TC), which are those that eventually lose control of the VC, and persistent controllers (PC), which are those two phe - notypes is important for two reasons: 1) it allows us to design treatment strategies for TCs as they eventually progress, 2) it allows us to recognise PC as the true model of functional cure. In fact, different studies have shown that PCs have higher lev - els of HIV-specic T-response [105], associated with lower viral variability and diversity, along with lower levels of viral reser-voir [105,107], and in turn, have lower levels of inflammation [105]. Additionally, it has been shown that these two pheno - types also differ in a peculiar proteomic prole associated with less inflammation in PCs compared to TCs, as well differ-ent metabolomic and lipidomic prole [71]. These results seg - regate PCs as the true model of persistent virological remission and, on the other hand, differentiate them subjects who will lose spontaneous control and therefore - who should be offered treatment. These ndings shed controversy be treated cART in controllers has been ated with a subjects the subjects included in these studies were VC with detectable viral load. According to the results discussed above, in the case of a subject who has been infected for more than 30 CD4+ cell counts above 500 the benet this scenario would be more than doubtful, contrary to few studies that have compared the efcacy of STR treatment administration components generic equivalents) STR de-simplication breakage strategies have been published. Six them of the brand-name Triumeq \u00ae [97] with their separate components, and all found similar effectiveness. In addition, another study evaluated Triumeq\u00ae de-simplication in cohort of patients no virological failures at 48 weeks [98]. Although there is no conclusive evidence to show that de-simplication of STRs is associated with reduced treatment effectiveness, guidelines the use of [83, and are not from STRs to their generic components separately: in a study in Spain, only 4.1% of physicians said they would never prescribe generic ARVs, 53.3% not do if it meant increasing the number of daily pills. tion, it would in the treatment of HIV infection and their use could lead to signicant cost savings for the National Health System. Their use would imply switching from STRs to the ad - ministration of their components separately (de-simpli-cation or breaking of combos), a strategy that is still controversial, which has led to a lack of widespread use of generic ARVs in our country. However, number of observational studies have shown similar effectiveness of the use of STRs with respect to their separate compo - nents. It would be desirable physicians, pa - tients, and WHAT IS REALITY OF \"SLOW PROGRESSOR\" PATIENTS? Ezequiel Ruiz-Mateos Long-term non-progressors are patients who are at one end of the spectrum of HIV infection progression. When we talk about progression, counts comparable the non-HIV-infected pop - ulation low or undetectable viral loads (VL) in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (cART). This has led to these subjects being considered as a model for the development of immuno-therapeutic and vaccine strategies. Traditionally, these individuals have been for more than Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 141providing antiretroviral treatment to all people living with HIV may be unsustainable in the long term. As the mortality rate among people living with HIV, due to the widespread use of treatment, declines faster than the number of new HIV in - fections, the prevalence of people living with HIV has grown signicantly worldwide. In addition, the increasing number of people suffering at an older age (>60 years) is associated with a number of new challenges, both clinical and immunological. In the absence of an effective prophylactic HIV vaccine, as well as the challenge of treating more than 38 million people with sustained antiretroviral therapy, it is clear that new therapeu - tic strategies will be required for effective viral control, pre - vention or a potential cure. Therefore, there remains a critical medical need for research into new strategies to combat HIV, including the urgency of identifying an effective therapeutic intervention to control the virus in the absence of antiretrovi - ral treatment and ultimately cure HIV [110]. In this context, multiple medical strategies are being ex - plored to eradicate the replication-competent HIV reservoir (\"cure\") or to control viral rebound in the absence of treatment without HIV virological remission\"). In recent years, we have learned viral reservoir is established soon after viral infection. However, and latent viruses that comprise the main viral reservoir in jects on antiretroviral treatment (\"Shock & Kill\" strategy). However, it to a balance between their specic efcacy in to the rst, and until recently only, case of complete eradication that prevents HIV infection of the grafted cells[23]. In early 2019, a second case of HIV remission was announced in a person who has been off antiviral treatment since September 2017, as part of the IciStem project [112] multi-centre study to guide and investigate the potential for HIV cure in infect - ed haematological malignancies and limited to a small group of HIV-infected individuals. The challenge is to adapt or nd viral remission strategies in the absence of antiretroviral treatment that can reach as many people with HIV infection as possible.Therefore, these data support PC as the correct model of functional cure to look to when trying to develop immuno - therapeutic strategies. It is worth that recent studies, 50% of the PCs failed to amplify the virus, and in those that did, the variability and diversity of the virus was very low [105]. Dating studies suggest that the evolution of the virus was stalled at a point very close to infection [105]. These ndings suggest that perhaps some individuals managed to control the virus from the beginning and to some extent persistently stopped its replication, so that these subjects could be con-sidered \"functionally cured\" or even some of them may have achieved a \"sterilising cure\", i.e. they managed to eradicate the virus. Regardless of whether this is the case, this small group of subjects with a persistent LTNP-EC prole constitute a true model of functional cure. analysis of virolog - ical, with persistent immunovirological control can model of functional cure or sustained virological remission. WHAT IS AN HIV CURE AND HOW IS IT DOCUMENTED? Javier Mart\u00ednez Picado Combination antiretroviral therapy is the current stand - ard of care for HIV infection. When used daily, antiretroviral therapy effectively AIDS, increases life expectancy and reduces the risk of transmission. In 2019, approximately 26 million people had access to antiretroviral therapy, representing of However, current antiretroviral treatment is not due to viral persistence in cellular and anatomical reservoirs that escape quently, interruption treatment.

Finally, the of in populations at high risk acquiring HIV, terms sample size, implementation and issues, of a therapeutic vaccine aims to achieve control or complete eradication of HIV from the body without the need for ART. This objective must be achieved through a strategy that is equal to (or better than) the ART, both in terms of cost and accessibility, but above all in terms of security, which sets the bar for non-inferiority very high. One of the main obstacles to the development of a thera- peutic vaccine is also the viral diversity, in addition to the viral subtypes, some of the variability is due to immunological ad - aptation. HIV mutates and escapes relatively fore be effective in different locations with different circulat clinical phases of development. Another major obstacle in the eld of HIV cure lies in the relative degree of immunodeciency of people with HIV in - of This is why we often see early clinical trials of new vaccine candidates in groups of patients treated in the earliest stages of HIV in - fection, whose levels of viral escape and immune depletion are than after years of chronic infection.

Finally, the viral reservoir - made up of latently HIV-in - fected cells that are relatively invisible to the immune sys-tem - is a major source of viral rebound once ART is stopped. Conclusion: There is an urgent to design and in - novative strategies based on new mechanisms to cure HIV infection by ending viral persistence. The aim is to improve the quality of life of HIV-infected people by reducing dependence on antiviral drugs, treatment bur of antiretrovirals as PrEP, and the efcacy of current ART and its excellent tolerability prole, an estimated 1.7 million people acquired HIV in 2018 and still one third of the 38 mil - lion people living with HIV had not accessed ART according to UNAIDS. This is why the development of preventive and thera - peutic vaccines for HIV remains one of the most urgent scien - tic challenges of our time [113]. One of the main difculties for vaccine development lies in the great diversity of HIV globally. Subtype C infections ac - counted for 50% of infections in 2004. Subtypes A, B, D and G accounted for 12%, 10%, 3% and 6%, respectively; and re - combinant subtypes 18%. The fact that different HIV subtypes can differ from each other by more than 30% in their viral genome makes the development of a universal vaccine very complex [114]. Still, in recent years, major advances have been made in the isolation and characterisation of monoclonal antibod - ies derived from B cells people with chronic HIV infection against relatively conserved the V3 glycan, the interface region gp120 or the membrane proximal region of gp41, among others. The use of - gle culture methods, envelope antigens have been key to the isolation and generation of new bNAbs [115]. While progress is being made in understanding how can be induced passive bNAbs alone or protec - tion, which is associated with the levels 2021, that of infection of those strains sensitive to CRV01.

Recall that, according to the World Health Organisation, sexual health is not only the absence of disease but also a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. And PrEP shows that users can have a more pleas - urable sex life. But there are still that should be used \"open the door to promiscuity\" and condom use will be abandoned, with all its consequences. It is true that there is concern about a possible increase in the in - cidence of other STIs to so-called condoms, increased number of sexual partners, etc.). In this regard, it should be noted that while most increase in STIs is observed. In any case, we must bear in mind that this increase has been registered in Spain and other countries for years before the implementation of PrEP, so this increase in STIs cannot be to PrEP, or at least not in its entirety. There are other factors that may influence this increase. What needs to be is potential increase. early detection and treat - many of which are asymptomatic, thus helping to break the chain of transmission. In this regard, some studies show through modelling that regular screening can reduce the incidence of STIs. We also know that the presence of STIs in - creases the risk of HIV infection, which further supports the for such screening. It should be emphasised that PrEP is not only about ad - ministering the drug, but also includes follow-up of users, which is an excellent opportunity to maintain contact with health services, allowing for STI screening, counselling and sexual health education, detection of other health problems, drug use. PrEP is therefore not synonymous with abandoning con - dom use, which must continue to play an important role, but is a powerful preventive tool as part of a broader, holistic pre - vention strategy. At this early stage of the implementation of PrEP in our National Health System, it is essential to promote and facilitate access to PrEP for all those at risk of HIV infec - tion. This requires providing but also awareness raising and training health professionals on PrEP. The challenge is to implement and reinforce all proven effective preventive strategies. If we dramatical - ly reduce HIV infections, as is already nor HIV can be achieved without eliminating or achieving very low levels of induce make the development of effective may have high protective efcacy. HOW FAR SHOULD WE GO WITH RISK BEHAVIOUR PROPHYLAXIS? Pep Coll We now have proven prevention tools that we must use if we are serious about ending the HIV epidemic. A very impor - tant and relatively new is changing the prevention paradigm is PrEP. Until just over 7 years ago, the main preventive tool avail - able was the condom, which has prevented countless HIV in-fections, but has not stopped the flow of new infections. We now know that the combination of disoproxil, fumarate and emtricitabine) can prevent infection in people exposed to HIV, with close to 100% effec - tiveness, provided there is correct adherence to the medica - tion. This is the so-called oral PrEP, which has been approved in the National Health System and which was the great unre - solved issue in our system. Such is the evidence available on the efcacy of PrEP that its recommendation [123] is included in most clinical guidelines: the rst was published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014. In 2015, the World Health Organisation stated that PrEP should be of - fered to all populations at higher risk of HIV infection. It points out that PrEP should be a prevention option in addition risk of infection [125]. The Spanish Bioethics Committee has of the introduction of PrEP[126] , stating that it is ethical to fund it. The Committee sees this as a case similar to others, such as tobacco, noting that \"at no point in the tobacco con - trol debate was there the option of limiting or excluding ac - cess to health care for those who had irresponsibly put their health at risk by smoking\". This means that we cannot deny a person access a powerful preventive tool he or she engages in risky behaviours, or rather what we label as such, with all the stigmatising burden that this can entail. It is important to note that people who seek PrEP do so Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. inhibitors THERAPY: COULD IT G\u00f3rgolas therapy is now, fortunately, a re - ality. Long-acting parenteral treatment is available with great success for some chronic diseases, such as schizophrenia, or as a method of contraception. There are many reasons that support its suitability for the treatment of chronic infection in people living with HIV. On the basis that the patient should not be injection-phobic, parenteral treatment has, \"a priori\", a large number of advantages over oral treatment. Firstly, it can be expected to facilitate good adherence or compliance, as it is, in a way, a form of directly observed treatment adminis - take allows the patient to \"forget\" about the infection and live a completely normal life. Thirdly, it is more than likely to lead to a reduction of the stigma that, unfor - tunately, still exists for many patients who can sometimes be challenged by the simple fact of having to take daily medica - tion. Currently, the most advanced development consists of a parenteral treatment based on the administration of two drugs, cabotegravir to be co-administered to achieve high antiviral potency, slow release and low metabol - ic clearance, allowing for administration every 2 months. This type of treatment is called CARLA, an acronym for Cabotegra-vir + Rilpivirine + Long + Acting. The rst study of this combination, the LATTE-2 trial ex - plored the safety and efcacy of the combination as a main - tenance treatment, well received 20-week induction treatment with oral CAB+ABC/3T. Those who achieved an HIV-1 viral load <50 cop/mL were randomised to one arm of parenteral treatment every 4 weeks, another arm every 8 weeks and another arm continued with oral treatment. The conclusion was that CAR-LA demonstrated its ability to maintain undetectable viral load when every 4 or 8 weeks [22]. Subsequently, a phase III trial (Flair received 20 weeks followed by cabotegravir and oral rilpivirine for 4 weeks, before switching to parenteral treatment. Those pa - tients who agreed to participate in the study were randomised to receive either CARLA every 4 weeks or continue with oral DTG/ABA/3TC. The efcacy of CARLA was similar to conven - tional oral treatment and local tolerance of the injections was good, being better tolerated in administra are not a reason not to recommend it, but to look for strategies to counteract this potential ef - fect. COULD YOU SUMMARIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE MAJOR GROUPS OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS? Esteban Mart\u00ednez There are four major groups of antiviral agents that have been used in the treatment of HIV infection: nucleoside an - (NAs), protease - logues (NANs) and integrase of have played a very important role throughout history [83]. ANs were the beginning of treatment for HIV infection. They were rst used as monotherapy, then in dual therapy and even triple However, suppression of viral replication was suboptimal and clinical limited. Toxicity had a common mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction with vast of antiretroviral regimens have included ANs are components of standard antiretroviral treatment. PIs changed the natural history of HIV infection. Its phar - macokinetics were improved by later allowed to have a high genetic barrier that resistance mutations were not generated, but gave them a higher risk of interactions. The toxicity of PIs has generally been digestive and metabol - ic. Because of their potency and genetic barrier, PIs were the forerunners of the less-than-three-drug regimen. NANs have had better tolerability less risk of inter- actions than PIs. In addition, they have a long half-life, which makes them easy to dose. Unlike other groups, the drugs in the NAN group have generally been able to be taken once a day. In addition, their prolonged half-life has meant that suppression of viral replication can be better maintained with PIs in cases occasional suboptimal adherence. Therefore, PIs have been used preferentially in rst lines of treatment for many years. However, their low genetic barrier is responsible for the emergence of resistance mutations viral replication is not suppressed. Familial toxicity is hypersensitivity and, in the case of neuropsychological appear late antiretroviral genetic barrier. Non-nucleoside analogue drugs half-life and dosing. Finally, in -Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Bouza, more than 180 days, which could be administered once a year via an implant, is under study. This molecule maintains its 10 mg dose achieves an average reduction in HIV-1 viral load of 1.6 log in 7 to 10 days [134]. The main challenge for these drugs is to properly assess with which other drugs they be combined in order to obtain a truly effective ART that can be administered once or twice a year. In this sense, the pharmaceutical industries have a double challenge: on the one hand, to develop the molecule and, on the other hand, to reach agreements with other com - could be another parenteral treatment preliminary studies of which have already begun [135]. Conclusion: Parenteral treatment of HIV infection is a reality that will soon materialise. Its efcacy is similar to conven - treatment and allows patients to receive the medication every 8 weeks. The combination of cabotegra - vir and rilpivirine is the most developed so far, but other promising molecules are in development. REDUCED DRUG SCHEDULES? Federico Pulido Since 1996, antiretroviral treatment has consisted of a combination of three drugs. The reason for this number was due to the need to achieve sufcient efcacy to suppress vi - dramatic the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. With the drugs available at the time, this could only be achieved by combining three drugs, although it is true equally effec - - ducing the number of drugs as long as it does not lead to a loss of efcacy was motivated by of reducing toxicities (those derived from the drug that is no longer used) and reducing the cost of treatment [136]. Attempts to use a single potent to efcacy with the same drugs in triple com - for maintenance of virological suppression. However, suppression was patients and who agreed to participate in the study and received CARLA preferred the intramuscular regimen to the oral regimen they had taken during induction. Only three patients in the CARLA arm had conrmed virological failure with development of re - sistance mutations against NNRTI and INSTI. All three patients had same a treated population. The impact of these ndings is being in - vestigated, but does not seem likely to change the good results obtained. Two similar studies, but with previously treated undetectable viral load Trial Atlas on PIs, NNRTIs or integrase inhibitors. Similarly, the satisfaction of patients treated with CARLA is very high. The frequency of discomfort at the drug injection site was high in the rst few injections, but as in previous tri - als, tolerance improved over the course of the study. Again, the number of conrmed virological failures in the CARLA group was very low (1%), so that only three patients had RPV-resist - ant mutations, some of which were achieved from the start of treatment [128,129]. The Atlas and Flair studies on CARLA have been able to demonstrate that patient adherence has been very high, with up to 98% of injections being administered within the sched window. addition, none of the patients who re - ceived treatment beyond 7 days had virological failure. Finally, the possibility of a transitional oral treatment was also ex - plored, in case the patient could not receive the intramuscular and been satisfactory [130]. In addition, the stigma experienced by people living with HIV may be al - leviated by the possibility of switching from oral to injectable treatment, particularly when administered as a long-acting treatment such as CARLA [131]. But progress does not stop there, that is only the begin - ning. Ideally, a treatment should be available that can be ad-ministered, or better, self-administered parenterally, e.g. sub - cutaneously, or via a slow-release reservoir, every three, six or even twelve months. There are three molecules at different stages of development that could be used in this way. A po-tent capsid inhibitor (GS-6207) with a half-life of more than 24 weeks and activity against virus resistant to other antiret - roviral families, which could be administered subcutaneously. This new drug in development has many advantages. Firstly, it has a novel mechanism targets resistant to them; and nally, due to its long half-life it would allow administration possibly every 6 months. Results single ad 1.8-2.2 log10 reduction in viral load over 10 days. In addition, the drug was safe, with few mild side effects at the site, candidate for further clinical development [132, 133].Past and infection. A document based on expert opinion E.

The enormous efforts of scientists in HIV vaccine develop ment and eradication of HIV infection make close between HIV clinicians and basic science researchers essential. Specialists in HIV with other health and community agents continue to work tire - lessly to achieve zero new HIV infections in Spain, to eliminate the stigma associated with HIV infection and to achieve the not impossible, but still distant, of HIV Conclusion: Specialised HIV units will continue to be indispensa - ble in the coming years. However, there will be a shift from the current, exhausted, acute patient-centred model to a more efcient model patient care. Experts should continue to contribute to maintaining the high standards in HIV research. WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES? Santiago Moreno The treatment currently prescribed for people with HIV infection is close to optimal, both in absolute terms and rela - tive to treatment chronic diseases. HIV infection is among the diseases for available the rate of therapeutic efcacy and the least toxic effects and the greatest impact on the health status of the recipient. Antiretroviral treatment has not only enabled people with HIV infection to have a life expectancy similar to that of the non-HIV-infected population, but to do so with a good quality of life without limitations that might result from the disease itself or from the medication. In the current situation, it is difcult to improve the treat weeks or will certainly be an improvement, but not a dra-matic change. Improving antiretroviral treatment is not really the most important issue at hand, nor is it the most pressing. The most immediate ambition is to achieve a cure for those infected and, even more ambitiously, the availability of a vac - cine whose administration to those at risk would prevent infected. These are clearly two issues in the ght against HIV in industrialised countries and globally. Their achievement is not on the near horizon and we are therefore faced with more immediate problems still be considered a very impor- tant tool for the control of HIV infection. New advanc - es in neutralising antibody therapy and its application to vaccine development although some issues related to stability and efcacy still need to be ad - dressed. On the other hand, immune-enhancing drugs such as immune checkpoint inhibitors could make reser-voir cells visible to the immune system and enhance the antiviral effect of functional cure of HIV by exerting better control of the reservoir. WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF HIV SPECIALISTS? Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Bernardino With the full implementation of - As has already been demonstrated in other cities such as London, Paris and San Francisco, HIV specialists in HIV units must take the lead in these initiatives together with other health stakeholders and public health ofcials. An inescapa - ble and achievable goal is to reach zero new HIV infections in Spain. With the decline in new HIV infections, the need for spe - cialised HIV units may be questioned. The stigma associated with the infection, unfortunately still very present in our so - ciety, together with the general lack of knowledge about HIV infection, even among health professionals, exclusion who are often excluded from the health system and who re - ceive social and health care maintenance of these centres is essential for the social and health care of these groups. At present, the life expectancy of HIV-infected people is similar to that of the general population, so the number of people with HIV infection being followed up in the units will be increasing and this translates into a change in care needs. Growing older with HIV infection, the comorbidities associated with this process, and in short, the chronicity of the different pathologies that can converge in a person with HIV infection, requires a multidisciplinary approach that must coordinated by HIV infection specialist. This new landscape is a unique opportunity to lead the transformation of the healthcare sys - tem from an outdated and hugely expensive acute care model to a more modern day chronic care model. In these models it is essential to place the patient at the centre of care. A model in which the agents involved coordinate and focus their care on the patient, sharing the same information systems with multi-Past and future of HIV infection.

In addition, com - bating the stigma and discrimination still faced by people who are HIV-positive is the second major issue that all rst world countries have yet to address. WHAT REFLECTIONS FROM AN ETHICAL POINT OF VIEW ARE RAISED? Diego Gracia It is not possible to talk about the ethics of HIV without recalling the heroic years when a death sentence, usually within fourteen months. This was the case for most of the 1980s. In addition to being an acute and deadly disease, its rapid led \"epidemic\", triggering uncontrolled fear among health profes-sionals and the general population, in some cases to the point of panic. In such a critical situation, conflicts have soared, and so has ethical reflection. It was common to see articles on eth - ics in large clinical journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA, Lancet or the British Medical Journal, in a previously unknown proportion. In those days it was not uncommon to say that only with the ex - ample of AIDS was it possible to explain the main chapters of an entire ethics course. There were many very serious problems key element of clinical activity: diagnosis. Thus, whether or not it was ask the patient's permis - sion to carry out the that the profes - considered himself be at risk and therefore believed he was entitled to know if the patient was HIV-positive, even against the patient's wishes. Another serious problem was that of data condentiality, especially in view of the need to protect patients' sexual partners. No less serious were the problems re - lated to treatment: Were health professionals obliged to assist them, or could they raise any The WHO itself had to intervene by reminding professionals that they were obliged to assist, and that the risk was minimal as long as they took the recommended protective measures into account. Another seri - ous problem was the dispersion and distribution of treatments when they became accessible, given their high cost. No less serious were the conflicts that arose with the testing of new antiretroviral drugs in Asian and African countries. And the list could go on. Today things are very different. HIV infection has gone from being an acute to a chronic disease, from epidemic to endemic, and from being seen as a public health issue to a private hygiene problem. The latter is something is rarely yet is becoming increasingly important. I will therefore focus my analysis on this point. Western medicine did not have truly effective therapeutic resources, both medical and surgical, until the 19th century. It was then that experimental pharmacology and pharmaco-logical therapeutics appeared as in its incursion into the three cavities of The reality we live in our society, and that of people living with HIV infection in particular, requires solutions to identi - ed, well-known, unresolved issues. These are issues that have to do with controlling the epidemic in our environment and improving the quality of life of people living with the infec - tion. In industrialised countries, there remains a high risk of HIV transmission among people who engage in - sion occurs primarily from people who do not know they are and are therefore to achieve control of viral replication could stop transmission, reduce the incidence of new infections and, overall, control the epidemic with all the associated benets [159]. It is persons, the necessary procedures have not been put in place to achieve this goal. At present, most countries, including Spain, rely for diagnosis on the risk practices, which has clearly proved to be insufcient. In order to bring the epidemic under control, it should be noted that the proposed measure of identifying all infect - ed persons as early as possible and treating them, although the most important, is not sufcient. In the meantime, oth - er measures are needed to limit the transmission of the virus. An effective method of prevention has also practices not only in clinical trials, but also in Recent population-based experience that PrEP administration is associated sig-nicant decrease the of HIV infection, regardless of percentage of patients with an undetectable viral load [160]. In Spain, this measure has been approved. Improving the quality of life of people with HIV infection, which is another unnished business, has nothing to do with the quality of life associated with health status. People on an - tiretroviral treatment are healthy enough to lead normal so - cial, family and working lives. The quality of life they lack is related to the stigma attached to being HIV-positive and the discrimination they face at many levels, creating real social inequalities [161]. Again, it is suffering from a chronic illness can become a reason for discrimination. In this case, the way to combat it is more complex, but it is undoubtedly where a society such as ours is most likely to demonstrate the ability to solve problems that are not easy and that affect a large number of people. Conclusion: In neighbouring countries, HIV infection still presents challenges that have not yet been overcome. Beyond the limited room for improvement in antiretroviral therapy or the achievement of desired HIV cures and vaccines, so-ciety and people living with HIV infection need action to achieve urgent goals. Control of the in an en-vironment such as ours can be achieved if measures of Past and future of HIV infection. A document based on expert opinion E. Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 131-156 149the coup de grace in the middle of the same century with the appearance of penicillin. This was so revolutionary that the 1960s witnessed a profound change in social and cultural habits known as the \"sexual revolution\". The old controls \"repression\" was replaced by permissiveness or \"sexual freedom\". From one extreme to the other... Until 1981, when HIV infection appeared on the horizon. It started out as a very acute and aggressive disease, which medicine had to control, of course, through new therapies. And this it did. The pace of new drugs and their increasing efcacy has dramati - landscape disease over the course of a few decades. But medicine is not nished with it. What has been achieved thus far was its transformation from chronic disease. It would therefore seem that the time had come to turn to the strategies that are most appropri - ate and effective in this type of disease: those that have to do with lifestyle and risk practices. It was time to remember the old story of sex res unnatural. By then, however, the old historical references had been lost, and there was a growing conviction that HIV infection was a purely medical, or rather a pharmacological, problem. Instead of acting was sufcient oneself chemical, physical or pharmacological agents. It is doubtful that this is the only, let alone the most ap - propriate strategy to control this infection. Some data are alarming to say the least. One of them is the change in leisure practices, shifting from daytime to night-time, in which in or - der to resist the fatigue of a sleepless night it is drink alcohol (\"binge in which individ - ual responsibility is diluted within the group dynamic. All this leads to an irresponsible management of the body, consump - tion, and sexuality. disinhibition\", which uses the other person as an object, or as Kant would say, as a pure \"means\" and not as an \"end\" in itself. moral and not merely natural beings, precisely because we have the status of an \"end\" and not merely a \"means\" to be used at the whim of others. Sexu - ality, like food and alcohol, must be managed wisely. Prudence is the capacity for self-control, and it is responsibility in the management of one's actions and life. And it is also health, private health, something that needs to be promoted through education; through education in general, also through health education. Health professionals are also educators, and in matters such as those we are analysing here, essential edu - cators. The aim of medicine is not only to cure disease, but to promote health and the prudent and responsible management of the body. At a time when we are approaching the ideal of precision medicine or personalised medicine, we cannot forget that there will be no personalised medicine without educating people in the responsible and prudent management of their bodies and sexuality. This is something that the ancient cavities, thanks to the three great novelties introduced in second half of the century: antisepsis and asepsis, anaesthesia and haemostasis. For the rst time in history, the doctor saw him - self as being able to cure diseases. Add to this that from the end of the 18th century, as a consequence of enlightened des - potism, governments began to turn health into a political ob - jective, which led to the birth of what was rst called Sanitary Police and later Sanitary Policy or Public Health. This revolution was so that the strategies developed by physicians from antiquity until the end of the 18th century were no longer of interest. Given their very limit - ed therapeutic arsenal, classical physicians sought above all to promote the health of the population by means of very sim-ple and elementary procedures for the drew up a catalogue of six major chapters for the promotion of private hygiene. This is what was known in the Middle Ages as the catalogue of unnatural sex res non naturals. The six chapters were: environment (what the Hippocratic writing On Airs, Wa ters and vigilia), ment of major chapters was the best way - ment. If certainly become to certain chronic diseases, such as type II diabetes. As hardly anyone remembers this history anymore, it is worth pointing out that this catalogue was fully valid until the end of the 18th century, and that in the last two hun-dred years that it has been losing importance in the and hygiene, it has practically disappeared. However, is still valid in the case chronic illnesses, as these are most often of infection is now \"sexually transmitted diseases\" (STDs). These diseases also have a long from which we can perhaps learn something. For example, we can learn from the fact that they were called \"moral, secret or shameful diseases\".

They were diseases directly related to lifestyle habits.

Health and non-health workers (H &NH-W) in a hospital are more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population. We studied this in-fection in these workers of Segovia\u00b4s Hospital after the rst wave. Material methods. Monocentric, observational, cross-sectional study, carried out between April 29 14, 2020. The infection was diagnosed by capillary immuno - chromatography test for IgG and / or IgM antibodies, or PCR. Work, health, and exposure variables were studied. Results. A total of 1,335 H &NH-W participated in the study out of a total of 1,667 (80.1%), 79.3% women, with a mean age of 47.3 years, and 47.1 for men. by 16.8%. The continued use of Personal Pro-tective Equipment (PPE) and the administration of nebuliza - tions presented an OR of 0.54 and 0.46 The - toms 9.31), ageusia (OR 3.05), and fever (OR 1.94). Today, about 75% of H &NH-W were infected in the rst a higher prevalence of infection. Almost a quarter of those infected were asymptomatic. The continuous use of PPE was associated with a lower prevalence, for that the administration of nebulisations could be safe.

Los trabajadores sanitarios y no sanitarios (TSyNS) de un hospital est\u00e1n m\u00e1s expuestos al contagio por SARS-CoV-2 que la poblaci\u00f3n general. Estudiamos la prevalen - cia de esta infecci\u00f3n en los trabajadores del hospital de Sego - via tras la primera ola. Material y m\u00e9todos. Estudio monoc\u00e9ntrico, observacio- nal, transversal, realizado entre el 29 de abril y el 14 de mayo de 2020. Se diagnostic\u00f3 la infecci\u00f3n mediante test de inmuno - cromatograf\u00eda capilar para anticuerpos IgG y/o IgM, o PCR. Se estudiaron variables laborales, de salud, y de exposici\u00f3n. Resultados. Participaron en el estudio 1.335 TSyNS de un total 1.667 (80,1%), un 79,3% mujeres, con una edad media de 47,3 a\u00f1os, y de 47,1 para los hombres. La prevalencia de infec - tados fue del 21,95%, el 24,7% asintom\u00e1ticos. La edad presen - t\u00f3 una OR signicativa de 1,02/a\u00f1o. La exposici\u00f3n extralaboral aument\u00f3 la prevalencia un 16,8%. El uso continuado del Equi - po de Protecci\u00f3n Individual (EPI) y la administraci\u00f3n de nebu - lizaciones presentaron una OR de 0,54 y 0,46 respectivamente. Los s\u00edntomas asociados a mayor prevalencia fueron anosmia (OR 9,31), ageusia (OR 3,05), y ebre (OR 1,94). Hasta la fecha, el 75% de los TSyTNS infectados lo hicieron en la primera ola. Conclusiones. La prevalencia es mayor entre los TSyNS que en la poblaci\u00f3n general. La edad se asocia a una mayor prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n. Casi un 25% de los infectados fue asintom\u00e1tico. El uso de EPI de forma continuada se asoci\u00f3 a menor prevalencia. Los s\u00edntomas con mayor asociaci\u00f3n fueron ebre, anosmia, y ageusia.

Dentro de la patolog\u00eda previa se pregunt\u00f3 por hiperten - si\u00f3n arterial (HTA), diabetes, cardiopat\u00eda isqu\u00e9mica, hipercoles - terolemia, enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cr\u00f3nica (EPOC), inmunodepresi\u00f3n, y obesidad. Entre las tareas desempe\u00f1adas se pregunt\u00f3 si se hab\u00eda realizado: anamnesis y exploraci\u00f3n f\u00edsica, administraci\u00f3n de medicaci\u00f3n nebulizada, administraci\u00f3n de ox\u00edgeno a alto flujo, intubaci\u00f3n orotraqueal, manejo del paciente (como puede ser ayuda en su movilidad o traslado), o alguna otra tarea que im - plicara contacto con el paciente o sus muestras cl\u00ednicas. Los s\u00edntomas que se recogieron fueron ebre, mialgias, tos, dolor de garganta, dolor de cabeza, p\u00e9rdida de olfato (anosmia), p\u00e9rdida de gusto (ageusia), sensaci\u00f3n de mareo, y diarrea. Test de anticuerpos. Las muestras de sangre se obtuvie- ron mediante venopunci\u00f3n. La detecci\u00f3n de anticuerpos (Ac) IgG o IgM se realiz\u00f3 en el suero empleando un kit basado en la t\u00e9cnica cualitativa de inmunocromatograf\u00eda capilar (Diagnos - tic Kit for IgM/IgG Antibody to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (La - teral Flow), Livzon). La sensibilidad y especicidad combinada del test declarada por el fabricante es del 90,6 y 99,2% respec - tivamente [4], y las halladas mediante validaci\u00f3n independien-te por la FDA del 86.7% (IC 95% 70.3-94.7%), y 97.5% (IC 95% 91.3-99.3%) [5]. La interpretaci\u00f3n de la prueba se realiz\u00f3 de forma visual por el personal del laboratorio ajena por completo a la informaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica del sujeto. Determinaci\u00f3n del trabajador como infectado. Se consider\u00f3 trabajador infectado a todo aquel con un resultado positivo en la prueba de Livzon, o en alguna prueba anterior: inmunocromatograf\u00eda para Ac IgG/M, o reacci\u00f3n en cadena de la polimerasa (PCR). En la Tabla 1 se muestran los distintos patrones de resultado entre los sujetos considerados como in - fectados. Recogida de datos y an\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico. El registro de los datos se realiz\u00f3 en LibreOfceCalc v6.4.2.2 [6], y el an\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico mediante el programa Epidat v4.2 [7]. Las medias se muestran junto a sus desviaciones est\u00e1ndard (DE), y las pro - porciones junto a sus intervalos de conanza al 95% (IC95%). La asociaci\u00f3n entre la prevalencia y las variables de edad, g\u00e9 - nero, variables de salud, y de exposici\u00f3n laboral y extralaboral, se estableci\u00f3 mediante un modelo de regresi\u00f3n log\u00edstica que las inclu\u00eda a todas ellas. El modelo de regresi\u00f3n log\u00edstica para asociaci\u00f3n de prevalencia y s\u00edntomas se ajust\u00f3 seg\u00fan edad y g\u00e9nero. El modelo para la asociaci\u00f3n con grupo sangu\u00edneo y Rh se ajust\u00f3 seg\u00fan \u00e9stos, la edad y el g\u00e9nero. RESULTADOS Sobre un total de 1.667 TSyNS se presentaron a la prueba de detecci\u00f3n de anticuerpos 1.638 (98,2%), y de ellos 1.335 se INTRODUCCI\u00d3N Hasta el 8 de septiembre de 2020, Espa\u00f1a era uno de los pa\u00edses europeos m\u00e1s severamente afectados por la COVID-19, con m\u00e1s de 525,000 casos conrmados, y m\u00e1s de 29.000 muertes [1]. Hasta el 21 de mayo de 2020 se hab\u00edan notica - do a la Red Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiol\u00f3gica (RENAVE) 40.921 casos de COVID-19 en personal sanitario con diagn\u00f3sti - co previo al 11 de mayo de 2020, lo que supon\u00eda un 24,1% del total de casos de COVID-19 declarados a la RENAVE hasta esa fecha [2]. Los datos publicados en RENAVE son los declarados, y no tienen en cuenta los casos de trabajadores infectados asinto - m\u00e1ticos que no solicitaron asistencia sanitaria, o que no fue - ron sometidos a una prueba diagn\u00f3stica en un momento, el del inicio de la pandemia, de escasez de las mismas. Nuestro estudio pretende conocer cu\u00e1l fue la prevalen- cia real de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 inmediatamente tras la primera onda epid\u00e9mica entre los trabajadores sanitarios y no sanitarios (TSyNS) del Hospital General de Segovia, en Castilla y Le\u00f3n, e investigar su posible relaci\u00f3n con factores laborales, de salud, y de exposici\u00f3n, y encontrar los s\u00edntomas asociados a una mayor prevalencia. Para ello se ofreci\u00f3 a la totalidad de trabajadores del cen - tro sanitario una prueba de detecci\u00f3n de anticuerpos mediante inmunocromatograf\u00eda capilar (la \u00fanica prueba de detecci\u00f3n de anticuerpos disponible en aquel momento), adem\u00e1s de consi - derar el resultado de pruebas diagn\u00f3sticas previas si las hab\u00eda (inmunocromatograf\u00eda o PCR). MATERIAL Y M\u00c9TODOS Sujetos y dise\u00f1o del estudio. Estudio monoc\u00e9ntrico, observacional, transversal, dise\u00f1ado y realizado en el Hospi-tal General de Segovia (HGS), con 375 camas y 1.667 TSyNS, que da cobertura a la totalidad de la poblaci\u00f3n de la provincia: 153.478 habitantes (76.445 mujeres y 77.033 hombres) seg\u00fan censo del 1 de enero de 2020 [3]. El estudio fue aprobado por el Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica e Investigaci\u00f3n (CEIm) de la Gerencia de Asistencia Sanitaria de Segovia en abril 2020. Durante el per\u00edodo de 29 de abril a 14 de mayo de 2020 el Servicio de Medicina Preventiva ofreci\u00f3 a la totalidad de los TSyNS del Hospital General de Segovia la realizaci\u00f3n de una prueba r\u00e1pida de detecci\u00f3n de anticuerpos en suero o sangre total contra el SARS-CoV-2. Durante la extracci\u00f3n se invit\u00f3 a la participaci\u00f3n volunta- ria en el estudio, y a aquellos que aceptaron se les entreg\u00f3 un cuestionario y se les solicit\u00f3 consentimiento para el acceso a su historial cl\u00ednico con el n de poder recoger el resultado nal de esta prueba y de las que se hubieran realizado con anterioridad. Cuestionario. Las variables estudiadas fueron g\u00e9nero, edad, categor\u00eda profesional, servicio donde desempe\u00f1aba sus funciones, duraci\u00f3n de la jornada laboral, patolog\u00eda previa conocida, s\u00edntomas que sugirieran infecci\u00f3n por coronavirus, Prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 durante la primera oleada de la pandemia entre personal sanitario y no sanitario del Hospital General de Segovia, Castilla y Le\u00f3nC.

La prevalencia fue del 23.9% entre los trabajadores que prestaron atenci\u00f3n directa a pacientes con COVID-19 (m\u00e9dico/o, enfermero/a, TCAE, celador/a, y t\u00e9cnico/a de radio - diagn\u00f3stico), y del 16,8% en el resto (diferencia del 7,1% IC 95% 2,4-11,8%, p 0.003). La edad present\u00f3 asociaci\u00f3n con una mayor prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n, con una OR ajustada de 1,02/a\u00f1o (IC 95% 1,01-1,04, p 0,006). Las diferencias observadas en la prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n seg\u00fan el g\u00e9nero, la categor\u00eda profesional, el servicio, las horas de trabajo semanales, o los factores de salud individuales no presentaron signicaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica (Tabla 2). A\u00fan as\u00ed, las ca - tegor\u00edas profesionales con una mayor prevalencia fueron la de T\u00e9cnicos en Cuidados Auxiliares de Enfermer\u00eda (TCAE), M\u00e9dicos Internos Residentes (MIR), y el Personal de limpieza. El porcentaje de infectados fue menor entre los que decla - raron usar el EPI siempre (OR 0,54, IC 95% 0,29-0,99, p 0,047), y entre los que administraron tratamiento nebulizado (OR 0,46, IC95% 0,26-0,82, p 0,008).prestaron a colaborar en estudio y rmaron el consen - timiento informado (80,1% del total de trabajadores). El 79,3% de los participantes en el estudio fueron mujeres (Tabla 2), y las edades estuvieron comprendidas entre los 20 y 69 a\u00f1os. La edad media fue respectivamente de 47,3 (DE 12) a\u00f1os para las mujeres, y 47,1 (DE 12,02) para los hombres. Entre los 1.335 participantes en 20 (1,5%) no pudo obte - nerse el resultado de pruebas diagn\u00f3sticas previas. De los 1315 restantes a 510 (38,78%) se les hab\u00eda realizado al menos una prueba diagn\u00f3stica previa: PCR a 453 (34,45%), inmunocroma - tograf\u00eda capilar para IgG-M a 22 (1,67%), y ambas a 35 (2,66%). Casi el 9% de los participantes con PCR positiva previa mostraron un resultado negativo en las pruebas r\u00e1pidas de anticuerpos. Este descenso concuerda con lo publicado: un 7 y 14% a las 3 y 6 semanas de infecci\u00f3n respectivamente [8], incluso cuando la detecci\u00f3n de anticuerpos se realiza mediante quimioluminiscencia [9].

De los infectados en la primera ola, un 4.43% requirieron ingreso (13) y de \u00e9stos, un 38,46% necesitaron de cuidados intensivos (5). A fecha de septiembre de 2021, seg\u00fan datos proporciona - dos por el Servicio de Medicina Preventiva de nuestro hospital, no ha habido m\u00e1s muertes entre los TS y TNS del Hospital por COVID-19, siendo el n\u00famero total de trabajadores infectados 391 (23,45%), y de \u00e9stos ingresaron 19 (4,86% de los trabaja - dores infectados), requiriendo de cuidados intensivos 8 (2%). DISCUSI\u00d3N Hemos encontrado una elevada prevalencia de TSyNS in - fectados por SARS-CoV-2 al nal de la primera ola epid\u00e9mica de la pandemia, similar a la registrada entre la totalidad del personal sanitario en Espa\u00f1a (RENAVE), y que se sit\u00faa entre las m\u00e1s altas de las publicadas entre trabajadores hospita-larios: 11,2% en personal sanitario en el Hospital Cl\u00ednico de Barcelona [11], 19,99% en personal sanitario en el Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada [9], o el 33,1% en personal sa - nitario y no sanitario del Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Alcorc\u00f3n [12]. Casi la totalidad trabajadores del hospital se contagiaron durante la primera ola de la pandemia (un 2% durante los 17 meses siguientes). Esta elevada prevalencia contrasta con la hallada en el estudio de seroprevalencia en Prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 durante la primera oleada de la pandemia entre personal sanitario y no sanitario del Hospital General de Segovia, Castilla y Le\u00f3nC. Avellaneda Mart\u00ednez, et al. Rev Esp Quimioter 2022;35(2): 157-164 163la poblaci\u00f3n general que el Ministerio de Sanidad y Consu - mo realiz\u00f3 en aquel momento [8]: 5% en Espa\u00f1a, 6,9% en Castilla-Le\u00f3n, 11,8% en Segovia. Entre los factores que a juicio de los autores pueden ex- plicar la gran diferencia observada en la prevalencia entre el personal de nuestro hospital y la poblaci\u00f3n a la que aten - d\u00eda, incluso entre aquellos que no prestaron una asistencia directa a pacientes con COVID-19, y la dr\u00e1stica ca\u00edda en con-tagios posterior a la primera onda epid\u00e9mica, creemos que puede estar la mayor exposici\u00f3n a sujetos infectados, sumada a unas medidas de protecci\u00f3n insucientes: carencia inicial de equipos de protecci\u00f3n individual en el contexto de una escasez mundial de los mismos, ausencia de circuitos diferen - ciados para pacientes sospechosos de infecci\u00f3n, escasez de pruebas diagn\u00f3sticas entre trabajadores en un momento de muy baja disponibilidad global, alta prevalencia de trabaja - dores infectados asintom\u00e1ticos, y que trabajadores sintom\u00e1 - ticos siguieran desempe\u00f1ando sus funciones ante la escasez de personal. Se sabe que la edad es un factor de mal pron\u00f3stico en la COVID-19, pero hasta donde conocemos \u00e9sta es la primera vez que se observa que tambi\u00e9n es una variable asociada con una mayor prevalencia de la enfermedad. Se sabe que el uso continuado de las mascarillas autol - trantes (respiradores), no intermitente, y no s\u00f3lo en situaciones o tareas identicadas como de riesgo, protegen a los TSyNS del contagio [13]. En concordancia con este hecho hemos observado que uso del EPI se asocia con una menor prevalencia de con - tagio. Y \u00e9ste fen\u00f3meno podr\u00eda explicar tambi\u00e9n la menor pre - valencia entre trabajadores que administraron tratamiento ne - bulizado, un procedimiento que a priori deber\u00eda tener un efecto contrario por la elevada generaci\u00f3n de aerosoles. Creemos que cuando administraba tratamiento nebulizado el trabajador ten\u00eda una percepci\u00f3n de mayor riesgo de contagio, y por ello pudo tener mayor diligencia en la utilizaci\u00f3n de los EPI y/o redujo el tiempo que permaneci\u00f3 en la sala donde se administraban. La elevada proporci\u00f3n de trabajadores infectados sin s\u00edn - tomas es importante porque contribuy\u00f3 a la propagaci\u00f3n de la infecci\u00f3n. No podemos determinar cu\u00e1ntos de los trabajadores infectados asintom\u00e1ticos lo eran realmente o se encontraban en per\u00edodo pre-sintom\u00e1tico. Sin embargo, los estudios publica - dos indican que, salvo en personas de edad avanzada, el por - centaje de infectados asintom\u00e1ticos que desarrollan s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s adelante es muy peque\u00f1o [14]. La infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2 en TSyNS de nuestro centro hospitalario parece ser un riesgo ocupacional, sin que hayamos encontrado diferencias entre categor\u00edas profesionales, servi-cios, ni duraci\u00f3n de la jornada. Incluso los trabajadores que no realizaron atenci\u00f3n directa a pacientes con COVID-19 presen - tan una elevada prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n. La edad es una varia - ble asociada a mayor prevalencia de infecci\u00f3n. El uso general y continuado del EPI es una medida eficaz para reducir el riesgo de contagio. No hemos encontrado relaci\u00f3n entre prevalen - cia, variables de salud, ni grupo sangu\u00edneo. Fiebre, anosmia, y ageusia, son los s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s asociados a la COVID-19.AGRADECIMIENTOS Agradecer a todo el personal del hospital que de forma desinteresada particip\u00f3 en el estudio rellenado el cuestionario, as\u00ed como el inter\u00e9s mostrado por los resultados del estudio.

El objetivo de nuestro estudio fue analizar las t\u00e9cnicas de sonicaci\u00f3n y Maki para el diagn\u00f3stico de la coloni - zaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter y la bacteriemia relacionada con el cat\u00e9ter (CRBSI) en pacientes ingresados en UCI. Material y m\u00e9todo. Estudio observacional y prospectivo en una Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos. Se incluyeron pacientes con alg\u00fan cat\u00e9ter venoso central (CVC) insertado al menos du - rante 7 d\u00edas y sospecha de sospecha de infecci\u00f3n relacionada con el cat\u00e9ter (IRC) (nuevo episodio de ebre o sepsis). Se rea - liz\u00f3 t\u00e9cnica de Maki y posteriormente sonicaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter. Comparamos \u00e1reas bajo la curva (AUC) de Maki, sonicaci\u00f3n y combinaci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas para el diagn\u00f3stico de colonizaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter y de CRBSI. Resultados. Se incluyeron 94 CVC de 87 episodios de sos - pecha de IRC. Encontramos 14 casos de colonizaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter y 10 casos de CRBSI. De los 14 casos de colonizaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter, 7 (50,0%) fueron detectados por Maki y t\u00e9cnicas de sonicaci\u00f3n, 6 (42,9%) fueron detectados solo por la t\u00e9cnica de Maki y 1 (7,1%) fue detectado solo por la t\u00e9cnica de sonicaci\u00f3n. De los 10 CRBSI, 6 (60,0%) fueron detectados por t\u00e9cnicas de Maki y sonicaci\u00f3n, 4 (40,0%) fueron detectados solo por la t\u00e9cnica de Maki, y ninguno solo por la t\u00e9cnica de sonica-ci\u00f3n. Encontramos mayor AUC con Maki que en la sonicaci\u00f3n para el diagn\u00f3stico de CRBSI (p=0.02) y para el diagn\u00f3stico de colonizaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter (p=0.03). No encontramos diferencias signicativas en AUC entre Maki technique y combi - naci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicas para el diagn\u00f3stico de CRBSI (p=0.32) y para el diagn\u00f3stico de colonizaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter (p=0.32). Conclusiones. La sonicaci\u00f3n no proporcion\u00f3 rentabilidad a la t\u00e9cnica de Maki para el diagn\u00f3stico de colonizaci\u00f3n de la punta del cat\u00e9ter y CRBSI.

Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) es una causa frecuente de queratitis bacteriana en ciertas \u00e1reas geo - gr\u00e1cas. Presenta un alto porcentaje de resistencia a meticili - na, lo que conere resistencia cruzada a beta-lact\u00e1micos y en algunas ocasiones tambi\u00e9n resistencia a otros grupos de anti - bacterianos. Analizamos variables cl\u00ednicas y microbiol\u00f3gicas en pacientes con queratitis infecciosa por SE. M\u00e9todos. Se analizaron retrospectivamente las historias cl\u00ednicas de 43 pacientes con sospecha de queratitis infecciosa y conrmaci\u00f3n microbiol\u00f3gica para SE, entre octubre de 2017 y octubre de 2020. Se analizaron las caracter\u00edsticas cl\u00ednicas (fac - tores de riesgo, tama\u00f1o de las lesiones, tratamiento, evoluci\u00f3n) y microbiol\u00f3gicas (susceptibilidad a antibi\u00f3ticos) y se compa - raron grupos de pacientes con infecci\u00f3n resistente (MRSE) y sensible a meticilina (MSSE). Resultados. El 37,2% de las queratitis fueron por MRSE. Todos los aislados fueron sensibles a vancomicina y linezolid. Las tasas de resistencia a tetraciclinas y ciprofloxacino fueron 50% y 56% en el grupo de MRSE, y 11% y 7% en el grupo de MSSE. Las caracter\u00edsticas cl\u00ednicas, incluido el tama\u00f1o de la lesi\u00f3n, la afectaci\u00f3n del eje visual, la inflamaci\u00f3n de la c\u00e1mara anterior, la presencia de factores de riesgo y el tiempo de se - guimiento, no mostraron diferencias estad\u00edsticamente signi - cativas entre los grupos. Conclusiones. MRSE es una causa frecuente de las que - ratitis infecciosas producidas por SE y presenta una alta tasa de resistencia a m\u00faltiples f\u00e1rmacos.

The main limitation of study is the small number of pa- tients included, although to our knowledge there are no long comparative series of S. epidermidis keratitis. Other limitations the risk of overdiagnosis and attribute the etiology to the local eye microbiota, samples from the healthy eye and the affected eye could have been analyzed in parallel, in order to conrm the ndings of the cultures.

Palabras clave: Sepsis, Medicina Interna, mortalidad corto plazo, complicaciones, reingresos INTRODUCTION Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals in Spain and its incidence and mortality is than other serious medical en - tities, reaching 40% in cases of septic shock [1,2]. Prognosis of sepsis and septic shock is to the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms and the administra of organized detection and treatment of sepsis, reduce mortality by up to 50% (3,4,9,10]. In our country, the Sepsis code protocol (SCP) has been endorsed by the main scientic societies [11,12]. In this context, a multidisciplinary team was formed in our hospi - tal in 2013. Its objective was to develop, promote and update a protocol to improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis, not only those admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), but al-so patients in conventional wards. guide on on Surviving others. - mented in the hospital\u00b4s clinical practice in 2015 Most of the evidence on the impact of these early detec - tion and management packages on sepsis patients comes from those hospitalized in the ICU [1-5]. This group of individuals usually share some characteristics such age in conventional hospital units in case of medicine (IM): the range of patients is broader including morbidity, age or functional dependence [14,15]. Currently, there the clinical course of these patients, who account for at least whom the code is not activated at the time of sepsis diagnosis. We think it could be research line to explore the best management op-tions for this hugely diverse group of patients. Accordingly, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Sepsis Code (SC) on the morbidity and mor - tality sepsis patients of of a Sepsis Code Program in medical patient management: a cohort study in an Internal Medicine wardA.

Regarding comorbidities, the overall median CCI and the of patients with immunosuppression, did not differ between cohorts and were similar to those of reference series [33,35]. It is notable that half of patients had risk factors for MDRB infection. More than half status and a third showed severe deterioration. There are sig - nicant differences between groups, with a worse functional status in no-SC group.

Treatment was more intensive in group A especially fluid resuscitation and it could be the reason for the higher incidence of heart failure. Acute confusional syndrome was also higher in group A.

Our study has also several strengths. It includes a large cohort of patients from IM unit and disabilities. the SC. More performed in group. Nevertheless, a longer antibiotic treatment is also administered. This group has better infection control rate at 72 hours, less complications and lower short-term mortality. On the contrary, in-hospital stay, heart failure episode and read - missions increase in patients managed with this protocol.

It was asked about assistance and management in the emergency room in the care of patients with suspected sepsis. The results are influx to / day vs medium-low <200). Results. A total of 250 Spanish EDs responded (89%). Sepsis protocols are available in week - ly sepsis treated ranged from 0-5 per week in 39 (71%) ED, 6-10 per week in 10 (18%), 11-15 per week in 4 (7%), and more than 15 activations per week in 3 centers sepsis of the hospitals, SIRS in 6 while in (29.7%) they used both criteria simultaneously.

Describir el abordaje que se realiza a los pacientes con sospecha de sepsis en los servicios de urgencias hospitala - rios (SUH) espa\u00f1oles y analizar si existen diferencias atendiendo al tama\u00f1o del hospital y la afluencia a urgencias en el territorio. M\u00e9todo. Encuesta estructurada a los responsables de los 282 SUH p\u00fablicos que atienden adultos 24 horas/d\u00eda, 365 d\u00edas/a\u00f1o. Se pregunt\u00f3 sobre asistencia y manejo en urgencias en la atenci\u00f3n a pacientes con sospecha de sepsis. Los resultados se comparan seg\u00fan tama\u00f1o del hospital (grande 500 camas vs medio-peque\u00f1o < 500) y afluencia en urgencias (alta 200 visitas/d\u00eda vs media-baja < 200). Resultados. Respondieron 250 SUH espa\u00f1oles (89%). En 163 (65%) SUH se dispone de protocolos de sepsis. La mediana de sepsis semanales atendidas variaban desde 0-5 por sema - na en 39 (71%) SUH, 6-10 por semana en 10 (18%), 11-15 por semana en 4 (7%), y m\u00e1s de 15 activaciones por semana en 3 centros (3,6%). Los criterios utilizados para la activaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo sepsis (CS) fueron el qSOFA/SOFA en 105 (63,6%) de los hospitales, SIRS en 6 (3,6%), mientras que en 49 (29,7%) utilizaban ambos criterios de forma simultanea. En 79 centros el CS estaba informatizado y en 56 exist\u00edan herramientas de ayuda a la toma de decisiones. Un 48% (79 de 163) de los SUH dispon\u00edan de datos de cumplimiento de medidas. En el 61% (99 de 163) de SUH exist\u00eda formaci\u00f3n en sepsis y en el 56% (55 de 99) \u00e9sta era peri\u00f3dica. Atendiendo al tama\u00f1o del hospital, los hospitales grandes participaban m\u00e1s frecuentemente como receptores de enfermos con CS y dispon\u00edan de servicio/unidad de infecciosas, de sepsis y de corta estancia, microbi\u00f3logo e infect\u00f3logo de guardia.

Es por ello que se dise\u00f1\u00f3 el presente estudio, cuyo objetivo principal fue cono - cer el abordaje que se realiza actualmente a los pacientes con sospecha de sepsis en los SUH espa\u00f1oles, y averiguar si existen diferencias en funci\u00f3n del tama\u00f1o del hospital y de la afluen - cia de pacientes que recibe dicho SUH. M\u00c9TODO Este estudio se basa en una encuesta de opini\u00f3n en la que se recogieron, por una parte, datos gen\u00e9ricos de los hospitales y de sus SUH (poblaci\u00f3n de referencia, n\u00famero de camas de hospitalizaci\u00f3n, existencia de unidad/servicio de infecciosas y microbi\u00f3logo e infect\u00f3logo de guardia de presencia f\u00edsica todo el a\u00f1o y n\u00famero de atenciones diarias) y, por otra parte, da - tos espec\u00edcos de la atenci\u00f3n practicada a los pacientes que consultaron por sospecha de sepsis en los SUH (Material suple - mentario - Anexo 1). La encuesta se dise\u00f1\u00f3 entre septiembre y octubre de 2020, y para evitar el efecto de la pandemia CO - VID-19 en la actividad asistencial, se solicitaron los datos del a\u00f1o 2019 [9,10]. El universo a estudio fue todos los SUH del sistema p\u00fabli - co de salud espa\u00f1ol que atienden urgencias generales de pa-cientes adultos, 24 horas al d\u00eda, 7 d\u00edas a la semana y los 365 d\u00edas (24/7/365) en el a\u00f1o 2019. El estudio se dise\u00f1\u00f3 en base a una intenci\u00f3n de inclusi\u00f3n total, con el objetivo de obtener un mapa de la atenci\u00f3n a la sepsis en los SUH de nuestro pa\u00eds. La fuente de centros la constituy\u00f3 el Cat\u00e1logo Nacional de Hos - pitales de 2019 [11] con 924 centros. Se excluyeron 642 (323 por no ser generales, 315 privados sin concierto, 2 militares y 2 cerrados el 2019), por lo que el universo a encuestar fue de 282 SUH. La encuesta se remiti\u00f3 al responsable del SUH, con quien previamente se hab\u00eda contactado por tel\u00e9fono para explicarle el proyecto y solicitar su colaboraci\u00f3n. Se envi\u00f3 telem\u00e1tica - mente un enlace a la encuesta en l\u00ednea para poder completarla y tambi\u00e9n en formato pdf por correo electr\u00f3nico por si pre - fer\u00eda escanearla y enviar las respuestas por e-mail. Si despu\u00e9s de 3 contactos no se recib\u00eda respuesta se consideraba ese SUH como no respondedor. Las entrevistas se realizaron durante di - ciembre de 2020 y enero y febrero de 2021. An\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico. Los datos continuos se presentan como mediana y rango intercuartil (RIC), y los discretos como valores absolutos y porcentajes. Los centros se agruparon en funci\u00f3n del n\u00famero de camas (grandes 500; medios/peque-\u00f1os < 500) y de la afluencia de pacientes (alta 200/d\u00eda; me- dia/baja < 200) siguiendo la denici\u00f3n de trabajos previos [12]. La comparaci\u00f3n entre los grupos se realiz\u00f3 mediante el test no param\u00e9trico de Mann-Whitney si las variables eran continuas y mediante el test de ji cuadrado si las variables eran discretas. Un valor de p < 0,05 se consider\u00f3 estad\u00edsticamente signica - tivo. Consideraciones \u00e9ticas. Por las caracter\u00edsticas del estu- dio, \u00e9ste no fue valorado por ning\u00fan Comit\u00e9 \u00c9tico en Inves-more frequently as recipients of patients with sepsis and duty. Conclusion. Most EDs have sepsis protocols, but there is room for improvement. The computerization and development of alerts for diagnosis and treatment still have a long way to go in EDs. Key words: Sepsis, sepsis code, emergency departments INTRODUCCI\u00d3N La incidencia de la infecci\u00f3n en los servicios de urgencias hospitalarios (SUH) supon\u00eda el 14,3% de las visitas diarias hace una d\u00e9cada [1], aunque se estima que esta ha podido aumen - tar en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os [2]. Por otra parte, la incidencia y la prevalencia de la sepsis no resulta tan clara de conocer, ya que ambas var\u00edan en funci\u00f3n de las deniciones utilizadas, las cua - les han ido cambiando en el devenir de los a\u00f1os. Esto da lugar a que puede registrarse una incidencia del 6,2% del total de las infecciones diagnosticadas, si se utilizan los criterios cl\u00e1sicos de sospecha de infecci\u00f3n y s\u00edndrome de respuesta inflamatoria sist\u00e9mica (SIRS) [1], o del 30% si se tienen en cuenta otras de - niciones o criterios [3,4]. Se sabe que la sepsis es una de las enfermedades deno - minadas tiempo-dependientes, en las cuales es de suma im - portancia su detecci\u00f3n precoz para poder establecer el trata - miento lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible, ya que la demora en su inicio y mantenimiento se asocia a un aumento de la morbilidad y mortalidad en los pacientes que la sufren [5]. Desde la publi - caci\u00f3n de las \u00faltimas deniciones de la sepsis en el a\u00f1o 2016 [6,7] se han establecido m\u00e9todos diagn\u00f3sticos de cara a iden - ticar precozmente al paciente s\u00e9ptico basados en el uso de diferentes escalas de gravedad como el Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), el National Early o el Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) y la determinaci\u00f3n de biomarcadores como el \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico, la pro - te\u00edna C reactiva (PCR) o la procalcitonina (PCT). A\u00fan hoy sigue abierto el debate cient\u00edco sobre cu\u00e1les son los mejores crite - rios para identicar el paciente con sepsis en los servicios de urgencias [8]. En esta l\u00ednea, ya hace unos a\u00f1os se cre\u00f3 el concepto de c\u00f3digo sepsis (CS), cuyo objetivo \u00faltimo es facilitar la detecci\u00f3n de los enfermos con sospecha de sepsis en cualquier nivel asis - tencial, e intentar estandarizar el cumplimiento de toda una serie de medidas terap\u00e9uticas desde el minuto cero y durante las primeras horas tras su detecci\u00f3n, y todo ello con equipos multidisciplinares, con la implicaci\u00f3n de diferentes especialida-des m\u00e9dicas, quir\u00fargicas y de enfermer\u00eda. A pesar de todo esto la sepsis sigue teniendo cifras in- aceptables de mortalidad llegando en el caso del shock s\u00e9ptico al 15-50% [3], siendo a\u00fan una patolog\u00eda infradiagnosticada en todos los \u00e1mbitos sanitarios. En los SUH se cree que pueden pasar inadvertidos casi el 50% de los pacientes s\u00e9pticos [4]. A\u00fan hoy, se desconoce el grado de implantaci\u00f3n del CS en el \u00e1mbito hospitalario de nuestro pa\u00eds, as\u00ed como la dispo -Mapa de la situaci\u00f3n actual de la atenci\u00f3n a la sepsis en los servicios de urgencias espa\u00f1oles F.

El resto de ele - mentos comparados se observan en la Tabla 3. La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados que se obtienen al com- parar los SUH en funci\u00f3n de la afluencia de pacientes, ya sea esta alta ( 200 visitas/d\u00eda) o media/baja (< 200). En las Figuras 1 y 2 se representa la implementaci\u00f3n del CS en las diferentes Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas. DISCUSI\u00d3N El CS se ha ido instaurando estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os de forma progresiva con diferentes iniciativas que han permitido el de - sarrollo de distintos protocolos, lo que ha podido ayudar a su implantaci\u00f3n en los SUH [13-15]. Se ha descrito alguna esti - maci\u00f3n que jaba la implantaci\u00f3n del CS entre los SUH espa-\u00f1oles en alrededor del 30-50% [4]. Sin embargo, de nuestro tigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica. Se garantiz\u00f3 la condencialidad de los datos individuales y se solicit\u00f3 su aprobaci\u00f3n verbal para participar voluntariamente en el estudio. RESULTADOS De los 282 responsables de los SUH contactados respon - dieron 250 (89%), con una tasa de respuesta superior al 80% en las Ciudades Aut\u00f3nomas de Ceuta, Melilla y en 14 de las 17 Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas (Tabla 1). De los 250 SUH, 59 (24%) correspond\u00edan a hospitales grandes y 114 (46%) reportaban una actividad asistencial alta, con una poblaci\u00f3n total asigna-da de 19,5 millones los hospitales grandes (mediana: 0,35, RIC: 0,30-0,46) y 26,2 millones los hospitales medianos/peque\u00f1os (mediana: 0,13, RIC: 0,06-0,19). En el a\u00f1o 2019 los 250 SUH analizados realizaron 19,4 millones de asistencias (mediana: 0,07, RIC: 0,03-0,11). El 46% de los SUH dispon\u00edan de servicio o unidad de in - fecciosas de hospitalizaci\u00f3n y el 33% y el 5% contaban, res - pectivamente, con microbi\u00f3logo e infect\u00f3logo de guardia 24/7/365. Solamente 21 SUH (8%) respondieron disponer de unidad de sepsis. Sin embargo, 99 de 249 (40%) eran recepto - res de enfermos con CS, 163 (65%) dispon\u00edan de protocolos de sepsis urgente y 114 (46%) de hospitalizaci\u00f3n. La mediana de sepsis semanales atendidas en estos SUH fue muy variable, 55 de 165 (33%) SUH respondieron conocer el n\u00famero de activa - ciones semanales, que variaban desde 0-5 por semana en 39 (71%) SUH, 6-10 por semana en 10 (18%), 11-15 por semana en 4 (7%), a hasta m\u00e1s de 15 activaciones por semana en 3 centros (3,6%). Al preguntar por las falsas activaciones, 31 de estos 55 (56%) SUH respondieron no tener ninguna, 15 (27%) un porcentaje de falsas activaciones inferior al 10% y 9 (16%) de m\u00e1s del 11%, estos \u00faltimos correspond\u00edan mayoritariamen - te a los centros que m\u00e1s CS activaban. En la mayor\u00eda de los casos (58%) el CS lo pod\u00eda activar medicina o enfermer\u00eda. Los criterios utilizados para la activa-ci\u00f3n del CS fueron el qSOFA/SOFA en 105 (64%) de los hospi - tales, SIRS en 6 (3,6%), mientras que en 49 (30%) utilizaban ambos criterios de forma simultanea. Cinco (3%) centros ma - nifestaron seguir criterios propios. En 79 centros el CS esta - ba informatizado y en 56 existen herramientas de ayuda a la toma de decisiones como calculadoras de escalas, sistemas de alerta o gu\u00edas para el uso de antimicrobianos. Un 48% (79 de 163) de los SUH dispon\u00edan de datos de cum - plimiento de medidas: toma de lactato en el 97%, hemocultivos y fluidoterapia en el 99% y antibioterapia precoz en el 100%. En 159 de 163 (98%) de los hospitales se utilizaban biomarcadores, siendo el lactato y la PCR los que se usaban mayoritariamente de forma rutinaria. En el 61% (99 de 163) de SUH exist\u00eda for - maci\u00f3n en sepsis y en el 56% (55 de 99) \u00e9sta era peri\u00f3dica.

Tal vez el hecho de que el CS sea un proceso con una gran heterogeneidad y la falta a\u00fan de una prueba diagn\u00f3stica est\u00e1ndar [22], unido a que no exista una t\u00e9cnica terap\u00e9utica tan efectiva como la reperfusi\u00f3n del tejido cardiaco o cerebral que desarrollan es-pecialidades muy espec\u00edcas, haya generado un retraso en su desarrollo global. En todo caso, pensamos que desde los ser-vicios de urgencias, al ser el primer eslab\u00f3n en la cadena asis - tencial de estos pacientes, se tendr\u00eda que impulsar medidas para el avance global del CS y liderar desde nuestro \u00e1mbito sanitario estas iniciativas [4]. No obstante, dado el car\u00e1cter transversal de esta patolog\u00eda es fundamental e imprescindi -trabajo se desprende que la implantaci\u00f3n de este c\u00f3digo su- pera ampliamente el 50% de los SUH de hospitales analizados, situ\u00e1ndose con los datos proporcionados por sus responsables en el 65%, lo que conrma la preocupaci\u00f3n por este problema entre los m\u00e9dicos de urgencias de nuestro pa\u00eds, si bien hay di - ferencias entre las diferentes Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas. Cree - mos, no obstante, que se necesitar\u00eda un impulso mayor para que este protocolo se extendiera a m\u00e1s hospitales, ya que se - g\u00fan los datos actuales 2 de cada 3 sepsis que se diagnostican en los hospitales son valorados en los SUH [16-18] y entre el 50-60% de los pacientes s\u00e9pticos o con shock s\u00e9ptico que in - gresan en las unidades de cr\u00edticos proceden del SUH [4]. Nuestros hallazgos ponen de relieve que el CS est\u00e1 m\u00e1s desarrollado en los SUH que en otros niveles asistenciales como la atenci\u00f3n pre-hospitalaria o en propio \u00e1mbito hos - pitalario, en el que no llegan al 50% de los casos seg\u00fan lo manifestado por los encuestados.

Se ha observado que los hospitales de mayor tama\u00f1o y que realizan m\u00e1s atenciones parecen tener una actitud m\u00e1s proactiva en el abordaje integral de los pacientes con sospe - cha de sepsis a tenor de los resultados obtenidos, hallazgo por otra parte esperable ya que disponen de m\u00e1s recursos, lo que comporta poder desarrollar m\u00e1s o mejores estrategias. Sin em-bargo, creemos que algunas de las implementaciones pueden resultar lo sucientemente simples como para que sean adop - tadas en cualquier SUH, independientemente del tama\u00f1o del centro o de su afluencia en Urgencias. M\u00e1s a\u00fan teniendo en cuenta que los hospitales de tama\u00f1o m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o dan soporte a m\u00e1s de la mitad de la poblaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola, por lo que no de-ber\u00edan ser excluidos de cualquier actuaci\u00f3n frente una enfer - medad tiempo-dependiente como la sepsis. Por otra parte, con la disponibilidad de las nuevas tecno - log\u00edas, creemos que la informatizaci\u00f3n del CS resulta de es - pecial inter\u00e9s. Sin embargo, solo el 47% de SUH respondieron disponer de un CS informatizado. En este sentido, disponer de herramientas de ayuda en la decisi\u00f3n como las calculadoras de escalas, sistemas de alerta o de antibioterapia han demos - trado resultados muy favorables. En un estudio de Ferreras et al. en Arag\u00f3n [23], la implementaci\u00f3n de un sistema de alar - mas autom\u00e1tico para la detecci\u00f3n precoz de los pacientes con sepsis grave obtuvo una reducci\u00f3n de mortalidad en t\u00e9rminos absolutos del 11,3% al ingreso y una mayor supervivencia a los 30 d\u00edas de forma signicativa, siendo el NNT de 8. Los autores concluyeron que la ausencia de sistemas de detecci\u00f3n auto - m\u00e1tica en urgencias implicaba un riesgo 2,02 veces mayor de muerte a los 30 d\u00edas que si se dispon\u00eda de este sistema. De forma paralela a esta baja informatizaci\u00f3n de los siste- mas, se observa el peque\u00f1o n\u00famero de hospitales que recogen los datos de cumplimiento de las medidas b\u00e1sicas iniciales ante la sospecha de un paciente con sepsis, lo que impide en gran medida tener una monitorizaci\u00f3n de las actuaciones que se es - t\u00e1n llevando a cabo, algo b\u00e1sico para detectar \u00e1reas de mejora y reconocer aquellas que se muestren realmente ecaces en el manejo de los pacientes [14,15,20]. Uno de los puntos clave en la actuaci\u00f3n en los pacientes con sepsis es el reconocimiento precoz en los servicios de ur-gencias y emergencias. En esta l\u00ednea, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os se han propuesto diferentes escalas para su identicaci\u00f3n. Ac - tualmente la gran mayor\u00eda de los hospitales que tienen un CS en el SUH detectan los pacientes s\u00e9pticos mediante las escalas SOFA o qSOFA, que podr\u00edamos catalogarlos como los est\u00e1nda-res actuales para la valoraci\u00f3n del deterioro de la funci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos entre los pacientes con sospecha de infecci\u00f3n. El uso de estas escalas ha aumentado de forma muy importante, ya que su uso exclusivo ha pasado de un 25% a un 63%, mientras que el uso combinado de estas dos escalas junto con el SIRS ha bajado del 50% al 30% en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os [4]. Parece claro que, a pesar de las limitaciones de estas escalas en t\u00e9rminos de sensibilidad y especicidad para la valoraci\u00f3n del paciente s\u00e9ptico en los SUH [24,25], su implantaci\u00f3n actual en los SUH espa\u00f1oles es indudable. Otro punto cr\u00edtico es el uso de los biomarcadores que se recomiendan para la valoraci\u00f3n inicial de los pacientes s\u00e9p - ticos. Es llamativo que el \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico no est\u00e9 disponible en el 100% de los hospitales consultados y no se use de forma rutinaria en el 13,2% de los SUH. En nuestra opini\u00f3n, se debe promover y favorecer el uso del \u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico, que juega un papel fundamental en la valoraci\u00f3n pron\u00f3stica de los pacien - tes s\u00e9pticos.

Otro biomarcador de infecci\u00f3n que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os ha tenido gran protagonismo en la valoraci\u00f3n diagn\u00f3stica de infecci\u00f3n bacteriana es la PCT [28]. Este biomar-cador respalda el diagn\u00f3stico de sepsis [14] y tiene un mejor rendimiento que la PCR [29]. Los resultados muestran que se utiliza en menor medida al no estar disponible en uno de cada 10 hospitales, lo que entendemos que es un punto de mejora a abordar. Otro de los aspectos analizados es la presencia de microbi\u00f3 - logo de guardia, lo que s\u00f3lo se produce en un tercio de los hos - pitales. Esta falta de servicio de microbiolog\u00eda las 24 horas o los festivos hace que no sea posible implantar t\u00e9cnicas espec\u00edcas de diagn\u00f3stico r\u00e1pido o bien la identicaci\u00f3n de hemocultivos Figura 1 Porcentaje de hospitales dentro de cada Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma en la que se han asumido los criterios diagn\u00f3sticos basados en el qSOFA/SOFA.

Esto podr\u00eda provo - car que, aunque la solicitud de hemocultivos se realice de forma correcta, s\u00f3lo se pueda obtener un adecuado rendimiento en horario de ma\u00f1ana en d\u00edas laborables y no de forma continuada [4]. Esto se acent\u00faa a\u00fan m\u00e1s en los hospitales peque\u00f1os. Por \u00faltimo, algo que se observa en la mayor\u00eda de los hos- pitales es que el CS puede ser activado tanto por los profesio - nales de medicina como de enfermer\u00eda, pero a\u00fan hay muchos hospitales en que la enfermer\u00eda no puede generar esta acti - vaci\u00f3n. Esto posiblemente necesite ser evaluado y revisado ya que en la mayor parte de los hospitales los profesionales de enfermer\u00eda son los que realizan el triaje inicial de los pacientes que acuden a Urgencias y es precisamente en esa parte de la valoraci\u00f3n inicial del paciente cuando es fundamental el reco-nocimiento y activaci\u00f3n de estos c\u00f3digos de patolog\u00edas tiem - po-dependientes como la sepsis [30]. Nuestro estudio presenta algunas limitaciones: 1) Los re - sultados se basan en la opini\u00f3n del responsable del SUH y no de sus profesionales, cuya opini\u00f3n no siempre resulta coinci - dente [31]; 2) Algunos aspectos encuestados no fueron va - lorados de forma cuantitativa sino cualitativamente, lo que pudiera comportar que las categor\u00edas cualitativas no fuesen equidistantes; 3) El reclutamiento no fue completo, pero la participaci\u00f3n pr\u00f3xima al 90% conlleva que los resultados obte-nidos sean ables y representativos de la asistencia a la sepsis en los SUH espa\u00f1oles. A pesar de estas limitaciones, el presente estudio ofrece una fotograf\u00eda de la realidad asistencial que los SUH proporcionan a los pacientes con sospecha de sepsis y con la informaci\u00f3n obtenida detectar aquellos aspectos en los que podemos incidir para mejorar el diagn\u00f3stico y manejo precoz de la sepsis, con el consiguiente benecio para los enfermos. En conclusi\u00f3n, pensamos que aunque se est\u00e1 avanzando en el desarrollo de protocolos espec\u00edcos para el tratamiento de la sepsis en los SUH, existe margen de mejora, sobre todo en los hospitales de menor tama\u00f1o. Creemos que la informatiza - ci\u00f3n y el desarrollo de alertas para el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento tienen a\u00fan un gran recorrido en los SUH. A\u00fan existiendo un protocolo nacional para el desarrollo del CS [13], opinamos que cada sistema sanitario tendr\u00eda que incidir en promover y crear protocolos propios basados en recomendaciones univer - sales aplicando al mismo las peculiaridades de cada sistema.

En este trabajo hemos escaneado el genoma del SARS-CoV-2 en busca de dianas terap\u00e9uticas. Encontramos una secuencia en el 5'UTR (NC \\ _045512: 74-130), que consis - te en un hept\u00e1mero t\u00edpico junto a una regi\u00f3n estructurada que puede causar cambios en la pauta de lectura. El valor biol\u00f3gico potencial de esta regi\u00f3n es relevante debido a su baja simili - tud con otros virus, incluidos los coronavirus relacionados con el SARS-CoV, y su alta conservaci\u00f3n de secuencia dentro de m\u00faltiples aislados de SARS-CoV-2. Hemos predicho la estruc-tura secundaria de la regi\u00f3n mediante diferentes herramientas bioinform\u00e1ticas. Hemos sugerido una estructura secundaria m\u00e1s probable para as\u00ed proceder al acoplamiento virtual en la estructura 3D para buscar un sitio de uni\u00f3n y luego ligandos de f\u00e1rmacos. Hemos encontrado varias mol\u00e9culas que proba-blemente podr\u00edan administrarse como f\u00e1rmacos orales mues-tran una anidad de uni\u00f3n prometedora dentro de la regi\u00f3n estructurada, por lo que es posible que intereran en su posible funci\u00f3n reguladora de la replicaci\u00f3n viral.

The aim of this work was to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome in search for therapeutic targets. We found a sequence in the 5'UTR (NC\\_045512:74-130), con - sisting of a typical heptamer next to a structured may cause ribosomal frameshifting. The potential biological value of this region with other viruses, including coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We have predicted the secondary structure of the region by means of different bioinformatic tools. We have suggested a most probable secondary structure to proceed with reconstruction segment. Finally, we carried out virtual docking on the 3D structure to look for a binding site and then for ligands from a promising binding afnity within the structured region, and so it Antiviral between is only one single nucleotide difference, a C to A substi - tution at position 13,533 bp. The frameshifting regions could be used as a target to ght viral infection [9]. Starting with early studies, point mu - tations at the slippery sequence have proved to have an im - portant effect on viral replication [8]; thus, they can interesting points in the engineering of an attenuated virus for vaccine development. The inhibition of these regions by pep - tide antisense oligomers was studied overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b this work, we scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome to seek for novel likely critical areas for virus replication focusing on frameshifting predictors. We explored the likely biological rele-vance of this feature through the study of sequence conserva - tion and its suitability as a potential drug target by the analysis of the structural drug docking prediction of the relevant and structures in the genome for SARS-CoV-2 (NC 045512) was the tool [14]. The output determined the se - quence position of slippery sequences and nearby pseudo since both criteria are needed to predict frameshifting. Our focus on a region was established by combining KnotInFrame output and the likely regulatory roles of regions. Once a sequence of interest these inspection of the bracket was chosen from the inspection of the overall of the 5'UTR and assuring to include the The likelihood of the secondary structure was assessed by computing the mini - mum free energy (MFE) of a large number of random sequenc-es of SARS-CoV-2 of the same length as the sequence of in - terest into mFold, in order to obtain an empirical distribution of was Middle outbreak in Those three zo- onotic so they may spill over from a host species to a different one through small changes in their genome. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a high genetic similarity (more than 85%) a virus group known as SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), which are use frameshift-ing (1 PRF) to direct the synthesis - teins that prepare the infected cell for takeover by the virus. Frameshifting is a smart mechanism for the translation of a genomic sequence into two different proteins by moving the translation frame one position in the union between RNA and the ribosome [4]. A typical frameshifting signal has two a characteristic heptanucleotide called the 'slip - pery' sequence, at which the ribosome-bound tRNAs slip into the -1 frame, and upon the base-pairing of a single-stranded region of RNA in the loop of a hairpin to a stretch of comple - mentary nucleotides elsewhere in the RNA chain. A set of bioinformatic tools has already been developed to predict these The completely some authors to the helicase activity of the - the ribosome is able to switch from the zero reading frame to the 1 frame and translation continues in the new frame.

First, the conservation between SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal hosted coronavirus genomes was studied by the computation of a cladogram and by the search for the alignment of the sequence of interest against a com - prehensive viral database. A total of 21 high quality genomes from coronavirus hosted in a cladogram. The genomes were down - loaded from GenBank and aligned with Clustal Omega [18] using the The ggtree [20] was used in R [21] to generate the graphic of the cladogram and the multiple sequence alignment (MSA). In addition to this alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 and another 20 coronavirus ge - nomes, the sequence of interest was examined tool with a com - prehensive database of all types of virus, so that we would as - sess any casual homology with any other virus. Secondly, we evaluated the conservation of the sequence of interest within SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geographic locations since the onset of the pandemic. We took advantage of the fast con - tribution genomes into the GISAID database.

The results of the predicted 3D structure and possible a drug binding site are shown in Figure 5. The volume of the binding site is the result of the exploration with Autodock tools. The coordinates of the binding site were obtained in .pdb format and they were passed into Autodock Vina (the exhaustiveness search parameter at a default value of eight; and the random seed sequence was xed) [25]. The results of the docking by Autodock Vina against lead com - pounds from the NCBI Maximum Diversity set are Table compounds value.

DISCUSSION This in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, likely a biological role on account of the remarkable conservation of its sequence and stability of the structure. The close occurrence of the slip - pery sequence and a likely stable pseudoknot suggests that this may be an area of frameshifting, in addition to the previous - ly described overlapping of pres-ent in SARS-CoV-2 [9]. focused on a different region, pre - viously unnoticed in the 5'UTR. The fact that no protein may be linked with the sequence may argue against frameshifting, as may that of the overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b. Supporting the role of 5'UTR, Zhu et al. [28] demonstrated that different natural deletions in the has been described in HIV-1 [29], and in this case the structure next to the slippery sequence is a stem and loop, without additional pseudoknotting. Another important endeavour of this work is to consider this RNA structured area as a al. Rev Esp Quimioter in in SARS-CoV did not progress to an actual drug for use in health care [12,30], probably due to the lag in time of this discovery after the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak.

In Ta - ble 2 (eighth row) of their article, they describe, among others, sequence 40:157 of NC\\_045512-2 as highly conserved and structured. We reproduce in Figure 1 their proposal of struc-ture for our region of interest. The result of the alignment of our sequence of interest against the Viroblast database showed that the sequence may have been close to SARS-CoV as de - scribed in 2003 [31]. We found pathways of sequences; coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2. outside this the of bats as intermediate hosts between and relevant with the sequence which we describe. A limitation of our work is that it was restricted to compu - tational analysis.

NSC61610 was given orally, once a day to mice in an experimental model of H1N1 influenza infection [32]. The mice had response was better than with tamiflu after the sixth day of infection. However, that mechanism of action is unrelated to interactions with viral RNA, as NSC61610 acts as a modulator of the immune response. In we have identied a relevant the 5'UTR region of SARS-CoV-2. It displays traits which sequence. Our analysis of the drug susceptibility of this sequence is hindered by the inconsistent predictions of bioin-formatic tools.

Estudio observacional prospectivo en atenci\u00f3n primaria RESUMEN Objetivos. Evaluar el consumo de antibi\u00f3ticos entre los pacientes a los que se les efectu\u00f3 una prescripci\u00f3n antibi\u00f3tica diferida y compararlo con el consumo observado en una revi - si\u00f3n no sistem\u00e1tica de estudios de prescripci\u00f3n diferida. M\u00e9todos. Estudio observacional en tres centros de salud desde septiembre 2018 hasta marzo 2020. Se realiz\u00f3 un se - guimiento de los registros electr\u00f3nicos de los 82 pacientes con episodios de bronquitis aguda y 44 faringitis aguda a los que se les entreg\u00f3 una prescripci\u00f3n diferida para evaluar si fue a la farmacia a buscarla y cu\u00e1ndo la obtuvo. Resultados. No fueron a buscar la medicaci\u00f3n en 50 ca - sos (39,7%), pero cinco pacientes tomaron otro antibi\u00f3tico en las dos primeras semanas. De los 76 pacientes que recogieron la prescripci\u00f3n, solo 12 la obtuvieron seg\u00fan las instrucciones de sus m\u00e9dicos (15,8%). Conclusiones. La estrategia de prescripci\u00f3n diferida redu- ce el consumo de antibi\u00f3ticos, pero esta reducci\u00f3n es menor que la que se observa en ensayos cl\u00ednicos, siendo comparable con los resultados observados en otros estudios observaciona-les sobre prescripci\u00f3n diferida.

Infecciones por Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum y VIH son las m\u00e1s relevantes en cuanto a esterilidad, pero queda menos claro el rol que desempe\u00f1an otros microor - ganismos [1,2]. En las cervicitis se reduce la posibilidad de concepci\u00f3n espont\u00e1nea [3] pero se considera al factor cervi - cal una causa inusual de esterilidad y soslayan su importancia mediante \"inseminaci\u00f3n uterina\" o \"fecundaci\u00f3n in-vitro\" (FIV) Tambi\u00e9n se ha demostrado una reducci\u00f3n en la tasa de reci\u00e9n nacido vivo mediante FIV en los casos con sangre en el cat\u00e9ter de transferencia embrionaria por una cervicitis cl\u00ednica inadver - tida [4]. Streptococcus pneumoniae coloniza el tracto respi-ratorio superior y de forma transitoria puede formar parte de la microbiota comensal del tracto genital femenino, pudiendo producir en raros casos infecciones cervicales y p\u00e9lvicas, espe - cialmente si existen factores predisponentes [5].

S. pneumoniae no forma parte de la microbiota vaginal habitual y su aislamiento en exudados vaginal/cervical se da en menos del 1% de las mujeres [5]. Sin embargo, S. pneumo- niae puede acceder a la mucosa vaginal por contaminaci\u00f3n de las manos o por pr\u00e1ctica sexual orogenital o v\u00eda hemat\u00f3gena, como se ha descrito con otras especies [7]. Entre los factores de riesgo para colonizaci\u00f3n del tracto genital se encuentran el uso de dispositivos intrauterinos, periodo posparto o posaborto o cirug\u00eda ginecol\u00f3gica reciente [8]. Ninguna de estas circuns - tancias concurr\u00eda en el caso expuesto. Consideramos que la cervicitis provocada por este microorganismo podr\u00eda estar con - tribuyendo a un descenso en la fertilidad natural de la pareja, as\u00ed como a un fracaso tras transferencia embrionaria. Se des - conoce la patogenia de la obstrucci\u00f3n tub\u00e1rica de la paciente, que no reconoc\u00eda haber padecido previamente ning\u00fan episodio cl\u00ednico compatible con enfermedad p\u00e9lvica inflamatoria. Ade - m\u00e1s, desconocemos si estaba vacunada frente al neumococo, aunque manifest\u00f3 haber realizado correctamente la vacuna - ci\u00f3n durante su etapa infantil. Sin embargo, dada la edad de la paciente en el momento del estudio y al no estar incluida en ning\u00fan grupo de riesgo, lo m\u00e1s probable es que no estuviese vacunada dado que esta vacuna se incluy\u00f3 en calendario va-cunal universal bastante m\u00e1s tarde. Finalmente, no se han pu - blicados episodios de aislamientos de neumococo en exudado cervical de pacientes est\u00e9riles, ni evidencias que lo justiquen. En conclusi\u00f3n, los estudios microbiol\u00f3gicos del aparato genital deber\u00edan ser amplios, no limit\u00e1ndose a poblaciones de riesgo y empleando pruebas que permitan la detecci\u00f3n de pa-t\u00f3genos estrictos y oportunistas, ya que de forma indirecta se reduce el riesgo de infertilidad de origen infeccioso.
