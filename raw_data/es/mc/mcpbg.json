This study investigated the relationship between different teaching models (online and offline) and the development of cognitive skills in clinical medicine METHODS: 2018 in offline teaching at Xiangya School of Medicine, South University.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that online teaching not statistically significantly different [Identifying academic motivation profiles relation to formal construct of the of AMS in itself is not fully consistent with the SDT theory as only scores of the subscales can be calculated resulting in seven different score means instead of positioning the individual on the self-determination continuum.

This group was compared to students who had attended a week-long practical block with a somatic focus during the same time period (control group). Stigmatization was measured before and immediately upon completion of the week using the MICA-4 scale. Data on age, sex, experience with the mentally ill, interest in psychiatry/psychosomatics, and sense of self-worth were also gathered prior to starting the practical block. Analysis of the sample of 143 students with a complete basic data set was carried out using mixed ANOVA, multiple linear in the intervention group compared to the students in the ill general in the subjects of psychiatry or psychosomatics at with lower stigma. In contrast, stigmatization was increased at the beginning of the study in males and those with low self-esteem.

However, receiving feedback from the supervisor evokes emotions and accepting it is not easy. Several recommendations guide preceptors on how to share feedback with and all the importance of positive effect of informing and training learners about feedback, few focus on their responsiveness to feedback. Under the rubric of developing a personal skill to better accept feedback, we propose a new behavioral model, called H.O.S.T., which aims to guide learners to approach feedback with a personal growth mindset associated with the learning position. Specifically, the model presents an interdependent set of attitudes and behaviors that aim to facilitate emotional management and engagement in the feedback process, in order to initiate the reflective process necessary and justified by theoretical concepts. In order to better assimilate the components of the model, the use of internal dialogue is adopted to facilitate the training and adoption of behaviors. The essence of the model is discussed in light the literacy Mental Health App for Undergraduate and Medical Students during Health); 20(13)2023 Jun 30. RESUMEN OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the implementation of a mental health app designed for undergraduate and medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Medical (n = 270) and undergraduate students (n = 1386) from five universities in the Appalachian region in the United States participated in this study. METHODS: Universities from the United States were recruited to deploy the Sharpen app for pages, had a compared to 100% of the universities that were recruited participated in the study. IMPLEMENTATION: Five out of six implementation criteria were included, continued using Sharpen app following the end of data collection, resulting in a 100% maintenance rate. CONCLUSIONS: The RE-AIM framework indicated usability and maintenance and undergraduate Future research needs to implement a more rigorous design to determine the impact of the Sharpen app on mental health from physicians and medical students to the Need for Change: A Constructivist Grounded Theory of Medical Students' Understanding of Health.](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-37397423) [Health teaching in psychiatry has had a passing focus on human rights. Against this backdrop, the aim of this study was to construct a theory of the learning value of a service user-led human rights-focused rights following teaching program. The overarching theory that emerged focuses on an awareness of the need for change within student learning. This involves both a need for understanding the mental health care system and a need for self-reflection. These two processes appear to interact, promoting learning about the value of a human rights focus. While acknowledging the difficulties in securing such doing so would be valuable to the practice of mental health. This service user-led human rights teaching program produced new awareness in medical students, both in terms of their understanding of their own biases and in of understanding influence of systemic structural elements the psychiatric system on the protection of service users' human rights. Teaching human rights in psychiatry is likely to enrich their These challenges have a negative impact in medical practice, leading to uncompassionate care.

Methods: In May and June 2020, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 21 students (in the 8th and 9th semester) at the Medical Faculty of the University of Ulm. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by virology, placed on them. More emphasis was placed on their roles as scientific or medical advisors and as helpers in the health care system, a change that was sometimes emotionally stressful. With respect to the study objective, both and supporting factors were named. For example, the clarification of the relevance of the medical professional was motivating. The that context, studies The perception of changed expectations may also play a of the findings may be to address such dynamics in suitable curricular events and discuss them professional identity formation in health practice.
