Please allow me to stress the two aspects which I consider to have been of greatest importance in our work over these last twelve months. On one hand, our scientific results are yet again excellent, thanks to you all. We are keeping up our level of production and quality in both publications and projects and we have also got some very good results as CIBERES in competitive calls. One good example of this could be the fact that in 2016 we were granted four of the nine applications for FIS projects presented by us, which represents double the results obtained in 2015, as well as a type I Miguel Servet contract, the only one granted to a CIBER area in this call. I would secondly like to highlight the work that we have done in developing a Strategic Plan to steer our work until 2019. This Plan redefines both our mission and vision and our strategic objectives, which can now finally be expressed as follows: CIBERES excellence research and innovation safe transfer to clinical practice, encouraging training and compiling knowledge and research talent state-wide, as a driving-force research centre and field of respiratory diseases. CIBERES Vision: CIBERES vision is to be an excellence network research centre on the international level, competitive, sustainable and a reference in the work done for prevention in the field of respiratory participation and leadership of research work. Transfer of results in innovation: promoting the transfer of research results to society in general and to the production sector in particular. Training: reinforcing the skills its activities and main results of respiratory research to society. Ferran Barb\u00e9, Scientific Director 44 Cooperation and alliances: establishing relations and stable synergies with public and private agents in the field of respiratory medicine. Our work over the coming years will thus be focussed on attaining the objectives set, to which end I hope to go on relying on your backing. Congratulations to you all for your excellent work and for your commitment to cooperative research. Many thanks. 5 Organisation26661231236Organisational structure The CIBERES is one of the thematic areas forming the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red (CIBER), a Spanish research consortium in the field of biomedical research with great scientific potential, under the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) - Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness. In 2016 it was made up of 8 thematic areas, which were extended to 11 in 2017. The CIBERES is made up of 32 research groups, belonging to institutions of many different kinds: university hospitals, universities, Public Research Organizations (OPI), such as the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) itself and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC), and research centres of Spain's regional 'autonomous communities' . CIBERES has a large team of human resources consisting of over 400 people, including a sizeable staff of its own researchers and members of groups as personnel associated to the CIBERES. This extensive team is made up of basic and clinical biomedical researchers, research technicians and management staff. As a thematic area of the CIBER, the CIBERES belongs to this public consortium and is thus governed by a Governing Body and a Permanent Committee (its governing and management bodies) in which the institutions in the consortium take part. The organisational structure is made up of the Scientific Management, under Dr Ferr\u00e1n Barb\u00e9, which along with the Management Committee coordinates the work done by the three Scientific Programmes into which CIBERES groups are split. The CIBER Technical Unit provides the administrative support required for run. Steering Committe Members The Management Committee is presided over by the Scientific Director and made up of the coordinators of the programmes and manager of the CIBER. name Post ferran Barb\u00e9 ill\u00e1 Scientific Director Jes\u00fas ruiz-cabello osuna Scientific Assistant Director t orres mart\u00ed Coordinator of the Infectious Disease Programme Coordinator of Teaching Programme Javier Mu\u00f1oz Bravo Management of Scientific Programmes roser m\u00edas carballal Attached to Scientific Director manuel Advisory Scientific Committee The External Advisory Scientific Committee is a body for scientific assessment and support, made up of relevant personalities in the field of health sciences standing out for their professional or scientific careers in line with the objectives of the Consortium.

Impact of EU Proyecto M+VISION. Transfer One of the CIBER's main aims is the transfer of the knowledge generated by its researchers, so that its research results can be developed in protocols, services and products for improving clinical practice and people's quality of life. To this end the CIBER Technology Transfer department acts as a liaison between our researchers and companies, private institutions, public research centres and other innovation agents to make cooperation with them more effective and ensure that the results of research are actually applied. Work is done in several approaches to achieve this aim: Continuous contact with our researchers to monitor their results and train them in innovation management. On 29 and 30 November 2016 a Technology Transfer Session was arranged to this end as part of the 30th anniversary of the ISCIII. At this event experts in different areas shared their knowledge on industrial property, company creation, licencing processes, venture capital, grants for internationalisation, etc. Protection of the results of research and management of cooperation with other agents, as displayed by the other agreements.1111RES11 eleven applications and a registration of software were thus submitted at the CIBER. Seven inventions are in the patentability study and one in the drafting stage, and these are expected to be submitted in early 2017. Apart quarter 2017. At CIBERES a licence contract was signed with a company in 2016. The presentation of the results of research and technological capacities of our groups in technology transfer sessions. Among many other measures, and just as an example of this, CIBER had a stand and institutional presence at BIOSPAIN 2016 (28-30 September, Bilbao). Support for company Other As an example we could mention: - The call for Caixaimpulse 2016 projects at which a CIBERES project won an award.- Several MTAs (material transfer agreements) were signed, one with a company and thus with compensation Communication Department performed different measures for dissemination and disclosure in order to raise awareness of the Centre, as well as to spread knowledge about the research work done by the groups in its eight thematic areas. The main highlights of the Communication work done by CIBERES in 2016 are as follows: The CIBERES in the media: In this period 67 CIBER press releases were published, 4 of these from the CIBERES and 1 in cooperation between several CIBER areas.

To the mobility research researchers' intensification measures to enable the presentation of Training Programme for Research Staff GRANTS FOR INITIATION TO RESEARCH This programme proved to be of great interest as in earlier editions. The aim of the grants is to help young researchers in their initial training to join a research programme financed by public institutions for one year and associate this with one of the CIBERES research groups. The official Programme for training research staff (FPI) keeps its co-financing ratio at 66% by the teaching training programme and 33% by the receiving group itself. Thanks to the increase in the further calls for 9 grants were launched in 2016. Improvement and Mobility Programme In 2016, a further line of action was added to the mobility programme focussing on co-financing the enrolment for payment of dues (500 \u20ac per application) and 3 applications for stays in another city were co-financed. Longer stays were encouraged with an increase in the economic endowment of the grants to 600 \u20ac per month plus 80% of the return trip, approving a further 2 applications (London and Toronto), which will be financed in 2017. Intensification Programme proposals for European/international projects. The final aim of this is to increase the input of external resources by raising the number of projects financed. 2 applications were presented in 2016. Programme for Fostering Interest in Respiratory Research TRAINING SESSIONS On 29 and 30 September 2016 the 9th Training Sessions were held in Madrid, at the Sala Auditorio of the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). One innovation that we should mention was the participation CIBERBBN who shared the presentation of 6 and CIBER-BBN researchers took part, presenting 10 oral 38 as well as the value contributed by senior researchers and managers. 3 prizes for the best posters and oral communication were awarded as well as a special \"Dr. Constancio highly-considered oral paper.2525RES25 Transversal programmesInternationalisation Programme Coordinator: Cristina Rodr\u00edguez Last May 2015 the CIBER Platform for Assistance for Internationalisation was set up. The Platform for Assistance for Internationalisation (PAI) came about as a joint initiative of the Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Diseases (CIBERES), of the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red (CIBER), with the aim of underpinning and internationalisation leadership of research and innovation in these three thematic areas. In 2016 the platform focussed its work on two main areas: fostering the participation of CIBER groups in international projects and improving the international visibility of the CIBER. As regards fostering the participation of CIBER groups in international projects and, in order to improve the quality of the proposals put forward, the PAI has carried out 4 specific events for the relevance cooperation proposals in the framework of H2020\" (Madrid edition. June 2016, with 40 attending, and Barcelona edition, September 2016, 44 attending) both a great success for all those taking part. In order to raise the quality of the proposals and improve returns the PAI got under way a Service for editing proposals which has carried out and positioning of proposals (contrasting the scientific idea with that of the call and issuing a grounded report with recommendations on how to adapt the idea, need for strategic partners, etc...) the PAI has received over 27 enquiries in this respect. 2) Edition of proposals (PAI has edited over 20 proposals). 3) Evaluation of results (in previous proposals or sent the giving a grounded criticism of the result and proposing where there is room for improvement (12 requests in the period). 3) Search for strategic partners (6 requests in this period, plus 6 external partners who got in touch with CIBER to propose joint cooperation). Thanks to this, in 2016 CIBER put forward 36 new proposals, 4 new projects being granted. Expressions of interest were received for the presentation of 10 new proposals. In this field it should be stressed that CIBER has received 5 new contacts from research groups or companies in order to set up agreements for joint presentation of proposals in the H2020 setting, and currently 2 of these contacts have materialised in the real presentation of two H2020 proposals. In the field of the CIBER'S international visibility, the CIBER has done some intensive work by attending over 18 events (including informative sessions, and placed special stress on establishing a smooth relationship with the different national representatives, national points of contact, by means of specific meetings, acting as a point of contact on the institutional level. In order to improve international presence, specific meetings were held with NCPs and with the head H2020 programme in order to in communication, CIBER was invited to the Forum for strategic definition of the Wp2018-2020 and took an active part in defining the 2017 work programmes and IMI calls as also decided to include postulating CIBER for participation in joint measures JA-01, 02, 03, 04, 05-2016 in which it was offered the possibility to take part in measures as associated centres.

Furthermore, the first of the 'omics' analysis from the CIBERES project BIOMEPOC has been carried out. This is one of the main studies of the program on Chronic Respiratory Diseases (COPD line), and has facilitated the extension of our collaborations to bioinformatic groups from other research institutions. There are also collaborations with groups of CIBER BBN, which are focused on the development of instruments to monitor respiratory muscle function. Regarding translational activities have two patented instruments that are currently commercialized (Europe and America). On the other hand, in the past year we participated in the elaboration and publication of the SEPAR recommendations for the management of lung cancer patients, and in a guide for the study of autophagy. An important and recent addition to the group has been our second CIBER postdoctoral investigator, an action that will undoubtedly boost our future research actions. In terms of projects, two actions were submitted to the EC 2020 Horizon program and both have been positively evaluated in the initial thematic selection. One of be CIBERES.

The first one, started in 2013 and whose researcher is Javier Milara, is entitled: Study of the Janus Kinasa 2 / STAT3 route as a pharmacological project The of whose investigator in charge is Julio Cortijo was initiated in and your title is: New anti-inflammatory drugs in COPD and asthma. Study in models of in vitro corticoresistencia financed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and finally the last one initiate also in 2015 and whose responsible investigator is vitro models in COPD financed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness.On the other hand during this year also has participated in projects of private financing. The first one was based on the differential COPD financed by Gr\u00fcnenthal GmbH. In the second, Clearance on primary currently to the projects mentioned, the group has participated in events of scientific diffusion among them in the congress of the European Respiratory Society and two doctoral theses have been presented as well as 4 end-of-degree / master's degrees. 75 research groups Staff members: Ojanguren \u00cd\u00f1igo Associated members: \u00c1lvarez Fern\u00e1ndez, Antonio | Bravo Masgoret, Carlos | Cruz Carmona, M\u00aa Jes\u00fas | De Gracia Rold\u00e1n, Javier | Ferrer Sancho, Jaime | Genover Llimona, M\u00aa Teresa | G\u00f3mez Olles, Susana | Lloberes Canadell, Patricia | Mart\u00ed Beltr\u00e1n, Sergi | Monforte Torres, V\u00edctor | Mravitilles Fern\u00e1ndez, Marc | Orriols Mart\u00ednez, Ram\u00f3n | Roca Gas, Oriol | Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez, Esther | Rom\u00e1n Broto, Antonio | Romero Santo Tom\u00e1s, Odile | Ruano Burgos, Laura | Sampol Rubio, Gabriel | Untoria Corral, M\u00aa Dolores | Venrell Belat, Montserrat Main lines of research The activity of basic and clinical research of the group focuses mainly in areas of inflammation and repair, respiratory failure and tissue hypoxia, and there is complementarity and interrelation of these areas for the study research in asthma the group is working in the MEGA project aimed at increasing knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of asthma as well as to study the parameters that can determine long-term changes in the patient's condition treatments that can influence the progression of the disease. In short, the group aims to better understand the natural history of disease in order to reduce its incidence. We believe that the key to a better understanding of asthma is to carry out an integrated approach, in which genetic and factors relevant characteristics the disease are analyzed. In the line of pulmonary fibrosis, our studies have shown that it is possible to determine the causes of this disease in half of the cases after the completion of a clinical study in depth. The group has shown that a major cause of idiopathic pulmonary to disease called hypersensitivity pneumonitis cr\u00f3nica. In this research the group has a murine model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis that will be significant in the near future to see the effect of different treatments as well as to study the pathophysiological pathways of this disease. Our center is currently one of the 7 hospitals in the country where lung transplants are performed and one of the most active in this field, which places it in one of the top European and world level. With the unique opportunity generated by the lung transplant program at our hospital, the group is actively working on the inclusion of samples in the CIBERES biobank. fundaci\u00f3n hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron - Institut de Recerca (VHIR) Hospital Vall d'Hebron Passeig Vall d'Hebron, 119-129 08035 Barcelona (+34) 93 Halpin D., Cardoso J., Chuchalin A.G. et al .
