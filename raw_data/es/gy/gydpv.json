A better understanding of HIV and HCV evolutionary dynamics would enable the design of strategies, bearing in mind the high mutation rates. Our group is developing a strategy based on a new technology called virus engineering (SAVE), which recodes and the viral genome while maintaining the amino-acid sequence present in the wild-type and al, Trends in Microbiology, 2016). Deoptimization of different moieties of the HIV-1 gag and pol genes has enabled the development of variants of HIV-1 with The study of viruses is a pioneering endeavour in the new research field of synonymous genome recoding and, together to interesting basic biology the development of novel therapies. Despite great progress in research into the virus phenotype. 2017 milestones and perspectives the studying the stability of attenuated viruses and obtaining a new attenuated virus by deoptimizing other viral genes. Recoding has been done by introducing different codon pairs in the gag have the same amino-acid sequence as the wild-type virus but have different arrangements of synonymous these viruses have an attenuated phenotype depends, on the one hand, on the presence of mutations in certain gag, pol or env regions or because of their effect on the translation of the corresponding messenger \u2014 and on the other hand, on base pair content (e.g., the presence of CpG and/or TPA). An important issue is production HIV-1 infected cells) synthetic DNA (produced by chemical synthesis or PCR) in the absence of infectious virus clones. We have produced infectious virus from one or more DNA fragments (up to six fragments have stability of the variants is associated with the loss of replicative capacity and, more importantly, with the number of mutations introduced, which, in biological individual clones (viral quasispecies) has yielded information on the sequence space explored by different viral variants. An unexplored aspect of HIV-1 influences the diversity and capacity whether the HIV-1 genome sequences in the amino-acid sequences but also in the viral RNA sequences. We have explored whether viruses recoded in the pol region \u2014 with 13% of synonymous mutations that alter codon pair usage but not viral wild-type viruses. Our results show that viruses recoded in the region show a pattern of resistance to protease inhibitors that is different from that of the wild-type virus (Nevot et al 2017, in press). Our results confirm that the virus recoded in their use of codon pairs occupy a sequence space that is different from that of the wild-type virus. Note that even though the recoded viruses show different patterns of resistance, their phenotypic resistance is similar to that of the wild-type virus, suggesting that the recoded virus is, in mutation equally as robust as the wild-type virus. These results have been reported in the first published study on the evolutionary capacity of an enzyme recoded in its codons. We have explored the impact of of synonymous codons in terms of an ability to both express the Env viral protein and to replicate the virus. The six env-HIV-1 gene codons AGG, GAG, CCT, ACT, CTC and GGG were synonymously changed to CGT, GAA, CCG, use. was that mutations in Env 3 coding region can induce lethality.

It is, therefore: \u2014 the viral factor that determines virus spread and the target protein for \u2014 the resulting chronic inflammation. These two aspects of the viral envelope have shaped our activity in recent years. We significant efforts humoral and producing synthetic antibodies have through analysis of different cohorts of HIV-infected patients, whom group also developed new tools for analysing these data (OurFlow software). The ultimate goal of our research is to develop vaccines that protect against infected individuals. 2017 milestones and perspectives for the future Vaccine development In 2017 we patented the invention of new VLPs for the development of vaccines (patent EP1638234.4). These VLPs, based on the fusion of the Gag viral protein, are a potentially excellent platform for the development of new vaccines against HIV and other pathogens. The new patent reflects potential applications to different viral or bacterial infectious diseases and to oncology. The development of these applications was assisted by the recruitment of isolated from individuals. collaborations with other institutions (BSC) have been order to develop the in The development of recombinant antibodies ongoing of the spin-off activity continues in with HIV During 2017, with active assistance of V\u00edctor further developed the OurFlow (project rapidly analysing complex immunological data (multicolour flow cytometry).

IrsiCaixa 2017 Annual Report | 27 Presentation The group focuses its activities on three main research lines: HIV pathogenesis in lymphoid tissue HIV infection loss of the mucosa, (GALT), and destruction of CD4 T-cells in peripheral blood, a high degree of immunological activation and massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The mechanisms observed in peripheral blood, is a current topic of debate. This difference between blood and tissue has highlighted the importance of assessing the effect of both the virus and antiretroviral therapy on lymphoid tissue, as this is where latent viral infection (the viral reservoir) is established. Therefore, studies in this area can contribute to achieving total eradication of the virus. Our group evaluates viral pathogenic effects (for HIV and SIV) and the of antiretroviral drugs on the tissue HIV-positive individuals different levels of viral and/or immune control as well as in ex vivo models of healthy donor tissue. Functional evaluation of the immune system of individuals with poor immune recovery Massive destruction in GALT is one of the possible causes of poor immune recovery after antiretroviral treatment, observed 15%-30% of people infected with HIV. present maturation is functional characterization of the immune system of these studying the role played by CMV prevalent cancers in the world.

From Microbes to Medicines \u2014 initiative of Biocat and \"la Caixa\" Banking Foundation), led by IrsiCaixa and held in CosmoCaixa \u2014 showcased works that exemplified how the microbiota is becoming an essential part of modern medicine. Microbiome and HIV Nichole Klatt from the University of Washington presented data from a study he had published in Science on vaginal dysbiosis, i.e., the change from a physiological vaginal flora predominated by Lactobacillus spp . to a flora with an abundance of other species such as Gardnerella spp. or Prevotella was then not available to block HIV-1 entry. This is the first evidence that the microbiota can influence HIV- 1 transmission. The study launches an area for research into the role played by microbes in the drug metabolism that will acquire great importance in the coming years. Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez-Real from the University of Girona presented results of recent work demonstrating that the drug most commonly used to treat adult diabetes \u2014 is to modify the gut microbiota so as to favour bacteria more capable of metabolizing sugars in the diet.
