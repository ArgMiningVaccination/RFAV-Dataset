Burns remain a major cause of traumatic injury world-wide burns include male gender, extreme youth or old age, alcohol abuse, and substandard housing residence. In the last half century a best understanding of the principles of care burn have infection with advanced life support capability and secondary transfer to a Burn Unit have improve substantially survival of severe burns patients. as thermal injury-induced lesions which justify Society of Anesthesiologists. The efficiency of the initial chain of medical care is essential improving outcome, specifically in severe understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms involved in burn shock. Major burns cause massive tissue destruction and result in activation of effects distant The systemic effects occur in two distinct phases, a followed by phase. continued loss of plasma into burned tissue can occur up to the first 48h or even longer. Loss of intravascular fluid into can quickly the initial inflammatory responses. This an in microvascular in both, correction of leading to a further ischemic collagen fibers in the interstitium, causing a physical expansion of the potential third space with a transient 20 gradient upper airway after facial, neck or upper thoracic burn and after inhalation is and clear mediators. The mediators to produce this capillary integrity disruption is not The implicated renin angiotensin systems in this response. The classic description of the burn wound and surrounding tissues is a burned tissues, with a zone of coagulation, a nonviable area of tissue at the epicenter of the burn, a zone of ischemia or stasis surrounding tissues (both deep and peripheral) to the coagulated areas, which are not devitalized initially but, due to microvascular insult, can progress necrosis over several days resuscitated thermally The tissues by proper resuscitation in the initial stages. Underresuscitation can convert this area into deep dermal or full-thickness burns in areas not initially injured to that extent. A new area of interest with immediate resuscitation is the use of subatmospheric pressure dressings (e.g., the VAC) on affected areas. Animal models and early clinical work suggest that this treatment may limit the conversion of zones of hyperemia to by Without effective and rapid intervention all severe burns suffer burn shock. Burn shock is a unique combination of distributive and hypovolemic and often treating these burns an The probably importance in reducing both the local burn important step in reducing morbidity and mortality. The American Burn Association (ABA) has established recommended criteria for transfer to burn centers. These factors that are associated with poorer outcomes, such as advanced electrical ( [Table 2](#tbl0010)). Criteria for referral to a Burn Unit.

Every second is precious and the quicker the first aid is provided the minimal is the extent of damage. [10](#bib0265) the skin and irrigation with copious amounts of water, taking care not to spread chemical on burns to adjacent unburned areas. Irrigation with water should the the hospital. Efforts to neutralize chemicals are contraindicated due to the additional generation of heat, which would further contribute to tissue damage. A rescuer must be careful not to come in contact with the chemical, i.e., gloves, eye protectors, etc., should be worn. Removal of a victim from an electrical current is best accomplished by turning off the current and by using a nonconductor to separate the victim from the source. [3](#bib0230) After extrication, initial care of burn victim is the basic principles of any trauma ABCDE's (Advanced Trauma Life Support Paramedics, as alcohol or drugs and associated should be obtained, if possible (allergies, It rapid made as to whether the airway is compromised or is at risk of compromise. [11](#bib0270) In airway assessment, care provider (i.e., carbonaceous sputum, singed facial or burns, oropharyngeal edema, vocal changes or altered mental status). If one or more of the signs of inhalation are present, administration humidified oxygen via a nonrebreathing be placed and administrated 100% oxygen. Inhalation hot gases will result in burn above vocal cords. This burn will hours, especially after fluid resuscitation begun. If there is any concern about the patency of the airway clinical evidence of respiratory failure, major inhalation injury or massive facial swelling or unconsciousness. Even then, in our experience when burn size exceeds 50% TBSA of it should not be undertaken routinely simply because there are facial burns. [2](#bib0225) Flash the face but rarely airway, unlike in a closed space, shock. [14](#bib0285) All patients should be assessed Considerer or hypovolaemia and trauma associated. [15](#bib0290) There is consensus in the recommendation that after a burn injury happens, [16](#bib0295) for is consensus about the time of effectiveness of this procedure after the injury. Some authors state that cool running water only has beneficial effects during the first hour [17](#bib0300) while is still until 3h, limiting tissue injury. When the burn lesion covers more than 10% of TBSA we must monitor the patient because of the risk of hypothermia, and warm him up if necessary. [18](#bib0305) keep [16](#bib0295) Neither direct application of ice, because it can cause new injuries, nor cold-water application is advised, as there is a risk of hypothermia. For emergency treatment or initial treatment at the place of injury, it is recommended to cover the wounds, assess to first wound care is performed during admission to the burn unit and management of the wound should be performed. Full history Wallace's \"rule of nine\" is a useful guide. is such that anatomical regions represent 9% of neck and each arm, 9%; anterior trunk, posterior trunk and each leg, 18%. In children, the relative body surface area of the head and neck is larger, and that of the lower extremities smaller in A more precise age-adjusted estimate of relative body surface area in children can be made using the Lund and Browder. A useful adjunct for calculating the size of partially burned areas of skin is the palm of the patient's hand which represents 0.5% of TBSA. Assessing burn depth be to Burns are classified into two groups by the amount of skin loss. Partial thickness burns do not extend through all skin layers, whereas full thickness burns extend through all skin layers into the subcutaneous tissues. Partial thickness can be divided epidermis), superficial dermal (burns extends through the epidermis into the upper layers) and deep dermal (burns extends through the epidermis into the deeper layers of the dermis but not through the entire dermis). The degree of burns is calculated to estimate the prognosis, the amount of intravenous fluids (second and third degree) as well as the type of treatment and surgery that rises with increasing age so that even small burns may be fatal in elderly people.Prognosis Survival after burn has steadily the primary outcome measure for burn care. Scoring systems aim to the most predictive premorbid and injury factors to for given patient. The Baux rule is a simple scoring system based on predictor variables that are available without the use of laboratory tests or special instrumentation. It is a simple rule of thumb to calculate the Burn Index (BI) that adds the age of the patient to the percentage of body surface area This index is presence of full-thickness of TBSA burned, and presence of inhalation injury. It is as simple and as easy to use as the clinical rule of thumb of Baux, yet it is more accurate and specific in describing outcomes for the victims of burn injury. index, however, does not take into account significant inhalation injury remains a leading cause of death in adult burn victims. The risk of inhalation injury increases with the extent of the burn and is present in two-thirds of patients with burns greater than 70% of TBSA. The treatment of pulmonary parenchymal injury inherently more complex than treatment burns. Necrotic skin can be combustion. This syndrome airway thermal injury - Chemical/inflammatory injury of the lower airways - Systemic damage It is important to obtain information on the source of the fire, the presence of smoke, duration of exposure, whether smoke inhalation occurred in a and the initial neurological condition of the patient. The degree influenced by the extent of exposure, the toxicity of the smoke constituents to the patient was exposed, the temperature, oxygen levels, concentration of smoke to fuel ratio) systemic response secondary to inhalation, which could be responsible in the lungs.Upper airway injury Upper airway injury can be thermal damage or chemical irritation. The inhalation of hot air at temperatures of 150\u00b0C and above will usually cause direct thermal injury to the face, oropharynx and upper airway. While heat and the chemicals in smoke cause immediate injury to the mucosa, the consequences there is sufficient swelling to compromise the upper airway. The presence of skin burns in this region magnifies the problem in direct proportion to the extent and depth of the burn. The volume of of smoke inhalation in closed spaces, burns to the face, neck, lips and oropharyngeal mucosa, singed nasal hairs and the presence of progressive or a cough productive of oropharynx for the presence of soot, or evidence of chemical or thermal damage. Direct laryngoscopy is a useful, quick and Immediate injury to the airway mucosa manifests itself by the presence of edema, erythema and ulceration. Due to the fact that edema may over multiple examinations to known damage.Treatment is protect the airway by endotracheal intubation or if can safely be managed without this procedure. One should not wait for signs of obstruction to proceed with intubation. When in doubt of whether progressive edema is likely, it is safest to intubate. There are three categories of patients at risk for airway compromise. [22](#bib0325) - (a) Heat and smoke injury and neck burns: this group invariably requires intubation. - (b) Significant these patients have difficulty controlling may hinder the process at later stages. - (c) Heat and smoke injury, no facial burns: if there are no signs of severe upper airway edema, close monitoring may suffice. Damage to the lower airways and lung parenchyma following smoke inhalation tends to be chemical smoke damage endothelial cells of the be directly proportional to the degree of exposure to smoke. This is probably due to the composition of the inhaled material and differences in the consequences are airway obstruction and bronchospasm, which usually first and intrapulmonary shunting and pulmonary infection, which usually develop the few days. The diagnosis of inhalation injury is clinical and accompanied by a of indirect observations. While the presence of carbonaceous secretions is an indicator of exposure to smoke, it does not establish or necessary sensitivity to detect lung damage in the early stages, but its use is helpful as a baseline for determining than the patient has increased work of breathing or if gas exchange compromised. The consensus recommendations for mechanical ventilation also strategies for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia situations and is not a standard therapeutic option time.Systemic damage: poisoning While the gas-phase components of smoke produce no direct injury to the respiratory tract, they typically produce binding affinity it the the liver especially, have the ability to detoxify cyanide through which excreted in the urine. Large amounts of cyanide may cause cyanide poisoning and (the organ most to hypoxia). There is no set combination of symptoms that confirms or rules out obtained at the scene and transported with the patient to the hospital, or obtained at the time of patient evaluation in the emergency department. Pulse CO-oximetry, where a probe is positioned on the fingertip is a technology which has been available since 2005. Although its accuracy and reliability have been of chemical airway injury. Low mean minimal exposure, as oxygen management in the early stages can reduce levels during transport to the emergency department. of toxicity depends on of cyanide in the intoxication. However, diagnosis is difficult, as in both cases: remove the victim from monoxide poisoning CO from Hb. Levels of COHb decrease about 50% 20min To successfully treat CO it important of prolonged exposure, when it is harder to displace CO from the cytochrome system. The drawback of HBOT is the need to transfer the burn patient to a treatment facility equipped with a hyperbaric chamber during the critical period of hemodynamic and pulmonary in the treatment of poisoning is is a compound which is in the urine. Patients may show reversible mucous membranes. Fairly marked, dark red chromaturia is normal at High recommended) rates is administered by inhalation are used in the industry, agriculture, house cleaners and others and many of them have been identified as having the potential to cause burns. The variety of chemical agents is so vast that it makes impossible to describe all treatments, but we can provide general principles for the management and treatment of chemical injuries. Chemical burns only represent near the 3% of all burns but they present an important morbidity, commonly involve cosmetic body, like series carry approximately there is a coagulation of protein due to irreversible cross-linking reactions, whereas in burns protein by hydrolysis mechanisms. These mechanisms so the offending agent are present especially in deeper skin layers. In chemical agents may produce a systemic toxicity. The contact, penetration and mechanism of action. Chemical injury is classified either by the mechanism of action or by chemical class of the agent.Mechanisms of action There are six mechanisms of action and reduce pH from 7 to values as low as 0. Acids with a pH less than 2 can produce coagulation necrosis on contact with the skin. Bases: Alkalis with a pH greater than 11.5 produce severe through liquefaction This tissue liquefaction allows deeper penetration of the agent. For burns tend to be more severe than acid burns. The ABC of Trauma, Primary and Secondary Assessment and all general principles of Trauma and Burn Care apply to chemical burns. However, there are also some measures of first aid that must be applied in chemical burns: - - Removal of the chemical agent and irrigation of burn area: the duration of the chemical's contact with skin is major determinant of This removal involved accident. It be repeated when patient arrives Burn Center. Periods of 30min to 2h of lavage may be necessary to keep pH between 5 and 11. There are a few notable exceptions, because same chemicals produce significant exothermy and also other chemicals are insoluble in water. These are the cases of dry lime, muriatic acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. - - Neutralizing agents: this is a point. In most instances, antidotes should be avoided. Dilution, not neutralization, is There are two notable 2% copper sulfate immerse in water). [33,34](#bib0380) - - General support and local care: conventional thermal formula On other hand, clinical assessment of the deep and extent of a chemical burn is difficult because of the unusual skin tanning and chemical agents. After lavage and debridement of blisters, chemical burns can be treated with similar chemotherapeutic and possible. Eyes are often involved in chemical burns. In these cases, immediate and to facilitate irrigation. According to the American National Standards Institute (Standard Z358.1-1990) severe eye burns have to be rinsed a rapid reduction of pH in conjunctival sac and in the corneal stroma. Systemic toxicity: Burn team must derived of systemic chemical burns when aerosolized chemical or smoke is inhaled. They are managed like smoke inhalation injuries. In conclusion, patients must be treated by specialized burn team and referred to a Burn Center as soon as possible. The gold standard for treatment is still copious irrigation immediately after accident increase mortality. [37](#bib0400) Special focus in chemical burn is necessary. First aid with intensive sterile irrigation with normal saline Irrigation not be Electrical injuries (excluding lightning) are responsible for >500 deaths per year in USA. A little more than half of them occur in the workplace and electrocutions at home account for >200 deaths per year and they are mostly associated with malfunctioning or misuse of consumer products. Electrical injuries are also the cause of considerable morbidity. Special important is the possibility of iatrogenic electrical injury in the current exists in two forms, the alternating current (AC) and the direct current (DC). AC current is the most commonly used in households and offices, and it is standardized to a frequency of 60Hz. When the current is direct, the electrons flow only in one direction. This type of current is produced by various batteries and is used in certain such defibrillators, pacemakers, and electric scalpels. Although AC is considered to be a far more efficient energy, it is also more dangerous than DC (approx. times) because it causes titanic muscle contractions that prolong the contact of the victim with the source. Lighting is a form of DC. Burn electrical injury is caused by passage of current through the body (solid conductor) resulting in conversion of electrical energy to heat. In general, the type and extent of an electrical injury depends on the intensity of the electric current. Exposure of different parts of the body to the same voltage will generate a different current and muscles; the highest resistance is in fat and tendons. Skin has intermediate resistance. The duration of the contact with electrical current is an important determinant of injury. In the same way, the pathway of the current through the body, from the entry to the exit point, determines the number of organs that are affected and, as a result, the type and severity of the injury. A vertical pathway parallel to the axis of the body is the most dangerous because it involves virtually all the vital organs (central nervous system, heart, respiratory muscles and in pregnant women, the uterus and the fetus). A horizontal pathway through the lower part of body may cause severe local damage but will probably not be lethal. [39,40](#bib0410) Electric shock from a low-voltage line is delivered on contact of the victim with the source, and in high-voltage injury, the current is carried from the source to the person though an arc before any actual physical contact is made. Arcs can generate extremely high temperatures (up to 5000\u00b0C) that are usually can be very extensive, it damage to the vital organs that may require intensive care. The most potential injuries are as follows: - - Cardiovascular system Pathophysiology. Electrical injury may affect the heart in two ways: by causing direct necrosis of the myocardium and by causing cardiac To same extent, the degree of myocardial injury depends of the voltage and the type of current, being more extensive with higher voltage and more severe with AC than DC electrical [41](#bib0420) Injury with exposure low currents. A current of more than 50-100mA with -to-hand hand-to-foot transmission can cause ventricular fibrillation. Exposure to current will most standstill the cardiac complications of the electric injury. However, variety of cutaneous injuries from the transformation of electrical to thermal energy. The injuries can range from the transformation of electrical to thermal energy. The injuries can range from local erythema to full-thickness burns. The severity of the burns depends on the intensity of the current, the surface area and the duration of exposure. The resistance of the skin may be markedly altered by moisture, and electric current may be transmitted to deeper tissues before it causes significant damage to skin. Thus, in contrast with thermal burns, the severity of the skin burns cannot be used to assess the degree of internal injury in an electrical accident with low voltage. More serious burns are usually caused by exposure to arcs that are created severity. When extensive flash and flame burns Nervous system Pathophysiology. Usually nervous system injury is not due to the direct effect of the electrical current itself but due to trauma or dysfunction of other organ systems. The passage of electrical current through the brain can cause injury to the respiratory control center that results in after electric injury to the brain. Direct injury to the spinal cord with transaction at the C4-C8 level may occur with hand-to-hand flow. The most common indirect injuries causing significant central system are cardiorespiratory arrest and fall. Peripheral nerves may incur secondary damage due to local burns or entrapment from scar formation, vascular injury or context of electrical injury due to lightning. [40](#bib0415) - - Respiratory system Pathophysiology. Although respiratory arrest is one of the common causes of acute death in severe electrical injury, there electric current. Clinical manifestations. apnea in cases of respiratory patients may a variety specific to the respiratory system. - - Other systems. Among other systems that may incur damage due to electrical injury, the kidneys are of particular importance. The kidneys are susceptible anoxic/ischemic injury. In addition, vascular compromise and muscle necrosis may cause renal tubular damage, leading to renal failure from release of myoglobin and creatinine phosphokinase. Even then, severe muscle contractions or from injury due to falls from significant heights. The eyes and the ears may be entry points of lightning strike and present a number of clinical problems. Transient autonomic disorders may cause fixed injury that in association an often unconscious patient, may be perceived as severe brain injury. Up to 50% of patients tympanic membranes of lightning injury but rare acutely present. [43](#bib0430) The combination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and multiple care. Treatment may follow the same principles of resuscitation as any other traumatic injuries, in special the access the victim giving the same threat to the rescuer as it does to the victim because, if the victim is still in contact with the source of the current he or she becomes a conductor that may electrocute the rescuer. Thus, no attempt to provide medical care should be made until either the source of the electrical current has been cut off or the victim has been extricated safely away from the current source. Specifically for patients to the ICU, the injury) and for blunt or abdominal - evaluation of indicated in severe cases of lightning injury, injuries due to a fall and there are abnormal neurologic findings. - Evaluation of necrosis. - Ophthalmologic and otoscopic evaluation. - management. of the initial injury and the development of complications.
