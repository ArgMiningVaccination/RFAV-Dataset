Ten years ago, the most common infections and cancers associated with HPV could be prevented by immunization with 2 vaccines, one bivalent, and another tetravalent, and having just marketed a nonavalent one. During the period 2007-2008, the HPV vaccine was included in the Autonomous Communities vaccination calendar, and it is the second vaccine, after that of Hepatitis B, that prevents cancer. In these 10 years that these vaccines have been available the knowledge has progressed and there have been significant advances in vaccination strategies, lowering the age in the vaccination schedule, prescribing of 2 doses at 9 years and at 13-14 years, systematic vaccination of the male in some countries, of at high risk of HPV infection, scientific evidence on the impact and effectiveness of vaccination, and confirmation of the safety of these vaccines, with more than 270 million doses administered, as has already been observed clinical to and maintain high vaccine coverage. El virus del papiloma humano (VPH) se identifica en primer lugar en dermatolog\u00eda y posteriormente se demuestra que es una causa necesaria para el desarrollo de c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino y de otros tumores, tras una infecci\u00f3n persistente por alguno de sus genotipos oncog\u00e9nicos. Desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, las infecciones y neoplasias m\u00e1s frecuentes relacionadas con el VPH pueden prevenirse mediante la inmunizaci\u00f3n con 2 vacunas, una bivalente y otra tetravalente, y acaba de comercializarse una nonavalente. Durante el periodo 2007-2008 se incluy\u00f3 la vacuna frente al VPH en el calendario de las comunidades aut\u00f3nomas y es la segunda vacuna, despu\u00e9s de la de la hepatitis B, que previene el c\u00e1ncer. En estos 10 a\u00f1os de disponibilidad de estas vacunas se ha progresado en su conocimiento y se han producido avances importantes en las estrategias de vacunaci\u00f3n y en las indicaciones y las recomendaciones: adelanto de la edad de vacunaci\u00f3n en el calendario, pautas de 2 dosis desde los 9 hasta los 13-14 a\u00f1os, vacunaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica del var\u00f3n en algunos pa\u00edses, inmunizaci\u00f3n de la mujer m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la adolescencia, implementaci\u00f3n de programas de vacunaci\u00f3n en pa\u00edses en desarrollo, prevenci\u00f3n de otras neoplasias, recomendaciones de vacunaci\u00f3n para poblaciones de riesgo elevado de infecci\u00f3n por el VPH, evidencia cient\u00edfica del impacto y la efectividad de la vacunaci\u00f3n, y confirmaci\u00f3n de la seguridad de estas vacunas, con m\u00e1s de 270 millones de dosis administradas, como ya se hab\u00eda observado en los ensayos cl\u00ednicos. El papel de los profesionales de la salud es fundamental para alcanzar y mantener coberturas vacunales elevadas. Introduction: a century of human papillomavirus \"If men are not vaccinated, the prevalence of HPV will not decrease, as they are transmitters of infection.\" Zur Hausen, La Vanguardia, September 18, 2009. \"If men are not vaccinated, the prevalence of HPV will not decrease, as they are transmitters of infection.\" Zur Hausen, La Vanguardia, September 18, 2009. More than one century ago, in 1907, Ciuffo proved the infectious aetiology of warts and suggested that the cause was a virus, since he was able to transmit the infection sexually 1940s, the of electronic allowed the identification of viral these warts (human papillomavirus [HPV]). In 1953, Bunting was the first to visualize a virus, HPV, within the cells of a wart (papilloma). [2](#bib0170) Thus, dermatology and venereology are found in the origins of the history of the pathology of HPV. In the 1970s, Orth [3](#bib0175) potential of the virus verruciformis, and in the 1980s, Zur Hausen [4](#bib0180) found that HPV DNA is present in most cervical cancers. This author was awarded for his discovery of the role of infection in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ten years ago, in 2008, sharing the honour with Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Montaigner, who received the award for their discovery of human immunodeficiency virus. In the 1990s, Bosch et al. [5](#bib0185) and Walboomers et al. [6](#bib0190) confirmed that HPV was present in nearly every case (99.7%) in a series of cervical cancer biopsies from patients in 22 countries; presence of the virus is necessary, although not sufficient, for the development of this cancer along with other cofactors that determine the malignant progression of infection or high-risk genotypes out of the 150 that cause cutaneous or genital disease is necessary the well as anogenital and oropharyngeal tumours, and its in other types of tumours is currently under investigation. The risk of to lesions greater the are silent and temporary resolve spontaneously within 2 years from transmission. Five percent of all human cancers worldwide are associated with HPV. [9](#bib0205) Last of all, the most significant breakthrough in regards to HPV has been the development of vaccines in the past 10 years that can prevent to in the future with therapeutic or oncogenic, as they contain no viral DNA, but they can induce production of antibodies against the virus. Vaccinology enters the history of HPV one century after it starts and plays a key role in the complex and fascinating chapter that is currently and participating. When 2017 ends, it will have been 10 years since the first 2 HPV vaccines were introduced in the Spanish market\u2014first, the quadrivalent one, in October 2007 (HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18), which had already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, and then the bivalent one (HPV 16 and 18), in January 2008. The results of a clinical trial of an earlier monovalent vaccine (HPV 16) had been published in 2002, showing an efficacy of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-100), but this vaccine never reached the market, as a quadrivalent vaccine developed by the same laboratories was in late-stage trials. [10](#bib0210) A fourth vaccine was licensed in May 2017, the nonavalent vaccine, that expands the spectrum of prevention with the inclusion of 5 additional HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58); the FDA approved it in December 2014. [11](#bib0215) In October 10, 2007, the Consejo Interterritorial del Sistema Nacional de Salud (Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health Service) included vaccination against HPV in its immunization schedule, and recommended routine vaccination of all girls in a single age cohort, to be chosen between 11 and 14 years by communities introduced rest during 2008. [12](#bib0220) The routine immunization schedule of the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Pediatr\u00eda (Spanish Association of Pediatrics) has included vaccination against HPV since 2008. The current vaccination of all girls, preferably at 12 years, or at a later age if vaccination is delayed, and providing information increase prevention of HPV-related cervical cancers from 70% to 90%, and may prevent between 85% and 95% of HPV-related vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers. [13](#bib0225) The HPV genotypes included in the 3 vaccines cause between 70% and 90% of precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions; the genotypes included in and nonavalent vaccines cause 90% of anogenital warts and a variable percentage of other lesions and the oropharyngeal regions (13%-72% of cancers of cases of anal cancer). [14](#bib0230) The HPV vaccine is the second vaccine included in the routine immunization schedule to prevent cancer, following the hepatitis B vaccine, and the third one, after the hepatitis B and A vaccines, introduced to prevent a sexually transmitted in the world.Advances in vaccination against human papillomavirus in the first decade of the HPV vaccine In the 10 years that HPV vaccines have been available, we have furthered our knowledge made significant progress vaccination against HPV: - Lowering of the age of vaccination from age 14 years to preadolescence (11-12 years), possibly starting at age 9 years, as specified in the summary of product characteristics, which is currently done in some countries. To achieve the maximum possible protection, it is important to vaccinate before sexual debut individuals prior to potential HPV exposure. of use of schedule for all 3 vaccines in children aged 9-14 (9-13 years for trial of a single-dose schedule led by Rolando Herrero is going to be carried out in Costa Rica in a sample of 20000 adolescents aged 12-16 developing countries. vaccination boys and Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. [13](#bib0225)In men, immunization prevents development of anogenital warts, precancerous anal lesions and anal cancer. We expect in the future, further research will prove the effectiveness of the justification of universal vaccination is the prevention of the sexual transmission of the virus, as both men and women are involved in the chain of infection and may immunity. - Vaccination of women past adolescence: this is a new approach in the this heterogeneous terms of HPV status, with effectiveness decreasing with increasing age. For this reason, recommendations made from a public health perspective do not include women aged more than 25 whom physician. It should be taken into that risk of being newly infected by HPV in sexually active women the and that persistent frequent with increasing age and immunosenescence. [19,20](#bib0255)In 2012, the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Patolog\u00eda Cervical y Colposcopia (Spanish Association of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy), supported by several other scientific societies, published first article establishing recommendations and the vaccination of women programmes, [21](#bib0265)followed, in 2016, a clinical practice guideline that the following recommendation for this age group: \"women aged more may benefit HPV, regardless of whether they 2013 thanks to the collaboration of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), expected to reach more than 40 million young women in over 40 countries by 2020. [23](#bib0275)The World Health Organization fact sheet on immunization coverage published in July 2017 reported that by the end of 2016, the HPV vaccine had been introduced in 74 countries, including 4 in which the vaccine had only been introduced in some regions. [24](#bib0280) - Prevention of tumours outside the anogenital which [9,14](#bib0205) of the first recommendations for vaccination of at malignant transformation: individuals with infection, who have sex with men, women aged more than 25 years with HPV should performed in vaccinated women, although with the pertinent modifications to the screening protocol regarding the age at which screening should start, its frequency, and the diagnostic test employed, changes that will reduce screening costs. The awareness of the viral aetiology of cervical cancer has allowed the use of additional methods in screening such the vaccination against HPV: a large amount of data and scientific evidence has been accumulated in the past 10 years, providing solid evidence of its effectiveness in preventing genital warts in men and women and the development of precancerous lesions in the cervix. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of 20 articles published between January 2007 and February all corresponding to studies conducted in 9 high-income countries (United States, Australia, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark, Canada and Germany), and representing person-years of followup, analyzed the between that achieved a vaccination coverage rate 68% decrease in the prevalence of warts aged herd was articles published over a 10-year period (2007-2016) found reductions of about 90% in the prevalence of infection by HPV types included in the quadrivalent vaccine and the frequency of anogenital warts, an 85% reduction in the frequency of high-grade cervical lesions, and a reduction in the frequency low-grade cervical lesions. [14](#bib0230) - Safety of HPV vaccines. The more than 270 million doses administered worldwide since 2006 and the systematic reviews and meta-analyses published to date provide solid evidence of the high safety of these vaccines, confirming the results their such as Japan, Colombia and Denmark, significant of cervical cancer in Japan in recent years. [27](#bib0295)Some of the diseases involved in these out a causal relationship between these diseases and administration of the HPV vaccine. The latest update of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) on the safety of HPV vaccines, included in its 2017 report and its seventh statement on the subject since 2007, reasserted the high safety of these vaccines and ruled out the possibility of any association with these diseases. The GACVS reported an overall risk of anaphylaxis of 1.7 cases per million doses of HPV vaccine, similar to that of other vaccines, and that syncope is a common anxiety or to that inadvertent administration of HPV vaccine during pregnancy has not been associated with adverse events in mother, foetus or newborn. a pandemic, as it is universal (affecting men and women throughout the lifespan and worldwide), the HPV and its prevention provides yet another example of the interconnection of different specialties, which is found in many fields of medicine. Professionals involved in the vaccination and the promotion and implementation of coverage Spain (somewhat lower compared to the previous year).

School-based vaccination is a high vaccination coverage rates, as for example, programme implemented in the adolescent population of Catalonia in the past 25 years.
