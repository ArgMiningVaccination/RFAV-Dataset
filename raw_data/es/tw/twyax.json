La tosferina es una infecci\u00f3n respiratoria inmunoprevenible altamente contagiosa, con alta morbilidad y mortalidad, y que afecta con especial gravedad a reci\u00e9n nacidos y lactantes menores de 2 meses. Las primeras vacunas comenzaron a emplearse en la d\u00e9cada de los 40. Sin embargo, desde 1980 la incidencia de casos ha aumentado a pesar de los amplios programas de vacunaci\u00f3n y tratamientos antibi\u00f3ticos adyuvantes disponibles. El cambio del uso de vacunas celulares a vacunas acelulares, y las modificaciones antig\u00e9nicas de B. pertussis han podido contribuir entre otros factores a la disminuci\u00f3n de la inmunidad adquirida tras la vacunaci\u00f3n y a la reemergencia de la enfermedad. En la actualidad, todav\u00eda existen necesidades no cubiertas por las medidas convencionales de prevenci\u00f3n y los tratamientos antibi\u00f3ticos existentes. Esta revisi\u00f3n pretende actualizar los datos disponibles y plantear qu\u00e9 estrategias vacunales pueden contribuir a un mejor control y prevenci\u00f3n global de la enfermedad. The main aetiological agent Pertussis is an acute respiratory infection characterized by violent cough that can last for weeks or months and is seen mostly in the preschool and school-age population. Although adolescents and adults are the main reservoir of the microorganism and play a crucial role in its transmission, it is infants under 4 months who have the highest incidence severe forms of the disease, which often requires advanced life support. In the last 20 years, a reemergence of the infection has been observed, making it one of the vaccine-preventable diseases. of B. pertussis strains that escape the immunity conferred by the vaccine and the gradual reduction of protection acquired after vaccination therapeutic strategies with most vulnerable population (infants<4 months) and reducing the rising trend in the incidence of pertussis in the general population. This B. the the preventive actions related to existing vaccine strategies may its control and prevention.Epidemiological situation of pertussis The European Union (EU) and of infections estimates pertussis were participating countries 2018, with a notification rate of 8.2 cases/100000 population, similar to that of the previous 4 years but the lowest observed in the same time period. [1](#bib0525) Five countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom) accounted for 72% of all notified cases, and 62% of cases were individuals aged over 15 years. Infants under 1 year, who had not completed the primary pertussis vaccination series because of their young age, were the most affected age with the evolution of the infection in adolescents and adults is of particular concern because of their In adults, clinical is explain the significant underreporting of cases. [2](#bib0530) The review of the definition of pertussis cases by the EU in 2018 probably helped [3,4](#bib0535) EU states report Community definition, based on extensive surveillance with hospital-based sentinel surveillance system, which includes only infants under 6 months. There are two surveillance systems in Denmark: one laboratory-based (which includes all age groups) and another in which doctors must report pertussis cases in children under 2 years. In Spain, pertussis has been a notifiable disease since 1982 and but also in children. [2](#bib0530) Underreporting of symptomatic cases is considerable in children 1 year, although the highest percentage of underreporting (50%) has been identified in infants under 1 year. In the period 1997-2010, the overall reported incidence of hospitalization for 22.8%, according to the study year. [5](#bib0545) These data support the need for rapid laboratory diagnostic tests and greater surveillance of family contacts of any age that help to better quantify existing cases. Intensified surveillance may also better understanding pertussis transmission patterns in family and regional epidemiological surveillance systems with the use of complementary active systems that allow actual incidence data to be determined and by introducing innovative approaches (such as Big Data analysis, based on real-time of of increased 2011. The highest rates are recorded in infants under 1 year, followed by children aged 5-9 years, as observed in Catalonia, Galicia, Madrid and Valencia and in outbreaks in Andalusia, Valencia, and five epidemic waves of pertussis have been described. Since 2010, there has been a sustained epidemic that the The incidence has been increasing in infants under 1 year, who continue to be the most affected. Incidence rates (IRs) per 100000 population were cases in 2017 and 2018, respectively, followed by IRs for children aged 1-4 years (56.7 and 39.5 in 2017 and 2018, respectively), 5-9 years (62.3 and 30.3), and 10-14 years (37.1 and 33.0). [15](#bib0595) These a to infection due decreased immunity after years of low incidence and highlight the need for new vaccination to the IR in recent years, with the highest rate in of hospitalizations in Spain per 100000 population in the period 1997-2010 was 131.02 cases in infants under 1 year, increasing to 250.13 in the period 2011-2015 and decreasing to 157.69 in 2016-2017. Most total, 34, 36 deaths were reported in the three periods, respectively. Following the implementation of maternal vaccination by region, per 100000 children according to the year of introduction of maternal vaccination in Spain updated with 2018 data [19](#bib0615). The resurgence (PRN), protein essential for bacterial adhesion to the upper respiratory tract epithelium which is present in some vaccines. Spain, antigen typing of B. pertussis strains isolated over the past 30 years has confirmed that after the transition from whole-cell to acellular vaccines, bacterial lineages that produce vaccine antigens different to those contained in current vaccines have is also essential to identify changes immunity, the strains that can evade the immunity conferred by the vaccine, and to identify the emergence of other Bordetella species that cause clinical symptoms similar to those produced B. pertussis, and the vaccines currently employed are not useful. [24](#bib0640) Culture NAATs do not depend on the bacterial viability, so bacteria can be detected even in cases of persistent cough lasting more than three weeks or after patients have been treated with antibiotics. In addition, most of the currently available NAATs can detect in the same test not but also Bordetella species or the recently described B. holmesii, which has been associated with and identified in 4.1% of laboratory-confirmed whooping cough cases between 2013 and 2016 in Barcelona. [26](#bib0650) As macrolides show lower activity against B.holmesii than that acellular confer cross-protection diagnosis determine the real incidence of toxin is exclusively produced by B. pertussis and there is no cross-reactivity similar antigens present other microorganisms. the immune response by PT included in the vaccine cannot differentiated from the response to natural as erythromycin, with a high safety profile. In the case of neonates (under 1 month of age), azithromycin is the recommended antibiotic due to its good tolerance and high safety profile, while erythromycin has been associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric [31](#bib0675) Over the past strains that are resistant to macrolides have emerged as result of mutations in their 23S ribosomal RNA encoding gene. Since the first description in the United States (US) in 1995, sporadic cases have been described in France, Iran and Japan. [24,32,33](#bib0640) However, the high prevalence of macrolide-resistant B. necessary to prevent its spread. After the first vaccine authorized in the in 1914, whole-cell pertussis replacing DTwP vaccines to may filamentous or (FIM-2 and FIM-3). Multiple studies show that none of these factors alone is a determinant of vaccine efficacy, although most authors agree that the fundamental component is the PT that directly induces the generation difficult to studies of the various DTaP vaccines. In Germany, only PT and PRN were found to be significantly associated with immune Two exposure to pertussis, against the vaccine antigens was than that generated against other colleagues estimated the efficacy of a 2-component vaccine at 85%, which led to its approval within the regulatory framework and implementation in vaccination programmes. [42](#bib0730) A single-component vaccine (PT) is still in use in northern Europe, with an efficacy of 71%. [43](#bib0735) However, the comparison of efficacy between wP and aP vaccines or between different aP vaccines has not led to clear conclusions, and there is no evidence to support the superiority of one aP vaccine over another. [44,45](#bib0740) Most of the acellular is not optimal, and factors such as waning immunity over time and expansion of clones with antigenic polymorphism could explain why their effectiveness and aP vaccines, to non-combination vaccines and a safety profile comparable to that offered by separate administration of any mortality in the first months of life before they begin from mother, and indirectly by passive transplacental transfer of antibodies to the foetus, which will protect the baby until the first dose of vaccine is received at 2 months of age. There is a good correlation between maternal post-vaccine IgG1 concentrations and those [54](#bib0790) Early immunization during the second trimester been associated with IgG avidity to PT in cord blood is higher in mothers vaccinated early in those vaccinated later. [56](#bib0800) However, a higher level of scientific evidence is still needed to determine the optimal time for immunization in pregnancy. Maternal immunization with low-dose acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) been shown to as booster after primary immunization in children, adolescents and adults. A small increase in the incidence reported in vaccinated pregnant women, although this has not other [59](#bib0815) main efficacy/effectiveness studies of in shown and after vaccination (with significant variations between different vaccines and countries with well-established maternal immunization programmes have not an increase in pertussis cases in or older children. A lower titre anticapsular diphtheria toxin infants mothers were comparable after the primary vaccination and booster doses, except for serotype 3. [64](#bib0840) The US was the first country to introduce maternal vaccination in 2011, with a Tdap dose between weeks 27 and 36 of gestation and revaccination in every pregnancy. The estimated pertussis during first 12 months of life. [65](#bib0845) The United Kingdom (UK) incorporated it in 2012, reaching 64% coverage in the first year of implementation and 93% vaccine effectiveness in pertussis two of [66](#bib0850) According to 2019 data, maternal vaccination is already in place in 18 countries in Europe, although the gestational time week indicated. In Spain, the Public Health Commission approved the anti-pertussis maternal vaccination programme in 2015, been implemented in some autonomous regions (like Catalonia and Asturias) since 2014. The vaccination schedule includes a dose pregnancy; if there is risk of prematurity, the Spanish Association of Paediatrics (AEP) also recommends vaccination from week scheduled 20-week pertussis in infants, with lower strategy earlier [19](#bib0615) ( World Health Organization (WHO) recommends starting vaccination at 6-8 weeks of life and considers that it is essential not to delay at dose. In Spain, pertussis vaccination began in 1975, with three doses of whole-cell vaccine before age 6-7 months. Doses at 15-18 months and 4-6 years were of age, due to their lower reactogenicity. Administration of a fifth dose at 4-6 years of age was incorporated into the vaccination schedule in 2005. In 2012, the second booster dose replaced by the low-dose acellular vaccine (Tdap). Since 2017, the Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health Service has recommended primary vaccination of age, and a booster dose at 11 months in a 2+1 schedule that remains in force today. [69](#bib0865) To complete the vaccine schedule, a fourth dose should be given at 6 years of age with a combined vaccine (DTaP-IPV or Tdap-IPV). The fifth dose should be tetanus and vaccine, Td, although the Tdap vaccine has been administered Asturias since 2017, as recommended by the AEP. Similar vaccine schedules, with slight variations in the number of doses and the time at which they are administered, are used in other European Union countries. [73](#bib0885) Since 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have authorized the use for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination in who are not vaccinated or who require booster doses. Data are available on the impact of the administration of the first dose of pertussis vaccine in NB at 6 or 8 weeks, but few studies have compared immunogenicity and safety according to the time of administration. A phase III confirmed satisfactory immunogenicity and safety, suggesting that it could be an alternative to protecting the child against pertussis in cases where the vaccine not of protection has been established. observed that after the administration of combined vaccines with a or 3+1 IgG although the monitoring should be performed for 48-72h in very premature children (born at 28 weeks of gestation) and in particular, in infants with a history of respiratory immaturity. [78](#bib0910) According to 2019 data, 90% of children at least one dose of doses 4](#tbl0020)). In Spain, in 2018, all autonomous regions except for the Balearic Islands (which did not provide information) reported coverage of more than 95% of the cohort for the first two doses of hexavalent vaccine during the first year. However, for the third dose at months, six overall coverages slightly below 95.5%, Vaccination coverage during routine immunization programmes with 1 or 3 doses of the DTP vaccine in the World Health Organization (WHO) primary vaccination with natural immunity after infection) is limited, a feature common to all types of vaccines (cellular and acellular). [80](#bib0920) For each year after the of acellular vaccine, there is an estimated 27-33% increase in the chances of developing with standard-dose vaccines (DTaP) remain last dose. [80,81](#bib0920) This justifies the need for booster doses at adolescent and age. pertussis in an environment where transmissibility conditions are very high. No significant differences have been found so far in the duration of immune protection acquired after a childhood vaccination 3 or 5 doses of DTaP. [80](#bib0920) Nevertheless, published data in Australia showed that booster dose at 18 in pertussis notification rates in children aged 1-4 years, translated an increase in the prevalence of undetectable IgG levels from 1997 vaccine guidelines on the incidence of pertussis in children. The gradual in the protection acquired after the primary vaccination justifies the need for a booster in preschool age. It has been pertussis would increase almost with age by an average of 42% for each year after the last dose a DTaP vaccine. The amount of protection depends DTaP effectiveness of 95% would decrease to 71% after 5 years of last dose of vaccine and 90% effectiveness would decrease to 42% in the same period of time. [84](#bib0940) In children aged 5-9 years, effectiveness would exceed would remain immune to pertussis 4 of DTaP vaccines in the booster dose. The estimated age for receiving this dose is 3-7 years. In Spain, the combined standard load vaccine (DTaP-IPV) is recommended whenever possible, and preferably the Tdap-IPV of age. [69](#bib0865) Official agencies, such as the WHO and to children with whom they are in contact. The vaccination strategy for adolescents and adults has demonstrated its efficacy, safety and benefit. [88,89](#bib0960) In the US, Tdap vaccination in adolescents years). [72,91,92](#bib0880) Currently, in Spain, Tdap vaccination at the age of 13 is only funded in Asturias. Most European Union countries their vaccine schedules. [73](#bib0885) The recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health for adult vaccination are limited to pregnant women, health professionals working in paediatrics, obstetrics and their respective emergency areas, and professionals working in close contact with cases and in the control of pertussis epidemic outbreaks. These measures are that childcare providers boosters in adulthood can strengthen the level of immunization of the population and thus reduce bacterial circulation. [6](#bib0550) The CDC has recently authorized the use of the Tdap vaccine in any adult situation, as a replacement or as a possible alternative to Td in cases indicated the administration of throughout life is sufficient to protect against tetanus up to the age of 65, but this strategy fails to provide pertussis childhood is constantly increasing worldwide, especially in the support by caring for infants and children, so this is a population group with a particular risk of infection and, consequently, of transmission to their immediate environment (parents, grandparents, siblings, others who live with disease transmission. Despite during pregnancy. In countries such as Australia, France, Germany and the US, this measure was introduced in 2000. However, since the vaccine coverage achieved is suboptimal in most cases, this for a comprehensive prevention strategy to protect all age groups susceptible to pertussis and transmission, that should include the Rapid, sensitive diagnosis. Surveillance the vaccine and susceptibility of B. pertussis as well as the of pertussis-like pathology. Vaccination with Tdap as a double measure of protection for mothers and infants under 2 months. - Compliance the current 2+1 primary vaccination schedule with hexavalent vaccines at 2 and age, and booster at 11 months. Vaccination of PNBs (which can be done with be completed according vaccination preschool-age children as protection against the risk of infection associated with the loss of vaccine immunity achieved after the primary vaccination. - Vaccination of adolescents to reduce the risk associated with loss of immunity. - The implementation of complementary disclose financial the research, authorship, and publication of this article: Sanofi Pasteur (Madrid, Spain) supported this work but had no role in the preparation of the manuscript.Conflict of interests Juan Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez has compensation for consultant services for Sanofi Pasteur, has received research support from Sanofi Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and has collaborated in educational activities funded by Sanofi and has as for trials funded by GSK, Novartis, and Sanofi has collaborated in educational activities funded by services as consultant for Sanofi-Pasteur, GSK, MSD, and Pfizer.
