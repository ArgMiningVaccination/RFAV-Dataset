IMRT - A Complex Process Planning Position Verification target a set of beam weights obtains a plan by a trial-and-error process. This procedure won't work for IMRT since there are too many unknowns (>2000 beamlet weights). How can we determine the individual beamlet weights for IMRT ? 23. What is sequencing 24. D i = C ij W j -- Weight for beamlet j w j C ij -- dose contribution in voxel i from beamlet j in an open beam i j 25. 26. 27. However, Unfortunately this inverse process does not work in most, if not all, realistic treatment cases. Practically, what we want is a set of beamlet weights that will give us the best available dose distribution ! is an exact beamlet weights for a desired dose distribution D 0 28. 29. 30. 31. There are many ways to optimize a treatment plan for a given objective function (forward, backward, hybrid, may use any optimization algorithms (more likely it is a forward planning, or a hybrid, process). There are many ways to build an objective function (everybody wants his/her own)! 32. 33. Major differences optimization systems are the construction of the objective function and methods for optimization methods use an iterative approach, one way or another "}
