Incorporating Nutrition Into Your Clinical Practice Guidance for the Provider 1-1Good nutrition has always been an important part of good health. Most people know a little about nutrition. Somewhere, most of us have learned about the basic four food groups. It is possible that somewhere we have even seen the Food GuidePyramid. It is more difficult, the right foods in the right amounts at the right time. It can be simple.The purpose of this manual is to help make good eating and, thus, good nutrition easy foreveryone. Over the past few years it has been increasingly documented that good nutrition is an inte- gral part of health care for people with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). However,very few people really grasp the concept of how to apply even basic food groups to whatthey actually eat. Therefore, the authors have tried to from very basic tospecific. As often as possible, a chart or table is instead lengthy One pageinformation sheets materials have withthe that these tools will be used primarily by non-nutritionists in most settings. This manual can assist health care providers and people with HIV in the effort to make good nutrition (eating good food) a part of health care. Specific ideas are presented regarding theissues about eating and food that people with HIV confront on a daily basis. Health careproviders should monitor changes in body composition strongly recommended. If your clinic does nothave access to this equipment, see if someone else in your community does and will performthese measures for your clients. Several pharmaceutical companies that make products fortreatment of wasting may also help provide the equipment for testing, so ask the companyrepresentatives when they come to visit. (See Section 8 for more information aboutmeasuring body composition.). The manual is divided into several sections. There are very simple ideas presented in a straightforward way for those who are not interested in details. Additional information,scientific references and background information on many areas of concern in nutrition andHIV are also included. This information can be used by both providers and clients. The assessment tools provided are to be used, not only for assessing nutritional status, but also as a starting point for counseling. Routine use of these tools can help assure adequatenutritional care as the client's health status changes throughout the course of the disease. The manual can be used in whole or in parts. It is the intention of the authors that the information be simple and easy to use. It is designed to be updated from time to time andmodified to meet new emerging practices and issues in nutrition.

There are four separate tools that can be used either together or individually to providenutritional care to people with HIV . These are the assessment tools: 1. Quick Nutrition Screen (QNS): This is the place to begin any assessment. These 27 questions are related to common nutrition . The can fill out the questionnaire with or without assistance.Each of the questions is supported by a short \"nutritional screen note\" whichprovides additional information supporting that question. These are designed togive basic support information about why this issue is important to the HIV-positive client's nutritional collect history. The client fills out what is eaten on a usual day. A space is provided for the client and theprovider to evaluate what has been consumed (both food and drink) with a rec-ommended guide for the food groups which is targeted specifically for the indi-vidual with HIV. 3. Nutrition Assessment Tool (NAT): This tool can be kept in the client medical record as a way to keep track of key issues that are related to the nutritionalhealth of an individual. These are the minimum kinds of data that should betracked at clinics will have additional clinical information thatthey may record on a regular basis.

They are usually less expensive than brand name foods. Store brand frozen foods are especially economical. Try to buy the week's \"specials\". It may be possible to save as much as 40 - 50 cents a pound on meat if you buy it on special. However, watch \"bargains\". If an item is featured make sure it is actually priced the option. Also watch the expiration date, and meat that is outdated. You may find markdowns on slightly old fruits and vegetables on Saturdays. If a head of lettuce or escarole has been trimmed down so that the dark outer leaves are gone - it is too old. Bagged apples and oranges are usually less expensive, but be learning all you can about good nutrition and health. After all it is your life....enjoy every minute of it. Buy fresh produce in season. To get the most value for your dollar, it is important to learn how to cook basic foods. Next to eating out, the most expensive thing is buying \"convenience\" foods. In general, the more processed the food is, the more expensive it is. For example, it is less expensive to make mashed potatoes instant mashed If you buy frozen vegetables, it is more economical to buy the packages without seasoning or sauces built in and then add your own. Spices can be expensive, but they will save you money when you buy foods without seasonings and add your own. Buy a spice once or twice a month to build up a good selection. Fresh such as cilantro and parsley may be less expensive, but won't last as long. To lower your food budget you may want to shop for less expensive foods to substitute for the ones you currently buy. For example beef might be replaced with turkey or beans. If prices are up on rice or grits, substitute with pasta or bread. If you really enjoy eating meat, learn what good pieces of meat look like. There are many cuts between sirloin steak and hamburger. Bone-in chuck steaks cost the same as hamburger and make great broiled steaks. You can also serve meat with rice or vegetables so that the meat portion size can be smaller. Learn to read in order of quantity. Learn terms and standards specified by the USDA. For fruit punch is not 100% fruit juice, luncheon more example, sugar in the bag is cheaper than in the box, and spices in fancy boxes are more costly. Use unit pricing - the cost per ounce or per unit of the product - to compare the cost of similar products. Unit prices can be found on the label or shelf below the product.Childrens Issues 6-20Nutrition Guidance for Positive Children Keep learning all you can about good nutrition and health.

El comer alimentos saludables es especialmente importante para poder aumentar sus fuerzas f\u00edsicas para que usted pueda disfrutar de la vida lo m\u00e1s normalmenteposible cuando usted es VIH positivo. La buena nutrici\u00f3n es una coterapia que le puede ayudar a llevar al m\u00e1ximo el manejo m\u00e9dico del VIH. Una nutrici\u00f3n agresiva puede prevenir o demorar lap\u00e9rdida de sus m\u00fasculos. Este es un proceso que se llama desgaste VIH. Los estudios demuestran quesu salud nutritiva es un factor importante que influye en la sobrevivencia del VIH. Actualmente nohay cura para el VlH/SIDA, pero usted puede afectar el proceso de la enfermedad y mejorar la calidad de su vida manteniendo una actitud positiva y un estilo de vida saludable. Algunos de los cambios que usted puede hacer para tener un estilo de vida saludable incluyen: (1) seguir la intervenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica apropiada paratratar las infecciones; (2) escoger alimentos saludables; (3) manejar las tensiones de una manera positiva; (4)hacer ejercicios en forma regular, preferiblemente con pesas; y (5) integrar las terapias naturales y otrasterapias en el manejo de su plan de salud. Todas estas terapias trabajan juntas para ayudarle a su sistemainmunol\u00f3gico a combatir el VIH. Las personas con VIH/SIDA tienden a perder musculatura y las reservas de prote\u00ednas junto con diferentes cantidades de p\u00e9rdida de grasas. Hay tres razones principales por las cuales usted puede perderpeso, experimentar p\u00e9rdida de los m\u00fasculos y como resultado desarrollar malnutrici\u00f3n relacionada al VIH. Sitiene poco apetito, es posible que no est\u00e9 comiendo suficiente prote\u00ednas, calor\u00edas, vitaminas y minerales que sucuerpo necesita; el metabolismo de su cuerpo se acelera cuando hay infecciones; y por esto usted necesitacalor\u00edas y prote\u00ednas adicionales en sus comidas para mantener su peso; y si usted tiene diarrea cr\u00f3nica, sucuerpo pierde calor\u00edas, prote\u00ednas, vitaminas y minerales. Es muy importante mantener su tejido muscular fuerte, para llevara cabo las funciones del cuerpo y ayudarle a procesar los medicamentos. La meta primaria de la nutrici\u00f3n de las personas con VIH es agadurles a mantener y aumentar su peso muscular. Puede hacer esto comiendo comidas y tomando l\u00edquidos con muchas calor\u00edas para que su cuerpo no use su tejido muscular para extraer energ\u00eda durante lasinfecciones. Las siguientes comidas le d\u00e3 a su cuerpo energ\u00eda: almidones complejos y carbohidratos, az\u00facaressimples y grasas. Usted tambi\u00e9n necesita alimentos que le puedan proveer a su cuerpo con prote\u00ednas parapoder aumentar y mantener su musculatura. Puede escoger una combinaci\u00f3n de fuentes de prote\u00edna animal ouna combinaci\u00f3n de prote\u00edna vegetal que se puedan complementar, dependiendo de su preferencia. Tambi\u00e9nnecesita hacer ejercicios diarios y repetitivos para aumentar la fuerza muscular. Es bien importante el comer peque\u00f1as cantidades durante el d\u00eda, aun que no tenga hambre. Un plan de comida alto en prote\u00ednas, y calor\u00edas, que incluya comidas altas en carbohidratos complejos, y que incluya cantidades moderadas de grasas es el mejor para poder prevenir el desgaste muscular con elVIH. Esto puede cambiar si usted tiene s\u00edntomas espec\u00edficos o alg\u00fan otro problema m\u00e9dico. Su nutricionista o m\u00e9dico le pueden ayudar a modificar sus h\u00e1bitos de comer si tiene alg\u00fan s\u00edntoma en espec\u00edfico.

N\u00e1useas y V\u00f3mitos Las n\u00e1useas y los v\u00f3mitos pueden ser resultados de alguna infecci\u00f3n o tambi\u00e9n de algunas medicinas y tratamientos. Las sugeriencias siguientes pueden ayudarle a manejar los s\u00edntomas: Consuma comidas peque\u00f1as con frecuencia durante el d\u00eda en vez de dos o tr\u00e9s comidas grandes, y tome l\u00edquidos altos en calor\u00edas, media hora despu\u00e9s de comer. Evite el comer alimentos grasosos, fritos, o con muchas especies (picante). En su lugar, escoja alimentos fr\u00edos y con pocas especies picantes. Escoja alimentos secos como los cereales en cajas, galletitas, tostadas \"melbas\" y bizcochos. Usted puede tener estos al lado de su cama o su silla favorita para que est\u00e9n a su alcance. Consuma alimentos salados como galletitas, \"pretzels\" y palomitas de ma\u00edz (\"popcorn\") sin mantequilla para reducir las n\u00e1useas. No se acueste hasta por lo menos una hora despu\u00e9s de comer. Espere a digerir los alimentos antes de dormirse. Consuma los alimentos fr\u00edos o a temperatura ambiente. Los alimentos calientes pueden empeorar las n\u00e1useas. Evite comer sus alimentos favoritos cuando est\u00e9 enfermo, pueden llegar a disgustarle porque los asocia con las n\u00e1useas. Si el olor de la comida le da n\u00e1useas, p\u00eddale a otra persona que le cociney no se acerque a la cocina mientras se le prepara la comida. Una taza de t\u00e9 de hierbas con miel (por ejemplo, menta o manzanilla), o mascar la ra\u00edz del gengibre fresco a veces puede calmar un est\u00f3mago con n\u00e1useas. Preg\u00fantele a su m\u00e9dico acerca de alguna medicina para reducir las n\u00e1useas, por ejemplo \"Compazine\", \"Reglan\" o \"Marinol\".

Al Preparar La Comida Lave bien las frutas y los vegetales con agua tibia y un detergente suave de lavar platos y un cepillo con cerdas suaves. Usted puede tambi\u00e9n lavar las frutas y los vegetales con una mezcla de media taza de jugo de lim\u00f3n y un gal\u00f3n de agua tibia. O usted puede qui tar la c\u00e1scara o pelar lasfrutas y vegetales antes de comerlos. Cocine la carne, el pollo y el pescado hasta que est\u00e9n bien cocidos, hasta que no tenga nada de sangre. No coma la carne, el pollo, el pescado o los mariscos crudos incluyendo \"sushi\" o almejas cocidasal vapor. Descongele las carnes y los pollos en un plato en la nevera, no a temperatura ambiente.

No use los huevos que tienen hendeduras en su c\u00e1scara. Hierva los huevos por lo menos cinco minutos o fr\u00eda los huevos por lo menos tres minutos por cada lado.

No coma directamente de un recipiente de almacenaje porque las bacterias de la boca pueden hacer que la comida se destruya m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido. No sirva la comida con la misma cuchara con la que come. Haga una mezcla dilu\u00edda de legia, anadi\u00e9ndole 1-2 cucharas de legia por un gal\u00f3n de agua tibia. Use esta mezcla para limpiar los utensilios de cocina y las tablas de cortar alimentos antes y despu\u00e9s de preparar la comida. L\u00e1vese las manos con agua tibia y jab\u00f3n antes y despu\u00e9s de preparar las comidas. Al Guardar La Comida Ponga en la nevera la comida que no se comer\u00e1 inmediatamente. Si est\u00e1 preparando una cantidad grande de comida, sep\u00e1rela en recipientes peque\u00f1os y p\u00f3ngalos en la nevera para que la comida puede refrescarse m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y reducir el crecimiento de las bacterias. Tape la comida bien con un pl\u00e1stico o gu\u00e1rdela en recipientes herm\u00e9ticos para mantenerla fresca. No permita que el agua de la comida que est\u00e1 descongelando toque otra comida en la nevera. Refrigere todos los aceites para cocinar y para las ensaladas en la nevera.
