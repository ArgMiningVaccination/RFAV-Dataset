Correspondence: Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Paz Fern\u00e1ndez E-mail: japazf@unileon.esThe condition of being new in order to accept or reject a paradigm, is two sides of the same counterfeit coin. Some 9 years have passed since the WHO published its recom- mendations on physical activity for health, offering the general public some minimum recommended targets for daily physical activity. The main new feature of this guide is the of two three times a week, regardless of age (in fact from 5 years upwards) 1. Even so, these recommendations are all too frequently not included in the general exercise guidelines provided by medical practitioners. And it is even more disturbing to see how old beliefs, that are now known to be false, are still being maintained and conveyed, with regard to \"how strength training for children is a bad thing\" as affects the growth - gthening activities are really bad for those with high blood pressure or heart conditions\" etc. Numerous studies that demonstrate the safety and benefits of exercises of this type on healthy children 2-4, obese individuals5, or with heart diseases6, have been published. However, despite all this scientific and professional evidence, it has not been possible to do away with these misconceptions. Luckily for the health of the general public, physical exercise is currently being recommended recommending and, in cases, they are even expressly advising against such exercises. This point can be illustrated a survey conducted on 272,887 non-hypertensive their to the doctor, they had been recommended to exercise and, if so, whether they aerobic exercises, solely exercises or 36.9% of the healthy respondents had not been neither had 45.7% of the hypertensive those who had been advised to exercise, 23.1% and 15% were welfare suffering from a advised against strengthening exercises. This is despite the evidence to the contrary found in scientific publications, showing how important and safe it is to do strengthening exercises, either on their own or together with the aerobic exercises. Such is the other diseases and disorders. Due to the discrepancy between what is known through science and what is recommended by medical practitioners, there are reduced possibilities of functional improvement and an in infirm population alike. It would be to intensify their peda-gogical efforts towards general and specialty medicine with to of strengthening exercises. There are sufficient scientific make it correctly prescribe strength training in the healthcare the general public 21,22, children23, and cardiac patients24.La fuerza, la olvidada en la prescripci\u00f3n del ejercicio f\u00edsico para la salud67 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):66-67Although it is true that the benefits of exercise on health are related to the duration, intensity and frequency of the exercises, it is no less true that there is a relationship between the amount of strength training and its benefits on health.

M\u00e9todo: Treinta y nueve adolescentes (13 con peso normal, 13 con sobrepeso y 13 obesos) con edades comprendidas entre 12 y 14 a\u00f1os participaron en este estudio. Las herramientas Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) y K\u00f6rperkoordinationtest f\u00fcr kinder (KTK) se usaron para evaluar los niveles de actividad f\u00edsica y coordinaci\u00f3n motriz, respecti - vamente. Se usaron correlaciones bivariadas y parciales para analizar las interrelaciones entre la coordinaci\u00f3n motora, el IMC y la actividad f\u00edsica. El an\u00e1lisis de covarianza se utiliz\u00f3 para comparar los niveles de coordinaci\u00f3n motora entre los adolescentes de peso normal, con sobrepeso y obesos, considerando el nivel de actividad f\u00edsica como una covariable. Resultados: se encontraron correlaciones negativas y moderadas (p <0.05) entre la coordinaci\u00f3n motora y el IMC en la muestra como un todo, en los adolescentes con peso normal y obesos. Sin embargo, cuando se controlan los niveles de actividad f\u00edsica, no se observ\u00f3 una correlaci\u00f3n significativa en el grupo de peso normal. La coordinaci\u00f3n motora y el IMC no se correlacionaron significativamente en adolescentes con sobrepeso con y sin control de los niveles de actividad f\u00edsica. Adem\u00e1s, el nivel de coordinaci\u00f3n motora demostr\u00f3 una tendencia a ser menor en adolescentes con sobrepeso y obesos. Conclusi\u00f3n: El nivel de actividad f\u00edsica influy\u00f3 en la asociaci\u00f3n entre la coordinaci\u00f3n motora y el IMC en adolescentes de peso normal, pero no en adolescentes con sobrepeso y obesos. El efecto negativo del exceso de masa corporal en el nivel de coordinaci\u00f3n motora puede superponerse a la posible influencia que ejerce el nivel de actividad f\u00edsica en la asociaci\u00f3n entre la coordinaci\u00f3n motora y el IMC en los adolescentes con sobrepeso y obesos.

Method: Thirty and 13 obese) aged 12-14 years old, participated in this study. The Activity Questionnaire for Older (PAQ-C) and K\u00f6rperkoordinationtest were in order to levels BMI and physical activity. The analysis of covariance test was used in order to compare the negative correlations (p<0.05) were found between motor coordination and BMI in the sample as a whole, normal weight and obese groups. However, when controlled for physical activity it was not observed a significant co - rrelation in the normal weight group. Motor coordination and BMI were not significantly correlated in overweight levels. Furthermore, motor coordination level demonstrated overweight and obese adolescents. Conclusion: Physical activity level influenced the between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents, but not in overweight and obese. The negative effect of excess body mass on motor coordination level may overlap the possible influence that physical activity level exerts on the association between motor coordination and physical activity in adolescents with different weight status Daniel V.

Relaciones entre la coordinaci\u00f3n motora, \u00edndice de masa corporal y la actividad f\u00edsica en adolescentes con diferentes estados de peso corporal Correspondence: Daniel das Virgens Chagas E-mail: has become a global epidemic1, being recognized as one of the most serious public health concerns in the 21st century2. In Brazil, more than 8 million children and adolescents are estimated to be obese3. This high prevalence is a concern risks such also to be associated with poor motor coordination in children and adolescents4-6. Although few studies7,8 have not found significant associations between motor coordination level and body mass index (BMI), most evidence suggests these variables are negatively associated 9-14. Overall, these previous suggest than their normal weight peers. A plausible explanation for a negative association between BMI and motor coordination level in children and adolescents is based on biomechanical issues. That is, the higher the amount of body mass, the higher the mechanical work required to performing motor tasks, coordination and BMI can be mediated by several alternative mechanisms17. One of mechanisms that can mediate, or influence, the relationship between motor coordination level and BMI in pediatric population is the physical activity level 4,18. This assumption is based on evidence that physical activity level is positively associated with motor coordination level19,20. Also, it is important to recognize that not all obese children and adolescents have poor motor coordination or are physically inactive21. Therefore, the hypothesis that physical activity level may influence the association between motor coordination level and BMI in children and adolescents seems to be plausible. Chagas and Batista 22 found physical activity level influences the as - sociation between motor coordination level and BMI in normal weight, but not in their overweight/obese peers. However, adolescents in the same group. Therefore, it remains unknown if physical activity level can influence the associations between motor coordination level and BMI in obese adolescents. The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of physical activity level on associations between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight, overweight obese and method One hundred and fifty five adolescents (69 boys and 86 girls) between seventh and ninth grade of elementary school (age ranged between 12 and 15 years old) from a Brazilian public school were initially recruited to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria re - quired students to be under 15 years old with no history of injury or disease that could affect study obtained from the University's Committee and parental consent recruitment (N=155), eight subjects were excluded normal adolescents were to compose the final sample of 39 participants (17 boys and 22 girls). There was not missing data. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an electronic scale, participants school height was while unshod with a stadiometer wall to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI (kg/m 2) was then calculated. World Health Organization23 age-specific cut-off points for BMI were used in order to determine the weight status of normal appropriate for elementary school-aged children approximately between 8-14 years old who are currently in the school system and have recess as a regular part of their school week. The summary score from the PAQ-C is the average of the sum of the nine item questions, each scored on a 5-point scale, with 1 being the lower level of physical activity and 5 the higher level. Motor coordination level reliability tools for assessing children's motor coordination26 and it consists of four test items. The first is walking backwards along balance beams (3m length) of decreasing width (6, 4.5 and 3 cm). Each beam was crossed three times where a maximum of eight steps per trial were allowed (72 steps overall); the sum of steps \u00d7 \u00d7 5 cm; the maximum was 12 pillows or a height of 60 cm). Only three trials were allowed for each obstacle and three, two, or one point(s) were/was awarded for successful performance on the first, second, or third try, respectively. Therefore, a maximum of 39 points (including a ground level trial) could be scored for each leg; the points were summed to determine score 2. The third task was two-legged sideways jumping across a wooden slat (60 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm) for 15 s as quickly as possi - ble. The number of jumps was summed over two The final task involved moving sideways on wooden boards (25 cm \u00d7 25 cm \u00d7 5.7 cm) as many times as possible in 20 s. One point was awarded for each time the plate was transferred and one more for stepping on it. The number of relocations was count - ed and summed over two trials to determine score 4. KTK takes account motor each from the sum the scores obtained in the tests.Relationships among motor coordination, body index and physical activity in adolescents with different weight status 71 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):69-73Descriptive statistics were determined for all variables. The Kol - mogorov-Smirnov test confirmed acceptable normality of correlations used to analyse the relations- hip coordination level and BMI, controlling for physical activity levels. Analysis activity a covariate. A significance level of 5% ( = 0.05) was adopted in all statistical tests. Data analysis was executed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS ver. 22.0, IBM, USA). Results The total sample statistics of group 1 (normal weight), group 2 (overweight) and group 3 (obese) are provi - ded in Table 1. As motor coordination as weight status worsens, 2. Moderate were found between BMI and motor coordination levels in the group as a whole, as well as in the normal weight and obese correlations were only observed in the group as a whole and obese group. Discussion The main aim of this study was to analyze the influence of physical activity level on associations between motor coordination and BMI in adolescents with different weight status. Our findings suggested motor coordination level and BMI negatively associated in normal weight and obese adolescents. However, the between these was not significant when controlled for physical activity level in normal weight adolescents. On the other hand, motor coordination level were significantly negatively correlated suggest activity level can influence the association between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents. Furthermore, motor coordination level demonstrated weight status worsens. Moderate negative correlations between motor coordination level and BMI were observed in the group as a whole, normal weight and obese adolescents. These findings are in studies 9-14. Considering BMI as an indicator of body fat, it seems plausible to ex - pect that individuals with i.e. 1. body weight, BMI, motor coordination levels (MC) and physical activity levels (PA) of normal weight (group 1), overweight (group 2) and obese (group 3) adolescents.

Correlation non-significant (p>0.05). and standard That is, the higher BMI, higher physical difficulties experienced by individuals, such as Nevertheless, our overweight found associations between motor coordination level and BMI. These findings can be explained by the fact that individuals with the same weight status, or even with the same BMI, may have considerable differences in body composition. That is, overweight individuals with relatively high levels of lean mass and low levels of body fat may have no increased difficulty to perform motor tasks due their BMI status. correlations between motor coordination levels and BMI remained weak to moderate when controlled physical activity level in all groups. However, motor coordination level and BMI were not significantly correlated in normal weight adolescents when controlled for physical level. This evidence suggests physical activity level can influence the association between motor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents, but not in overweight and obese. These findings are in line with a previous study 22, corroborating the assump - tion that, in obese adolescents, motor coordination level BMI negatively associated of physical activity levels. These results can be explained by negative effect of excess body mass on motor coordination level; it overlap the possible influence that physical activity level exerts on the association between motor coordination and BMI in overweight and obese decline as weight status worsens. These results the of suggesting adolescents tend to some motor tasks experienced by individuals with higher BMI. Howe - ver, significant differences in motor coordination level were observed only between normal weight and obese groups. That is, there were no significant differences in motor coordination level when participants whose weight status was classified as overweight. In this study was hypothesized that the physical activity level, as a mediator mechanism, could influence the associations between motor coordination and in adolescents with different status. and obese, other complementary mechanisms, as percei - ved physical fitness, can have influenced the approached way our findings of physical activity Considering that opportunities for practice is essential for motor development 27, it is expected that physical activity level is associated with motor coordination. However, the levels of physical activity showed and opportunities Thus, of physical activity on relationship between motor coordination and BMI can be low or inexistent. In this sense, the role of physical activity as a mediator mechanism, such as proposed in the conceptual framework proposed by Stodden et al. 28, may vary in according to opportunities for practice experienced by individuals. This study had some limitations. First, motor coordination and phy - sical activity were assessed using a questionnaire, respectively. Thus, the inference of results is limited to these specific measures in adolescents. Second, both instruments used for assessing physical activity coordination our results. Conclusions Physical activity level influenced the association between mo - tor coordination and BMI in normal weight adolescents, but not in overweight and obese. The increased negative effects of excess body mass, as well as the variability of opportunities for practice according between coordination and BMI should be considered in future studies. As practical application, physical edu- cators and physicians must encourage not only a health weight status, but of for practice should also be promoted professionals, educators and physicians.

El objetivo de este estudio fue comparar dos protocolos (sin o con 15 minutos de calentamiento) para la determinaci\u00f3n de tlim al 100% de la Vpico en hombres no entrenados. Material y m\u00e9todo: Doce j\u00f3venes no entrenados realizaron tres pruebas de carrera en la cinta rodante: una prueba incre - mental m\u00e1xima para determinar Vpico y dos pruebas rectangulares, realizadas en orden aleatorio, sin calentamiento (tlim0) o con una duraci\u00f3n de calentamiento de 15 minutos (tlim15) al 60% de la Vpico para determinar el tlim al 100% de la Vpico; despu\u00e9s del calentamiento las pruebas fueron realizaradas en la velocidad de la Vpico individual hasta el agotamiento voluntario. Durante las pruebas, la frecuencia card\u00edaca (FC) y el grado de esfuerzo percibido (RPE) fueron monitorizadas y se tomaron muestras de sangre antes de la sesi\u00f3n (LApre); inmediatamente despu\u00e9s del ejercicio (LA0-min); 3 min (LA3-min), 5 min (LA5-min) y 7 min (LA7-min) despu\u00e9s del ejercicio para determinar las concentraciones de lactato. Se utiliz\u00f3 la prueba de Shapiro Wilk y se confirm\u00f3 la normalidad de la distribuici\u00f3n de los datos, con los valores m\u00e1ximos y subm\u00e1ximos comparados utilizando la prueba t de Student para muestras dependientes. Resultados: La duraci\u00f3n de la prueba en el t lim0 fue significativamente mayor que aquella en el tlim15 (P = 0.02). Adem\u00e1s, los diferentes protocolos de tlim influenciaron las respuestas subm\u00e1ximas de FC y RPE y no modificaron las concentraciones de lactato o las variables m\u00e1ximas (FCmax y RPEmax). Conclusiones: Estos resultados sugieren que la determinaci\u00f3n del tlim en la 100% de la Vpico sin calentamiento pr\u00e9vio lleva a una mayor duraci\u00f3n de la prueba em hombres no entrenados.Palabras clave: Carrera.

The aim of this study was to compare two protocols (without or with 15 minutes of warm-up) for the tlim determination at 100% of Vpeak in untrained men. Material and method: Twelve untrained young men performed three running tests on a treadmill: one maximal incremental test to determine Vpeak and two rectangular tests, performed in randomized order, without warm-up (tlim0) or 15-minute warm-up duration (tlim15) at 60% of Vpeak to determine the tlim at 100% of Vpeak, after the warm-up the tests were performed at the speed of the individual Vpeak until (RPE) were monitored to session immediately post-exercise (LA0-min); 3 5 (LA7-min) post-exercise to lactate Shapiro-Wilk test was used and confirmed the determination tlim at 100% of Vpeak without a prior warm-up led to a higher test heart rate and rating of perceived exertion Guilherme H.S.

Results from this study showed that peak active twitch torque was lower after the traditional than experimental WU when expressed as percentage of pre-warm-up amplitude, and Wingate test traditional which corresponds with impaired peak power out - put, and shorter and lower intensity WU permits a better performance. However, a recent study showed that warm-up duration (5, 10 or 15 minutes) modified the test duration (t lim) of untrained men in which the warm-up comprising 15 minutes led the participants to exercise for shorter time compared to other tlim protocols5. Since tlim is a variable that is used to determine the optimal stimulus durations in interval training 9-11, warm-up will directly impact this prescription. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of studies that analyzed the best duration of the warm-up5 and knowing the importance of warm-ups prior to exercise and that the duration modifies the t lim5, the aim of this study was to compare two protocols (without and with a 15-minute warm-up) for the tlim determination at 100% of Vpeak untrained men. Our hypothesis is that the tlim determi- ned without a warm-up will differ from that of the tlim performed with a 15-minute warm-up. Material and method Twelve untrained young men, not included in systematic running training programs, with training volume less than 20 km per week, volunteered to participate in this study. The 5-km running times re - ported by participants were between 25 and 35 minutes, with a pace between 8.6 and 12 kmh-1 ( 36.1 and 50.4 % of the world record). The main characteristics of the participants were: age 21.4 \u00b1 2.3 years, height 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 m, body mass 76.7 \u00b1 10.9 kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.2 \u00b1 2.8 kgm-2 and body fat 15.3 \u00b1 4.2%. Prior to testing, written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The experimental protocol was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Comittee (#1.262.502/2015) and appropriate standards for been followed. overview Participants tests on a motorized treadmill (Super ATL Inbrasport, Porto Alegre, Brazil), with the gradient set at 1%. In the first visit the evaluation of the anthropometric measurements was per - formed, and the participants were submitted to a maximal incremental test to determine Vpeak. After, in a randomized order, two rectangular tests with warm-up durations of 15 minutes and without warm-up were performed to determine the tlim at 100% of Vpeak. The tests were performed over 2 weeks, with each test separated from the other by 48 hours. For all tests, participants were instructed the maximal exercise test, to abstain from caffeine and alcohol and to refrain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before testing. Tests were conducted at the same time of the day, under normal conditions (temperature 20-22 a warm-up, comprised walking at 6 kmh-1 for three minutes, the continuous protocol started with a speed of 8 kmh-1 incremental test was cal - culated as the speed of the last complete stage added to the completed fraction of (t/T\u00d7speed increment) where Vcomplete is the running speed of the last complete stage, t the time in seconds sustained during the incomplete stage, and T the time in seconds required to complete a stage (i.e., 180 seconds), and speed incremental is the speed load increment. The maximal effort was deemed to be achieved if the incremental test met two of the following criteria: 1) LA peak 8 mmolL-1 14 of endurance-trained age-predicted 0.7 and 3) RPEmax 19 in the 6-20 Borg Scale16. Rectangular tests to determine the tlim at Vpeak The two rectangular tests differed only by presence or absence of the warm-up of 15 minutes. After the warm-up at 60% of Vpeak, the treadmill speed was quickly increased (in approximately 6 seconds) to the individual at 100% of Vpeak4. Participants were also encouraged to invest maximal effort time of permanency in this intensity was considered the t lim at 100% of Vpeak.Guilherme H.S. Kimura, et al.76 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):74-78Psychophysiological and physiological variables Before testing participants were familiarized with the 6-20 Borg scale16, which was to determine the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during the last 15 seconds the stages of Vpeak and every minute in tlim. The highest RPE value adopted (Polar RS800sd, Kempele, and in the last 10 seconds of each stage da Vpeak and every minute registered; the the lactate concentrations. These samples were collected before (LA pre) all exercise tests, after the incremental test at the third (LA3-min) and fifth (LA5-min) minutes, and at the end (LA0-min), at the LA3-min, LA5-min and seventh (LA7-min) minutes after the rectangular tests. For the LApre, the participants remained at rest for 15 minutes in a comfortable chair prior to the sampling procedure. For the LA 0-min blood sampled collection the participants remained standing lactate concentration (LA peak) was \u00b1 2%). Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD and were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software v. 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used and confirmed the normality of at Results The variables obtained during the exhaustion incremental test to the Vpeak = 12.7 \u00b1 1.2 kmh-1, test duration = 17.1 \u00b1 3.8 min, HRmax = 187 \u00b1 8.7 bpm, RPEmax = 19.8 \u00b1 0.5 and LApeak = higher than = 0.02). However, no significant difference was seen in the other variables. Comparisons between HR and RPE values obtained during for tlim determination are shown in Table 2. Only the minutes in which the participants remained throughout the two tests were analyzed. in the HR and RPE values until the fifth minute ( P 0.01), in the RPE value at the sixth minute (P = 0.04), and in HR value at seventh minute (P = 0.02). Discussion This study aimed to compare the two protocols (without and with a 15-minute warm-up) in the tlim determination at 100% of Vpeak in untrained men. The main finding of the present study was that the different protocols for the tlim determination had different test durations; Variables tlim0 tlim15 P Test duration (min) 9.4 \u00b1 2.2 6.0 \u00b1 2.0* 0.02 HRmax (bpm) 184 \u00b1 11.0 184 \u00b1 10.9 0.80 RPEmax (6-20, AU) 19.9 \u00b1 0.3 19.9 \u00b1 0.3 1.1 \u00b1 0.3 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 0.30 LA0-min (mmolL-1) 8.5 \u00b1 2.0 7.1 \u00b1 2.4 0.07 LA3-min (mmolL-1) 8.6 \u00b1 2.7 8.2 \u00b1 3.1 1.00 LA5-min (mmolL-1) 8.4 \u00b1 2.3 7.7 \u00b1 3.3 0.11 LA7-min (mmolL-1) 8.1 \u00b1 2.3 7.5 \u00b1 3.3 0.42 LApeak (mmolL-1) 9.5 \u00b1 the test; LA0-min: blood lactate concentration at the end of the test; LA3-min: blood lactate concentration at the third minute after the test; LA5-min: blood lactate concentration at the fifth minute after the test; LA7-min: blood lactate concentration at the seventh 159\u00b111.6 175\u00b110.3* 15.5\u00b12.4* 165\u00b110.9 180\u00b19.2* 16.9\u00b12.1* 170\u00b110.8 183\u00b19.2* compared with lim0.Time limit at peak speed without prior warm-up: Effects duration, heart rate and rating exertion77 Arch 2019;36(2):74-78in the of the 15-minute warm-up period led partici - pants to run for duration HR test but not modify lactate of omitted warm-up (tlim0). This is the first study to investigate performance in a protocol for determining t lim without a previous warm-up and compared it with the standard protocol (tlim15)4. Our results demonstrated that the runners participated for a longer duration in the protocol without a warm-up than in the protocol with a warm-up. This result was similar to those of Da Cruz et al. 5 and Bertuzzi et al.18, recreational al.5 reported a longer time in the protocol with a 5-minute warm-up longer than they did in the protocol with a 10-mi - nute warm-up. Thus, a longer showed a negative effect on test duration and may be a tiring factor prior to exercise. The longer warm-up duration seems to cause greater physiological wear in the participants at the beginning of the test as demonstrated by the higher values of HR and RPE in the t lim15 protocol than in the tlim0 protocol observed in study. addition seems to be was an tlim15 value of 4.5 \u00b1 1.3 minutes in trained runners, similar to that observed by Billat et al.4 (i.e., 5.01 \u00b1 0.9 minutes) in a study of trained runners that showed a shorter tlim duration than the results of our study for the tlim15 protocol (i.e., 6.0 \u00b1 2.0 minutes) as well as the study of Da Cruz et al.5 (i.e., 5.9 \u00b1 1.7 minutes) that evaluated untrained young males. These results show that it is possible to observe a difference in tlim duration despite use of the differences in participant fitness levels. Since tlim is a determine the optimal stimulus durations in interval training sessions9-11, this longer duration by a lack will directly impact this prescription. to prescribe interval training showed that if these sessions do not have the ideal duration, runners may not complete the training and/or show no improvement because the stimuli had a duration of 50% of tlim in vVO2max in the interval training sessions, and no differences were found in the aerobic variables associated with performance after 4 weeks of training. Similarly, some authors 11,22 tested different its respective tlim for individualized training with series of 60 and 75%; 60 and 70% of tlim in vVO2max, respectively. As a result, performance improvements were observed only for the groups that trained with the series duration at 60% of t lim in vVO2max. The results of these studies suggest that small changes in tlim duration can have impact on the training prescription. Thus, the correct choice tlim is important because the warm-up time will affect the tlim duration and, RPE the tlim0 protocol compared to the tlim15 protocol. A similar result was found by Da Cruz et al.5, who observed higher values for these variables in the with warm-up compared to protocols with 5- and can be explained by the increase in cardiovascular activity after exercises with > our one limitation that the determination of the Vpeak (and warm-up based on Vpeak) could led to intensities relative to the velocity of anaerobic thres - despite correlated no previous study the relation - ship between Vpeak to better understand how differences in relative intensities of vAT time limit performance. Conclusion Therefore, we conclude that the lack of a 15-minute warm-up, ba- sed on the protocol proposed by Billat et al.4, for determining tlim leads to longer 100% of Vpeak and modifies the responses during the test variables (HR, in untrained men. This result may impact or interfere with the of durations to evaluate the impact of use of time limits. Conflict of interest The authors do not of interest. 1.

The basal lipid profile, muscular fitness were evaluated and the basal metabolic rate (BMR) was calculated before the study. The lipid profile was evaluated before, immediately after and 12 hours after the specific exercise session. The results showed that there was no a statistical significant difference among all groups in plasma concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, in any of the evaluation moments (p> 0.05). After 12 hours of exercise session, the CE group decreased more VLDL concentrations than the RE group and control group (p <0.05).

The preventive role of RE could be due to their impact on the assimilation of lipids and the regulation of the pro- and the organism, and Only a few assessed how an RE session modifies the lipid markers in the blood aerobic exercises, currently known (CE), has been shown to have beneficial effects on the state of health and general physical condition if performed regu - larly in profile and general physical fitness in populations, such persons with obesity and postmenopausal women14. an anti-inflammatory immunological profile and direct on the blood vessel walls, thereby avoiding the dysfunction of the vascular endothelium physiological, metabolic and morphological changes are characterised by a fall in the level of physical activity, increased body mass index (BMI), a decrease in muscle mass (sarcopenia), a decrease triglyceride (TG) and LDL The inclusion of physical exercise in the life style of this population, may have a positive effect on a number of cardiovascular risk factors, such as a reduction in body fat and the acute regulation of some of the lipemia directed at determining the acute effect of an RE ses - sion and a CE session on the lipid profile of postmenopausal women, compared to a control group. Material and method This investigation corresponds to a quasi-experimental study based on the acute changes provided in two groups, two types of physical exercise with specific biochemical blood markers, compared to a control Subjects comprised a total of 32 postmenopausal women volunteers, workers from the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital Universitario Metro - politano in the city of Barranquilla, with an average age of 54.66 \u00b1 4.04 years, recruited through the occupational welfare women with no hormone replacement treatment. Excluded from the study were those women who had taken part in some type of resistance training during the 6 months prior to the study and those with a medical history of serious endocrine, me - tabolic and/or neuromuscular medicine. Before taking part, each of the subjects of the study was informed in accordance with the ethical standards of exercise sciences16, of the World Medical Association and of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Investigation and Ethics Committee of the Universidad Metropolitana de Barranquilla, Colombia. Experimental design The total number of study subjects (n=32) were randomly divided into 3 groups, two experimental groups who performed a session of resistance exercises (RE, n=11) and a session of concurrent exercises (CE, n=11), respectively; and a control group with no exercises with significant energy expenditure (CG, n=10). Prior to the experimental protocol, an appointment was made for the women for an initial assessment of the musculoskeletal variables (maximum dynamic force and lower-limb functional capacity), body composition (% the protocols described below. Maximum dynamic force In order to determine the maximum dynamic force of the women's different body segments, maximum repetition tests groups performing the resistance exercises on which the experimental groups were based. The maximum load for each subject was determined with no more than 5 tries with a 4-minute recovery between tries. Maximum dynamic force In order to determine the maximum dynamic force of the different body segments of the women, tests of a maximum repetition (1RM) were used for the muscular groups that perform the resisted exercises on which the experimental groups are based. The maximum load of each subject was determined with no more than 5 attempts with a recovery of 4 minutes between attempts. Assessment of the lower-limb functional capacity The 30 second test measures the functional capacity of the lower limbs. The test was follows: the initial posi - tion was seated in the centre of a chair (height 43 cm), with the back straight and the feet placed flat on the floor, shoulder width apart, the arms crossed at chest height, with an approximate angle of 90\u00ba flexion of the hip and knee. At a verbal signal, the participants stand up and then return to the initial seated position. Participants were encouraged to repeat this as many times as possible within a 30 second period. Anthropometric assessment, body composition and basal metabolic rate The anthropometric waist circumference, tape measure, SECA brand, according to the instructions set out in resolution 2465 of the Ministry of Health of Colombia17. The data were used to calculate the BMI. Using the bioelectrical was determined, calculating the percentage of body fat and lean mass. The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) was calculated with the Harris-Benedict formula, modified with the physical activity factor (+20%). BMR = [655.0955 + (9.5634 x weight in kg) + (1.8449 x height in cm) - (4.6756 x age in years)]. Monitoring and guiding nutritional behaviour On the day assessment , the study subjects were given a printed document and, prior to a detailed explanation by a nutritionist, they recorded their nutritional behaviour during the 3 days prior to performing the experimental protocol. This was for the purpose of com - pensating for any improbable lipid profile results, derived from consuming excessively high fat food. to redu alterations in the results obtained, derived from atypical dietary behaviour. On the day of the experimental protocol, the food intake was moni - tored, standardising the calorie consumption prior to doing the exercises to 60% of the BMR with a physical activity factor for each case. The strategy included breakfast (cereals fruit), snack (cereals) and lunch potatoes All the food was prepared, proportioned and monitored by a nutritionist. The aim of this procedure was to guarantee that, when performing the exercise lipid and in quantities for each individual case. The last food intake for each case was programmed at least 3 hours prior to the exercises, encouraging doing the exercises and after at least a 12-hour fast. The women in the groups went to the facilities of the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital Universitario Metropolitano in the morning, to have 5ml of blood drawn in order to determine the baseline lipid profile, which includes the analysis of the serum concen - trations of Total Cholesterol (TC), HDL, LDL, VLDL and TG. Experimental protocol In a maximum period of one week following the muscular fitness assessment, another appointment was scheduled with the study sub - jects, at 5:00 pm at the gym facilities of the Physiotherapy Department of the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital Universitario Metropolitano. On the subjects' arrival, the nutritionist initially authorised the exercise session for those women with no atypical eating disorders that could interfere followed the based nutrition monitoring document. Blood samples were drawn from the women by a bacteriological expert, for the assessment of the lipid profile before the exercise session, and then immediately after it ended and 12 hours later, the following morning (under fasting Immediately after being drawn, the blood samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis. The exer - cise sessions for each experimental group and the control group are described below: Exercise protocol The subjects of the RE group did a 10 minute warm-up consisting in walking (5 min) and general joint mobilization (5 min). Following this, they performed a total of 8 resistance exercises (1. Leg Press; 2. Machine knee extension; 3 Machine knee flexion; 4 Elbow flexion with dumb - bells; 5 Elbow with dumbbells; 6 Shoulder adduction with in position; and 8. Push-ups with free weight), each one with 3 sets and each set with 15 reps, with an intensity of 75% of MR1. The approximate total duration of this session was 40 minutes. The CE group initially performed a 10 minute warm-up consisting in walking (5 min) and general joint mobilization (5 min), followed by the same exercises as for the RE group, except for the fact that each exercise was only performed for a set with 15 reps, at 75% of MR1. Subsequently, the subjects performed 20 of continuous dalling on a cycle ergometer at a frequency of between 70 to 80% of the maximum heart rate. The approximate total duration of this exercise session was 40 minutes.Roberto et al.82 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):79-85On the implicit instructions of the ethics and scientific committee of the Universidad Metropolitana de Barranquilla, those subjects forming part of the Control Group (CG) ought to do some exercises to promote their physical health, from any point of view. It was therefore decided to get the members of this group to perform a set of passive stretching exercises, which were have on the lipid metabolism18. The session comprised a 10 minute warm-up (5 mi - nutes free walk and 5 minutes of joint mobilization) and 30 minutes of directed stretching. The average duration of this session was 40 minutes. At the end of each exercise session, the subjects were instructed to with no until following sample was taken correspon - ding to 12 hours after the exercise session. Statistical analysis A descriptive and comparative statistical analysis was performed with measurements of with standard deviations. test used and the Levene test of homogeneity. The considering this analyses. Results The results of initial assessment of the women showed that the randomisation did not lead to any significant difference between any of the groups and for none of the performance variables before executing the experimental protocol (Table 1). For the total number of women, the BMI ranged from 25.02 to 37.58, ranging from 25 to 30 in 23 women, greater than 30 for 8 women considered to have type I obesity and only one woman had a BMI of more than 35, considered to have type II obesity. The distribution of women with obesity was balanced in the three groups. The waist circumference value ranged between 84 to 110 cm, with all the women with abdominal obesity coming within the criteria established by resolution 2465 of 201617. The average values of the variables analysed in the initial evaluation of the women for the total population and for each of the experimental and control groups are set out in Table 1. The statistical comparison of the average values between the expe - rimental groups, of the variables of the baseline lipid profile under fasting conditions and at each of the times established in the experimental protocol (before, immediately after and 12 hours after exercise), showed no significant variations (p>0.05) in the exercise sessions performed by the RE and CE groups in relation to total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL. The assessment of the VLDL levels was statistically significant and was lower for the women in the CE group 12 hours after the exercise session, compared to the RE and CG groups. After 12 hours post-exercise, the HDL levels were also seen to be statistically higher in the CE group in relation to the RE group (Table 2). Table collected 12 hours after the corresponding exercise session. No statistical differences were found for any of the variables in the comparison of averages in relation to times (p>0.05). The average with the greatest variation in the CT analysis was that of the CG, dropping 10.1%, followed by the RE group and CE with drops of 9.8% and 3.5% respectively.

The HDL trend in the post-exercise analysis was to increase for all groups. Discussion For each individual, the lipid metabolism at is on many factors, including diet, the physical health condition and the daily energy expenditure. This study aimed to demonstrate the influence of the different types of physical exercise considered, in a population of postmenopausal women with similar immediately post-exercise and 12 hours post-exercise) between the experimental groups. In addition, it attempted to show the possible influence of physical within each Although it clear that the in - fluence of physical exercise is not the only determining factor in the lipid profile variations, given that, depending clarify that, although there are limitations with regard to the control of the biolo - gical and behavioural and other energy substrates. analyses of the results of this study are based on the acute responses of the types, levels and intensities of physical exercise con - sidered on the lipids found in the blood plasma. These responses have not been fully clarified for postmenopausal women, a that suffering The interpretation responses at times that are subsequent to the scheduled performance of physical exercise is makes build a useful description of the physiology of the human body, endeavouring to support the notion that argues the benefits of physical exercise not only when it is being performed but also subsequently, during a period of physiological recovery reorganisation. in the literature associate regular physical exercise with changes in the metabolic and variables, 9,19. changes in the BMI, weight and percentage of fat, it is necessary to implement long-term exercise programs. This is a limiting factor in this study, given that a single exercise session does not produce changes in body composition. However, it has been observed that a single exercise session con modify the lipid of The systematic implementation for more than 8 weeks, has shown findings associated with the reduction in serum concentrations TG and LDL, as although results from other studies differ, such as the study by Kelley et al.21, in which it is alleged that in different RE periods (for example, between 8 to 20 weeks) there are no changes in the lipoprotein concentrations in the blood plasma. With regard to the acute effects of one exercise session, these effects are primarily associated with increased HDL concentrations. In a study on healthy adult men, Wallace et al. 22 reported a 12% increase in HDL plasma concentrations within the first 24 hours following a high volume and moderate intensity session of RE (7 exercises of 3 sets and 12 reps at 80% of the maximum strength), as well finding a 20% reduction in TG concentrations for the same period. Very similar results were found in this present study, a 13.6% increase in HDL was recorded for the RE group in relation to its baseline records, not finding any great changes in the TG levels 12 hours after exercise. Compared to the control group, the RE group subjects showed no differences in modifications of LDL and HDL, refuting the findings of the study made by Correa et al. 23 in which high or low volume resistance exercises did not reduce the TC concentrations in postmenopausal women, neither did they affect the LDL and VLDL levels, both with re - gard to baseline values and the postprandial needed taking account of of resistance exercises with regard to volume, intensity, number of exercises, groups of mus - cles, recovery intervals and speed of contraction, may show divergent results for alternative combinations to those considered in this study. A marked trend in the lipid profile results before and immediately after the exercise session was that none of the variables showed an intra-group statistical difference. However, 12 hours and resistance exercises showed differences with the RE and control group, with a significant reduction in VLDL of approximately 22% in relation to the baseline records during fasting for the same group. It appears that aerobic exercises have a better impact al. 5 reported that 12 hours after performing a session of aerobic exercises, the TG concentrations could be reduced by 8.5% while the HDL concentrations could be increased by 5%. In this study, the scope of the variation in TG and HDL within the CE group showed better results than in the aforementioned study, with a 13% reduction in TG and an increase in HDL up to 16.7%, 12 hours after performing the exercises. This finding may be an indicator that the combination of aerobic and anaerobic cises do not stimulate the formation of HDL, due to the fact that reverse mobilisation of lipids (towards the requires the of These are very similar results to those reported in the studies by Wooten et al. 24 and Zotou et al.25, postprandial lipid postmenopausal women, the high volumes of these exercises did not show positive modifications in the HDL blood concentrations. There are many authors who have not only mentioned a reduction in the levels of physical activity as a crucial factor in increasing the car - diovascular risk in postmenopausal women, in overweight women. According to the Ameri - can College of Sports Medicine, the regular performance of resistance exercises may improve the overall physical health of women, and help prevent and treat cardiovascular risk related disorders, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Therefore, these exercises, monitored by a spe - cialist, part rehabilitation and physical fitness programs, directed at this population 26. that describes the metabolic women, although studies as 19 and Libardi et al.27 show positive effects on the control of cardiovascular risk factors when this type of exercise is performed in the long term. Based on the most important findings of this study, it is possible to start to consider the idea of the combined performance of resistance exercises, in blood lipid profile which, in the long become a protective factor against suffering CVD. Based on the analysis of the results of this study, we can conclude that, in comparison to the performance of a session of resistance exer - cises, a session of of do declare interest. irillo 2 .

Estudios en el campo de entrenamiento son escasos. Objetivo: Documentar la tasa de sudoraci\u00f3n, rehidrataci\u00f3n y temperatura central (Tc) durante entrenamiento para deportes de tipo continuo (CON) e intermitente (INT), y determinar presencia de mutaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica en el gen CFTR en atletas con alta concentraci\u00f3n de sodio ([Na+]) en sudor. Metodolog\u00eda: Se evalu\u00f3 la tasa de sudoraci\u00f3n, la [Na+] en sudor, la Tc, y el nivel de deshidrataci\u00f3n en atletas (CON =50; INT =123) durante entrenamiento en clima tropical, y la presencia de la mutaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica F508 en el gen CFTR en aquellos con alta [Na+] en sudor. Resultados: La tasa de sudoraci\u00f3n fue mayor en CON (1,5 \u00b1 0,4 L/h) comparado con INT (1,2 \u00b1 0,5 L/h) y los atletas en CON terminaron el entrenamiento con mayor deshidrataci\u00f3n (2,1 \u00b1 0,8 vs 1,2 \u00b1 0,7%) P < 0,05. La [Na +] en sudor fue m\u00e1s alta en INT (62,0 \u00b1 21,1 mmol/L) comparado con CON (53,9 \u00b1 18,1 mmol/L), P < 0,05. Un tenista con alta [Na+] era heterocigoto para la mutaci\u00f3n F508. La Tc promedio y m\u00e1s alta fueron similares para CON (38,4 \u00b1 0,3 y 38,8 \u00b1 0,4 oC) e INT (38,3 \u00b1 0,3 y 38,7 \u00b1 0,4 oC), P > 0,05. Conclusi\u00f3n: Durante el entrenamiento en clima tropical, la p\u00e9rdida de sudor y el nivel de deshidrataci\u00f3n son m\u00e1s bajos, y la ingesta de l\u00edquido es m\u00e1s alta en deportes intermitentes que en deportes continuos. La temperatura interna puede aumentar a nivel similar en deportes intermitentes debido a periodos repetidos de alta intensidad y/o la vestimenta usada durante el entrenamiento. Atletas saludables con alta [Na +] en sudor que son heterocig\u00f3ticos para mutaciones de CFTR pueden estar en mayor riesgo de deshidrataci\u00f3n hiponatr\u00e9mica y calambres musculares.Palabras clave: Sudoraci\u00f3n. in hot conditions in the laboratory.

The risk is higher if athletes begin training in a state of body fluid deficit and do not drink enough during exercise to losses 2. 2 L/h are common during training and competition in hot and humid tropical environments and may reach or exceed 2.5 L/h heavy sweaters. Heat acclimatized elite athletes with high sweat production that train for long duration-continuous type (CON) sports, are most prone to dehydration. Athletes in intermittent type (INT) sports, such as team, ball and combat sports, are also at risk since multiple high intensity time periods elevate metabolic heat pro - duction and core temperature and induce heavy sweating 3. This may be particularly in athletes evaporation of sweat. Athletes with high sweat rates are more susceptible to large electro - lyte losses in sweat, which have been implicated in the of skeletal muscle cramps 4. Athletes born and raised in be protected from large sweat Na+ levels like those of patients8. that some healthy \"salty sweaters,\" are heterozygous for a CF mutation of high sweat [Na+]10. In the United States, the most common mutation in the CFTR gene associated to the development of CF is the deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508) 11 and exercise with periods of exercise (15 minutes) may elicit similar or higher heat storage, core temperature (Tc), and sweat production, as constant intensity no rest 3,12-14,.

Discussion The present study examined the body hydration status and thermoregulatory responses to tropical conditions in athletes sports. The main findings were: 1) sweat rate and the change in core temperature were higher CON compared to INT; 2) in proportion exhibit \"salty and was a carrier of a CFTR gene mutation; and 4) athletes in INT exhibited maximal T c similar to athletes in CON who trained at high intensity for longer periods. Hydration status and fluid balance Athletes in our study indigenous to and have physiological adaptations induced by exposure increased capacity values in males (1.6 \u00b1 0.4 L/h) and females (1.3 \u00b1 0.3 L/h) in CON and in males in INT (1.5 \u00b1 0.4 L/h) in the present study are higher than type laboratory-based soccer protocol in male athletes ran on a treadmill for 45 minutes either intermittently (7.5 min exercise/1.2 min rest) or continuously in a thermoneutral en - vironment. In al. 3 of variable high intensity/4.5 min low intensity) compared to same amount of work performed at a constant load in endurance-trained, heat-acclimated males exercising in hot-dry environment. In the present field study, in which we did not control for exercise intensity or environmental con - ditions, we found higher rates in athletes in CON which may be expected for two reasons: 1) a greater proportion of the CON sessions were at high exercise intensity; and 2) athletes in CON were exposed to a higher heat stress. Our data are consistent with the thus, they are hypohydrated at the end of training 24. In CON sports opportunities to drink may be frequent but athletes may be reluctant to drink, to avoid slowing down and the abdominal discomfort associated with large fluid consumption. On the other hand, in intermittent type opportunities for 1 mg. cm-2. min-1. In the present study athletes in letes INT, which may be attributed to their higher level of heat exposure advantage [Na +] is a for developing hyponatremia during exercise in the excretion in healthy athletes is the presence of genetic mutations in the CFTR that affects the Cl- channel in the sweat tion and exhibit [Na+] in their sweat be up to five times higher than healthy individuals26. It is estimated that 2% (1 in 46) of Hispanic Americans are heterozygous carriers of a mutated CFTR active study, none of the subjects was a carrier of any of the 39 most common CFTR mutations in the United States. The authors concluded that a full CFTR gene sequencing Na loss in sweat and CFTR mutations. A novel finding of our study was that one of 45 Hispanic athletes (2%), classified as \"salty sweaters\" was heterozygous for the mu - tation in the CFTR gene. That athlete was a tennis player with a history of whole body muscle cramps that lead to when the same amount of exercise is performed in a variable intensity mode that includes short (1.5 to 7.5 min) high in - tensity bouts followed by rest periods if min) of high intensity ex - ercise are used, a similar Tc rise is observed28,29. We found that although athletes in INT spent the majority of the lower with resting periods, they exhibited a maximal T c (38.7 \u00b1 0.4 oC) similar to athletes in CON (38.8 \u00b1 0.4 oC) who trained at high exercise intensity for most of the session. This response suggests that the heat stored during the few periods of high exertion was not significantly and previous report30, judokas in the present study arrived to training with a fluid deficit, as evidenced by USG. The combination to of the 9 judokas felt overheated and 7 of them had maximal T c 39.0 oC. Sweating and core temperature in athletes training in continuous and intermittent sports in tropical climate91 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):86-91Two athletes reached a Tc of 39.6 oC and felt dizzy, had a headache, and stopped training with symptoms of exhaustion. High Tc and increased strain have reported in American football athletes a full uniform while training in similar climatic conditions15. We believe this to be the first study documenting the rate of Tc rise in judo athletes during training in the heat. Our data indicate that training in full uniform in a non-air conditioned in This observational field study that training in a tropical climate, sweat loss and dehydration level are lower, Nonetheless, core temperature may rise to a similar level in intermittent type sports due to the repeated high intensity bouts and/or the effects For in high sweat rates may for their enthusi - astic participation in the study, research assistants Jos\u00e9 Qui\u00f1ones, Javier R\u00edos, Eddie Rodr\u00edguez, and David Col\u00f3n, and medical personnel at the Center for Sports Health and Exercise Sciences for their help during testing.

This study aimed to investigate of Nigella sativa on randomly divided into two control and exercise groups and 19 subgroups. The exercise group carried out a period of six weeks of undulating IIET followed by three weeks of load reduction performed by three models in two different times. Rats entered the taper phase were administrated by NS supplement in tapering and control groups. The lung tissue samples were processed by standard paraffin embedding, through systematic sampling The results were analyzed using by two-way that increase inflammatory cells and lymphocytes was considerably and similarly more in comparison to the basic and control groups ( p=0.001). Ste - reological analysis in the taper exercise training groups with NS and without NS as well, reveled a significant decrease in the degree and intensity of lung tissue inflammation in the examined times in comparison to the IIET group ( p=0.001). Conclusion: Generally it can be concluded that performing NS and a three weeks period of tapering has a noticeable effect in the reduction Sciences. University of Mazandaran. Babolsar.

Increase in the volume and intensity of the exercise training along with a decrease in the recovery time may cause an overtraining in athletes and affect their immune system3. On the other hand, physical exercise can be a strong stimulus in the development of lung inflammation4. Findings of several studies shows that exercise training load beyond the normal range increases the risk of upper respiratory tract in the most of the elite athletes are similar to general population6, however, usual seasonal patterns of URTI are not seen in these athletes7. It is found out that short and long term physical exercise trainings with too much inflammation causing severe damage to can be life-threat - ening10, it seems necessary One of the hardest challenges for sport science researchers and trainers is considered to determine the training intensity reduction programs in order to improve their reports suggest the favorable time period for taper is between 4 to 28 days or even more8,13. Though many studies have confirmed a two-week period taper, have been some reports on the improvement of athletes' performance due to very short or very long period tapers19. Thomas et al.3 concluded that the optimal time duration for taper depends on the training before the taper and no particular time limit can be specified for that. Today, there are several these plants, Nigella sativa L (NS) is a medicinal plant known in Iranian traditional medicine. This native plant has been used for the treatment of headaches, nasal congestion, asthma, system20,21. The ratio in overtrained animals. showed that this effect of NS is more pronounce d in overtraining animals than control or high intensity of taper and NS use during maturation period as to the inflammatory response of the lung did not come to a clear conclusion, this study was designed to investigate NS on the tissue during maturation period. Material study, 95 male Wistar rats with an approximate age of 3 weeks and an average weight of 68\u00b19 g were obtained from Pasteur Institute of Iran. In order to adaptation, animals (5 rats per cage) were maintained in transparent % light/ dark cycle for two week. Throughout all stages of the study, ethics of working with laboratory animals such as free access to standard pellet diet and libitum were into consideration according to recommendations about laboratory animals' researches, ratified in Helsinki and updated in 2008 by the American Physiology. After one weeks of familiarity with laboratory and manipulation, the rats were randomly divided into two control and exercise groups matched for their weight. Exercise training program The rats were divided into two control and exercise groups at first. Then, for getting acquainted with the treadmill, they performed the main pattern training including increasing interval training (IIT) but with a lower intensity for two weeks. After one week period of getting acquainted with the environment and the treadmill, they performed increasing interval undulating exercise training for six weeks and that was followed by 3 weeks of load reduc - tion (taper) carried out by 3 models in two different times. Treatment and un-treatment with NS supplement after 6 weeks increasing interval exercise training, the first and third week of tapering, the animals were divided into 19 groups and each group included 5 rats. The familiarity and compatibility phase included 4 sessions of in - terval exercise training per week with the speed of 10 to 25 meters per minute and the slope of zero percent lasting for 15 to 30 minutes. The increasing interval exercise training program was carried out in the form of 10 repetitions of 1 minute length and active rests of 2 minute length minutes in such a way that the total daily workout time for each rat was 30 minutes-long. The animals started the increasing interval exercise training at the speed of 25 m/min and ended it at the speed of 70 m/ min26. Apart from the main activity, warm -Shadmehr Mirdar, et al.94 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):92-99ing up and 5 minutes for cooling down. This program was conducted in 6 weeks and each week included 6 sessions scale of 0.001 precision and then was soaked in 30% distilled water mixed with 70% ethanol solution for 72 hours. During this period, the container of the solution was well sealed with paraffin and was kept at 20 to 25 \u00baC room temperature. The mixture was stirred with a glassy rod every six hours. After this period, the mixture was filtered through Whatman filter removed by mild temperature rotary (under 60 \u00b0C). Control and NS tapering groups was treated by extract via oral gavage at a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight. Tissue sampling and histological studies At the end of six week period of increasing interval exercise training, and at the end of the first and the third week of tapering (Table 3), the anim als were euthanized with a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), intraperitoneally and left lung was removed and fixed in a 10% buffered formalin solution. Lung tissue samples were dehydrated by passing a graded series and cleared by xylene and impregnated by paraffin. Tissue processing was done by histokinette 2000 (Lica, Germany) and samples were em - bedded in paraffin blocks. Then, 20 to 25 non-serial 5 sections each analysis least microscopic each section were and unbiased stereological stud a version 9 stereo-investigator system software (MBF Bioscience, Micro Bright Field, Inc., Germany). In each microscopic field, 0.016 mm2 of lung tissue were of inflammatory cell presence. A value of 0 was assigned when no inflammation was detectable, a value of 1 was adjudged for occ asional cuffing with inflammatory cells, a 2 when most bronchi or vessels were surrounded by a thin layer (one to Table 1.

Total lung inflammation was defined as the average of the peribronchial and perivascular inflammation scores28. All analyses were carried out by one evaluator who was blinded to the treatment groups. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 21. For the analysis of normal distribution of data, Kolmog - orov-Smirnov test and for the comparison of the variables among groups, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by LSD post hoc test were data expressed as null hypothesis. Results The study of histological structure of lung tissue has revealed that the lung parenchyma was normal in both control and basic groups (Figure 1-A and B). Structural integrity of lung tissue in taper groups treated by NS was greater and better than in the taper groups without NS. Furthermore, among the groups with NS, the third week taper groups had a better structure and a more integrated alveolus wall. The results investigations showed that IIT of infiltration of inflammatory cells and lymphocytes into the the lung tissue 1-D to taper groups , this damage was less in the groups with NS, but the relative inhibitory effect of all threetaper types were rather to 1-I). Among these groups, the taper group treated with NS in the third week showed a better improvement in comparison to the other groups. As it is shown in Figure 2, results indicated that the severity of lung tissue inflammation in control groups increased until the second week of tapering (age of 13 weeks) and then decreased. The severity of lung tissue inflammation in control groups without NS increased as similarly and significantly as in the basic and interval control groups (age of 11 weeks), ( p=0.002). A similar and significant increase of inflammation has also been observed in the second week control animals with NS comparing with the basic and interval control groups ( p=0.02). There was not a significant difference in the severity of lung tissue inflammation in the second week taper groups (age of 14 weeks) with and without NS comparing with the basic group (respectively p= 0.07 and and the most in lung (grade 3) and the occurrence this inflam- mation was similarly and significantly more frequent in comparison to the control and basic groups. The results showed that the implementation of the studied times in comparison to interval training (Figure 4). After two weeks of frequency, repetition and intensity tapering, the degree of 49 and 52 percent respectively interval training and this decrease continued until the third week of the tapering (51, 52 and Figure 1.

The evaluation of the time effect on lung tissue inflammation showed that lung tissue inflammation was reduced 27, 6 percent respectively in the frequency, repetition and intensity taper groups of the third week compared to the second week (Figure 4). This hydro-alcoholic extract use (as the implementation of patterns of taper revealed the same amount of decrease in lung tissue inflammation as the groups without NS (Figure 5). The frequency, repetition and intensity groups, with a decrease of respectively 61%, 75% and 72% in the second week and a decrease of 77%, 82% and 80% in the third week, showed a similar and significant decrease in lung with interval exercise training group ( p=0.001). In of the time effect, a decrease of 43%, 28% and 30% in lung tissue inflammation was observed in the third week frequency, repetition and intensity taper groups compared to the second week taper groups. This change was of the present study showed that the degree of lung tis - sue inflammation in all taper groups was significantly groups. As it shown in Figure 6, the use of hydro-alcoholic extract of NS in the taper groups could decrease amount of lung tissue inflammation repetition and intensity groups treated with NS in the second week decreased Figure 3.

In short, it can be concluded that the increasing interval exercise along and using the hydro-alcoholic extract of NS in a time period of three weeks had the most decrease in lung tissue inflammation. Discussion This study analyzed of lung tissue caused by inflammation in it through im - plementation of a period of increasing changes in the control groups can indicate changes in the lung tissue during maturation period, this was designed to analyze the maturation process as well. The age range for the research protocol was 5-14 weeks. According to Sengupta14 this age range in rats is equivalent to the age range years old in humans. Therefore the male rats in the control groups, treated and untreated with NS, were in their maturation period in the second week of tapering. It is assumed that the significant increase of lung tissue inflammation in these groups is due to being in the critical period of maturation which is related to developmental changes and lymphoid cells into it. Although the amount of lung tissue inflammation in different periods and different patterns has decreased in animals both treated and untreated with NS hydro-alcoholic extract, but it is still significantly higher in comparison to the basic and control groups. It is concluded that this is because of the downfall of immune system which occurs following period of time5. Although several different studies have been done about the influ - ence of high intensity exercise on the immune system and the inflam - matory factors in the body, but this study is unique for the microscopical analysis it makes on the influence of high intensity exercise on the immune system of lung tissue and occurrence of inflammation in it, using histolog - ical and stereological methods. A few studies been done about the effects of high intensity exercise on immune system function the acute and inflammatory responses and the call of into the spreadable of inflammation in the lung29. Michna et al.30 observed that, after a period of training, the immigrant peritoneal macrophages of humans and mice had a better catalytic role in many macrophage functions. On rate by induction of inflammation. Our research revealed that six weeks in of Ramel et al.35, Murphy et al.36 and neutrophils, while this has observed in low intensity physical activities. Some studies showed that, the function of lymphocytes, in periods, to the increase of exercise intensity in function of circulation of stress hormones, especially cortisol, and change balance or anti-inflammatory cytokines when responding to the exercise training38. In a study conducted on 18 swim - mers on the national level and 11 healthy untrained volunteers, it was found out and season. The results of this study the idea exercise to increases the inflammation in their respiratory mucosa41. it of innate and high intensity exercise training, weakens the immune system of the lung tissue. The reported severity of inflammation in the lung tissue of IIT animals in this study also confirms this possibility. reduction of a gradual reduction in the load of exercise can be recommended by the sport trainers to the athletes as an appropriate approach13. The results taper (frequency, the lung tissue inflammation caused by intensive exercise but the in - flammation was still significantly higher in comparison to the control group after 3 weeks of taper. Regarding the time effect of the taper, the implementation a in two-week taper. this study were in line with previous studies3,42. Mujica et al .42, having 6-day taper in the middle-distance runners improved the performance in 800 meter runners16. Two weeks taper in triathletes43, one week taper in rugby league players44,45 and two weeks taper in judo athletes11 resulted in increased T/C ratio and improved performance. It can be concluded that the recovery or the enhancement of immune system function during taper intensive exercises3. On the other hand, by the increase of volume and intensity of train - ing other than increased risk of sport injuries and URTI development. One of these concerns is the increasing tendency of athletes to take sport medicines and chemical supplements, some of which are completely ineffective in long term use3. Herbal drugs and natural treatment (complementary treatment) with fewer side effects and multiple properties can be the best alternative for athletes46. In the last three decades, extensive research has been done on the biological effects of NS seeds. In pointed out47. One of the special of NS exercise training been in this study. While the implementation of different patterns of taper reduced the lung tissue but extracts use enhanced this reduction. Although the amount of lung tissue inflammation in the animals significantly decreased in all three types of taper treated with NS, in comparison to their counterparts, but the implementation of three weeks of intensity taper accompanied NS hydro-al use, effective in the cellular properties, suppression of inflammatory mediators such as and few studies that examine the effect of taper lung tissue safety mechanism during maturation The of increase of interval training intensity has been undulating and gradual but the immune system of the lung tissue is not able to cope with that and it causes severe inflammation in the lung tissue. This problem during pre-maturation period may have a negative effect on the performance of the athletes and the results of the competition or even negative effects on the future of their sport. Our results indicated that the implementation of three types of taper decreases the lung tissue inflammation induced by IIT. It can be concluded that a reduction in the load of exercise alone can compensate for the induced weakness, or enhance immune function so that tissue inflammation But since the interactive effect of NS hydro-alcoholic use and taper was more effective in the reduction of lung tissue inflammation, we can conclude that reducing the exercise load accompanied by NS hydro-alcoholic extract use associated with particular anti- inflammatory properties, has a more prominent role in safety mechanism of lung tissue. Thus the implementation of taper along with NS hydro-alcoholic extract use will enhance the immune system of the tissue during maturation period and subsequently reduces the induced damages. It may also make the sport life span longer. Decrease of the intensity or frequency of the exercise load is a good pattern for taper program. However the results of the study revealed that the implementation of 3 weeks taper is more effective in the reduction of lung tissue inflammation than 2 weeks taper. It suggested factors studied.

For (T) and its have the substitution of the first choice in clearly defined clinical conditions. When it comes to pharmaceutical development, there are large number of effective and safe T formulations on the market which provide a very good patients' compliance. Regarding clinical application well-documented, general is that both users of AS and clinicians should know more about the risks of their use.This review points to the need of better information and more comprehensive education at different levels, as well as im-plementation of additional preventive strategies, population, in order to avoid potentially serious consequences the status of lifestyle drugs - are we for Diseases ''Brezovik'' .

Later, at schools and faculties of health care, students learn about diseases excessive secretion. Medical doctors and pharmacists know most about A as medicines, while other professions, as well as the general public, know very superficially or to the extent of their own needs or interests. As with many other medicines, some indications for A use are unquestionable and generally accepted from both clinicians and regulatory bodies, while others are still waiting for valid evidence. However, unlike most other drugs it different substances with androgenic actions were used by people without any medical diagnosis, in order to increase muscle mass, strength and en - durance 1-4. Available data show that those were first German soldiers1, later Russian and American athletes2,3, and since the eighties of the last century these substances have \"entered\" into the widest population physical mass have basic life preoccupation4. In official literature these Possible risks and consequences death, are well- documented6-8. The extent and importance of this problem is indicated by the data that in some countries, such as Netherlands, an outpatient clinic for past and current users of those substances was established in 2011 in order to acquire more knowledge about the health risks associated with anabolic androgenic steroids abuse 9. The objective of this review was to evaluate critically and in detail the current cognition about A physiology, their pharmaceutical deve - lopment and place in modern medicine. Special aspect was to explore the reasons and potential use for non-medical purposes as so-called LD and to point out the importance of better education and preventive strategies in Methods literary sources were used Initial data were obtained from textbooks, monographs sports The inclusion criteria for these publications were the following: a publication of a newer date which is internationally recognized (or used in university teaching), written in English and issued by a renowned publisher. Older date publications that are not of an international character and not published in English were not taken into account. For a more detailed insight into individual of review, we searched \"PubMed\" database, using a number of keywords criteria for inclusion were the following: publication had to be original scientific paper or review (including studies on animals and other types of experimental studies) published in English in the period 2000-2018. Priority exceptional cases, older papers were quoted, where this was of substantial importance for the research sub - ject. Case studies, papers without the author's name and papers which weren't written in English were not taken into consideration. The last source of The November 2018. Androgens as physiologically important substances - can we live without them? Testosterone (T) is a major natural A. It is mostly synthesized in testicular Leydig's cells and adult male, 4-9 mg of T is excreted daily and only 1-2% is free in plasma10. Androgenic effects of T are spermatogenesis and development of and secondary sexual characteristics of a man, including characteristic development, basal me - tabolism, increased number the and adrenal cortex in both sexes. In the liver they are being converted into more potent T of skeletal and doping17, existing data doesn't their effectiveness regarding muscle strength or performance improvement compared with placebo 18,19 (Figures 1 and 2). In most peripheral tissues T is being converted in more active dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5alpha-reductase. Inhibitors of this en - zyme and being traditionally used of dehydroepiandrosterone.Androgens from physiology, through pharmacy and pharmacology to the status of lifestyle drugs - are we going in the right direction?103 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):101-108treatment of benign prostatic hepatic encephalopathy This could expand the existing knowledge about A physiology and open new possibilities in the treatment of some CNS diseases. Paba al.25 identified the 5alpha-reductase as novel therapeutic target in the treatment of schizophrenia. Androgens as medicines - is the science fully dedicated exclusively to the well-being of the patient? There have always been pathological states that have caused a lack or complete absence of A in the body of a man, with accompanying clinical manifestations. In that sense, it was imposed the need for desig - ning and synthesizing substances million in USA aged 40-69 years old suffer from hypogonadism26. About 2.3% of men in their 40s and 3.8% of men in their 60s were taking some form T replacement orally is the subject of so- called ''metabolism of the first pass'' through liver to a extent14, Butenandt and Ruzicka synthesized T in the injection for the first time in 1935, that is considered as the beginning of the golden age of steroid chemistry. Four years later these scientists got the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1. However, T administered even in this way had a short duration of action due to intense biotransformation (half-life of 10 minutes)28, so patients were forced receive it frequently. In order to ensure the prolonged action of T, the science went on. In the 1940s and 1950s, the first T esters were synthesized (propionate, cypionate, enanthate). These esters are still in use and they are administe - red as intramuscular depot injection at intervals of weeks, according to patients individual requirement29,30. In the mid-seventies there was a new progress. It was synthesized T undecanoate, also T ester in the form of depot intramuscular injection10. It has provided stable plasma levels of T over three months, which has been a significant advantage for patients31 (Figure 3). Certainly, the revolutionary discovery of the 1980s was transdermal application of T as an alternative to painful injection28. The first effective transdermal patches were pharmacokinetics potency area well as the apparence of transdermal patches which could be applied at back, abdomen, upper arms or thighs limited the use of formulations for scrotum application 29. discoveries went absorption10. In order to minimize transfer, recommended sites for their application are areas which will be covered by clothing29. There are also formulations for application to which T gradually absorbed, provide the replacement of T for a period of even 6 months29. The latest discovery was nasal gel, as another non-invasive treatment29. Synthetic androgens There were improve the possibility of clinical application of SA, that can be considered justified from the professional, scientific and ethical point of view. Oral activity was achieved by substitution of the 17 -H on the steroid nucleus with a methyl by first-pass in the liver 12. Methyltestosterone was the first synthesized medicine in this group (1935), and others were synthesized later 17. However, the attempt structural of A was 5 - reduction. Mesterolone was synthesized in this way, but it's oral LART limited due to liver However, the third goal (very high ratio of anabolic to androgenic action12 was achieved with N, that could be an explana - tion for its current status of the most popular A in sports doping and bodybuilding35 (Figure 4). Figure 2. Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):101-108In its medical application, there were developed long-acting pro-drug esters of N (but not for intramuscular injection again!), such positive effects of ND on bone et al. found ND blocked bone loss by inhibition effect on bone callus formation after of Osteoporosis40, as drugs of the first choice. what the therapy is in as the result of disturbance on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Another reason for T clinical use is delayed puberty in boys ages 16 and older10. Substitution of T in aging men in andropause, according to some authors41-43 has a positive effect on bone mineral density and lean mass, sexual function, mood, general sense of well-being and reduction of the amount of adipose tissue. Considering between deficiency''. Before commencing T as consider the assessment of prostate and other factors female still unresolved45. T therapy is not approved for women in North America46. In EU, T-containing medicines are licensed only for Additio - naly, the long-term side effects of T in women have not yet been fully investigated48,45. Due to relatively weak anabolic conditions. hypogonadism as the consequence of the AIDS17. Rabkin JG et al. found in their double- blind, placebo-controlled trial that T is effective and well tolerated in the short-term treatment of with symp HIV in physiological doses that are used therapy, A administered in therapy. used diseases quality (QoL) by enhan-cing muscle, or A-sensitive functions, ability to influence the course of underlining disease 35. This type of A therapy was mentioned in the literature mostly from the last decades of the XX century for several medical indications, including anemia as a result of non-hormonal chronic disorders published in the period 1950-2010 and they or except for burn injuries. Both Woerdeman59 and Handelsman35 studies with the exact points in order to confirm the long term safety and efficacy of AAS in other non-hormonal clinical conditions. An additional reason for current status of A as adjuvant, supportive or adjunctive second-line therapy effective medicines in these indications (erythropoietins for anemia in renal failure, biphos - phonates for osteoporosis, etc.). After the previously stated, can be concluded that modern, evidence-based medicine clearly positions T and its esters as the first- line therapy in LART in men, but when it comes to the pharmacological application of SA with dominant anabolic activity, the only reasonable indication is have to be proven. Anabolic steroids - medical indications as a goal According to Thieme D, et German scientists during the Second World War, shortly after the discovery of T itself. They are believed to have been tested on people, especially prisoners, but those results have never been publis- hed. Some personal war experiences of the surviving German soldiers speak of how they were given AS in order to increase the strength and aggressiveness. Adolf Hitler strengthen his aggressive personality, that was confirmed by notes of his doctor 1. Thus, the first use of AS in healthy people and for non-medical purposes was Figure and pharmacology to the status of lifestyle drugs - are we going in the right direction?105 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):101-108in German soldiers during the Second World War in order to increase their strength, endurance and aggressiveness. The use of AS in athletes was noted for the first time at the weight - lifting championships in Vienna in 1954 by Russian competitors2. Two years later CIBA Laboratories in Basel synthesized metandienone (Dia - nabol\u00ae) for the decades A abuse quickly spread into competition bodybuilding, track and field events and other sports where performance is dependent on muscle strength or speed of recovery during training60. However, at the beginning of 1980s, the changed globally and AS gradually shifted from to the general population 4. According to Kanayama G, et al .4, a typical \"user\" of AS nowadays is young to middle-aged man whose motivation for their use is primarily personal appearance and muscle mass. It is clear that the use of those substances in this context is not caused by any existing medical diagnosis. Although 23 different definitions of LD can be found in the litera - ture 61, the most operational one is that \"LD are drugs that could modify or change non-medical or non-health-related goal or conditions at the margins of \"found their place\" among substances of the modern times which alter not only the personal appearance, but also the physical and mental capabilities. Although all of these substances have the status licensed but wrinkles personal dissatisfaction with the amount and tonus of muscle mass in own body are not yet, that doesn't mean that they will not be soon. Or, maybe they actually exist, but we still don't know their name(s). Designer - did things get out of control? Designer steroids (DS) are AAS which to The first DS, tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) was discovered in 2003 in the Olympic Analytical Laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles66 (Figure 5). The disappointing thing is that, unlike the previously described AS, the discovery and development of DS have never been linked (in theory or practice) with any medical indication, which could justify their design and synthesis to a certain extent, at least from the ethical point of view. Cheating athletes have a double motivation to use DS: to achieve performance enhancement and to escape from testing positive in anti-doping tests. Both can be considered as deception in sport and human sense. The fact that the first and probably many other DS were synthesized in laboratories belonging to universities could be conside - red as the deception of science. In their discovery and development are working persons (scientists) for which the ethics and the truth should be the basic principles of their professional dealing. An increasing number of DS on the market which are mainly sold as dietary supplements 67 should for end-users. HG, et al. (2004), AAS users rated physicians as no more reliable source of information about those substances than their friends, Internet sites, or the persons who sold them the steroids 68. On the other side, most general practitioners had some contact with AAS users in their practice, but only 40% of them reported that they would be willing to well as the need for additional effective actions at different fields. How anabolic steroids act on healthy human organism - do we know possible consequences? For years, AS have been the most commonly detected doping substances in athletes70. In 2015, according to report, AS participated exactly 50% in all positive findings on doping71. In combi - nation high protein intake, AS undoubtedly increase muscle mass and body weight, there is little evidence that they increase muscle strength more than it would have been possible the training itself, or that their use would improve sports results in general 5. Given the disturbing fact that in the last decades AS have been increasingly used to improve the physical appearance of young people are not primarily athletes 4 aesthetic, psychological, sociological and non-sporting reasons, then we can state regrettably that, in this sense, these substances are likely to satisfy the needs of their users, at least for a limited period. On the other hand, since they are applied for a long time in supra-physiological doses, which are usually up to 50-100 times higher compared to endogenously produced T in an adult healthy male 72, their application is associated with long-term and serious adverse effects, of which cardiovascular, neuroendocrine are dominant6,7. The entity of side effects depends on the sex, the dose, duration of treatment, whether AS are taken training under HDL, of thrombosis and cardiac arr - Figura 5. Structural formula of and AS users in period 1990-20128, which proba - bly could be attributed to an imbalance of autonomous nervous system activity 77. Some authors suggest that in the cases of SCD in athletes the use of AS should be ex cluded74. The endocrinological effects of AS depend on the age and sex of the person using them14. In adult males, anabolic effects may be ac - companied by salt and water retention. The skin becomes thick often darker, influences adversely affect the mood, that forces a to take these substances repeatedly. BPH and prostate cancer in AS a sense of well-being, increase competitive spirit and aggressiveness, in some cases even to the level of psychosis 14. Violence, aggression and impulsivity are explained by of decrease in the functional correlation of key responsible for often applied \"cycle\" of AS5. A numerous cases of suicide in users with specificities substances in order to increase muscle mass, reduce fat tissue Even greater problem is that AS users are more likely - are the results of Arvary users began using it during the use of AS, that as many as 81% of respondents bought opiate for the first time from the same dealer who sold them AS, and 67% of the respondents took opiates in order to fight with AS abstinence syndrome. Ten years ago, Graham et al. accused the medical profession who didn't accept the fact that use dependency is a psychiatric condition causative the end of this chapter, the question arises is there the need to use other medicines in order to cure the \"lifestyle improvement\" caused by AS? Conclusions The hormonal effects of A are generally known in the professional, but also in general population, through various ways and levels of formal and informal education and experience. Scientists' attention is now CNS, that opens the new the treatment of certain diseases. In clinical terms, T and its T-containing medicines, of effective evidence, are still not licensed for women. When it comes to the type and selection of T pharmaceutical formulations, it can be concluded that there is a fairly wide selection of effective and safe preparations, both traditional modern, compliance and minimal negative impact on their QoL. When SA are concerned, it can be concluded that in the pharma - cokinetic sense their discovery and development fulfilled the expec - tations, but in clinical terms it is still not the case. Although there are undoubtedly promising results, scientific and high-quality clinical studies in order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of SA in most non-hormonal clinical they are proposing. However, thanks to their properties, SA have long been present in the population of healthy people without medical diagnosis. First of all they were soldiers, and then athletes. In the past decades, tight muscle and physical appearance imposed as which SA \"have dropped\" into the population of \"ordinary\"people around the world and give them the status of LD in reference literature. It went so far that nowadays DS are synthesized and used as dietary supplements without any medical reason, in order to deceive in achie - ving sports results and to circumvent institutional control, that is disappointing from many aspects. Existing research shows that both healthcare professionals and AS users don't know enough about them. Users don't have too much trust in doctors, and doctors admit that they don't know enough about these substances. Although they have of LD, numerous side effects, including deaths, warn and point to the need for development of additional comprehensive measures and clear strategies at different levels in order to prevent risks of AS abuse. of authors do not declare Drez D, eds.

Ha habido algunos casos de fraude, en los que hombres han competido en la categor\u00eda femenina, y otros, en los que algunas competidoras femeninas han suscitado sospechas sobre su sexo. El \u00faltimo caso conocido es el de la atleta sudafricana Caster Semenya, ganadora de la final de los 800 m en el Campeonato del Mundo de atletismo de Berl\u00edn de 2009 con 2:45 segundos menos que la segunda clasificada, a la que super\u00f3 en 16 m en la recta final.Tras multitud de estudios, se comprob\u00f3 que la atleta presentaba una condici\u00f3n m\u00e9dica denominada diferencia del desarrollo sexual (DSD), con producci\u00f3n de elevados niveles de testosterona.Las cifras elevadas de testosterona, con sensibilidad a esta hormona en mujeres, pueden suponer una enorme ventaja en el rendimiento deportivo, que se ha cuantificado en un rango sobre el 9%.La Federaci\u00f3n Internacional de Atletismo (IAAF) ha promulgado una normativa que obliga a las atletas femeninas con altos niveles de testosterona y sensibilidad a la misma, que quieren participar en pruebas de 400 m a la milla, a disminuir las cifras de testosterona mediante la utilizaci\u00f3n de estr\u00f3genos.Este trabajo analiza los sistemas de clasificaci\u00f3n deportiva, los efectos fisiol\u00f3gicos de la testosterona, las bases de la diferen - ciaci\u00f3n sexual, y presenta los argumentos m\u00e9dicos y deontol\u00f3gicos para rebatir la obligaci\u00f3n de tratamiento hormonal de mujeres para poder competir en especialidades deportivas.Palabras clave: Clasificaci\u00f3n deportiva.

The last known case is the South African athlete Caster Semenya, who won the final of the 800 m in the World Championships in Berlin in 2009 with 2.45 seconds less than the second classified, with a distance of 16 m in the final straight.After a multitude of studies, it was verified that the athlete presented a medical condition called difference of the sexual development (DSD), with a production of high levels of testosterone.High testosterone levels, with sensitivity women, may represent a huge advantage in sports performance, which has been quantified by a range over 9%.The International athletes with high levels of testosterone and sensitive to it, who want to participate in 400m to a mile tests, to decrease by of testosterone, the basis of sexual differentiation, and presents the medical and deontological arguments to refute the obligation of hormonal treatment of women to be able to compete in sports.Key words: Sports classification.

Reglamento de clasificaci\u00f3n deportiva para atletas con diferencias en el desarrollo sexual (DSD) Correspondence: Pedro Manonelles Deporte On 23 April, 2018, the International Association of Athletics Fe - derations published DEVELOPMENT)1 that was scheduled to come into force on 1 November, 2018, but this was suspended on the basis of the appeal made by the female athlete, Caster Semenya, before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and conditional upon its final ruling. These regulations were drawn up as a consequence of the debate which arose due to the sports results of women athletes who had achieved very significant advantages over their opponents. All this was particularly significant in the case of the South African athlete mentioned above. This female athlete won the women's 800 m trial in the 2009 World Championship in Berlin with a time of 1:55.45 min, while the athlete coming in second took 1: 57.90: a difference of 2.45 seconds i.e. a distance of more than 16 meters (Figure 1). In this 800 m trial Semenya won the final of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 and was World Champion in Berlin in 2009 and in London in 2017. Her best time was 1:54.25 and she also won international competitions between 400 m and 1500 m. However, it should be borne in mind that she was also defeated on the track in the 800 m women's race in the London Olympics in 2012 and the 2011 Daegu World Championship, both times by an athlete who was subsequently stripped of both gold medals for having used doping and who was suspended for that reason for 4 years. Both medals were then also awarded to Caster Semenya. Semenya has been giving rise to speculations in the me - dia, like she had used doping substances, or that she was in fact a man. As a result of all this, Semenya has undergone a number of whose results seem unfortunately to have been leaked to the media. In the case of other studies, numerous speculations have been reported. the athlete suffers from androgenism and that she has a blood testosterone level higher than the reference values for women characteristics. Before moving forward, it must be considered that other elite athle - tes have also been subjected to intense media exposure for the same reasons: their physical appearance and exceptional sports performance. The perception that several of them are competing or have competed at the highest level in the 800 m trial, like the holder herself of the world record for that distance (1: 53.28 since 1983) seems very strange. Back in 2010, Semenya underwent a thorough examination by a group of specialists who determined that she should compete as a wo - man and without any limitation. However, her exceptional performance and its media impact led the IAAF to look for a method to avoid such major differences between competitors, to of producing the regulations of 2018, already cited 1. As a result of all the above, this report aims to analyse the regulations that the IAAF intends to impose in order to reduce the differences in performance in women's athletics, from the points of view of Sports Ethics and especially of Medicine. Physiological aspects It is undeniably clear that have significant in mus - cle size, strength and power, compared with women. Table 1, produced by the authors, shows the percentage differences between men and women, in some of the world records in athletics. To this end, only trials where women and men competed under equal conditions (ruling out obstacle races, which have height, and throwing with different weights) have been considered. In order to compare these differences in jumps and races, the records of female athletes have been expressed by transforming the record time into the race speed (metres per second -1). Generally, this difference is quantified as a 10-12% of the women's 800m final of the World Athletics Championships, Berlin 2009. Table 1. Analysis of the percentage differences between men and women for some world records in athletics.

In addition, it can be seen how, in the case of jumps, where rapid use of muscle strength is of major importance, the differences are 17.9%). Although this cannot be compared, one could venture that it is very possible that in throwing that difference would be even Sport-based classification, gender, in all sports and is something totally accepted today. The almost insurmountable differences in performance between women and men is the clear reason for this separation. To maintain this the pitfalls in gender clas - sification, in 1950 the IAAF set down a regulation including physical medical examinations, regulations that, in the long run, were extended to other sports. Back in 1950, an athlete was prevented from continuing her sports career due to refusing to undergo one of these medical exa-minations. The standards developed further and in in a saliva sample as an initial test. If in this test some Y chromosome was detected, medical examinations and were happily repealed in all sports. In the early 1990s the use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique was advocated for the extension and examination of DNA strands, as a method which was more objective and scientific. Finally, in 2011 the IAAF set down two different regulations, one for people with sex reassignment 3, and another for female athletes with hyperandrogenism4. 2015, a female Indian brought an appeal to the CAS regarding her suspension due to a diagnosis of hyperandrogenism, after a process the CAS finally accepted that there was not enough evidence of the advantage that a higher level of testosterone could produce in female athletes 5. Thus, the IAAF regulation on hyperandrogenism was repealed. As can be seen, this is a recurrent issue, which appears to be har - ming a number of women athletes, until institutions are persuaded that the matter should be left off the agenda. Now, in 2018 and 2019, we are once again in the worst possible position as regards the rights of certain athletes. Sexual differentiation Biological gender is of chromosomal, gonadal, hormonal and phenotypic sex, each of which is fixed in an individual. Generally, all these classifications of gender are aligned in a congenital conditions that cause misalig - nment and atypical the chromosomal, gonadal and / or anatomical genders. As a medical of these conditions, terms such as \"disorders or anomalies was introduced however all of these have been widely contested in the scientific literature6-10. Currently they phenotypes and XY-man7,11. In the administra - tive field, there are a number of national systems that recognize legal genders which are with powers in the field of the protection of human rights attempt to avoid harmful practices and discrimination against people with these conditions. In 2015, the United Nations High Commissioner launched a campaign for the free equality of rights of people classified as \"intersex\" 12. Equally, in 2015 the Council of Europe made a statement asking member states for consider the new and better classification individuals In 2016, numerous Committees and U.N. subcommittees (Against Torture, of the Rights of the Child, of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities), together with the Council of Europe and the Human Rights Commissions of Africa and the Americas, launched a document calling for an end to the violent and harmful medical practices on \"intersex\" children and adults14. We should not forget that disclosing information about the medical history of any patient can lead to very serious consequences15. Further - more, in these sensitive cases public knowledge of this protected data will have irreparable consequences for the normal physical development of young people and the psychosocial sphere of all those affected16,17, as established by the World Health Organization18. Regarding the aspect of foetal sexual differentiation, it gonadal and genital develop - ment (6 weeks post-fertilization), which is common to both sexes, it is in the period of differentiation when these conditions may occur and have been given the controversial classifications previously identified. comprise (genital) criteria considered \"Differences in Sexual Development (DSD)\" . Their classification can be seen in Table 2 19. As regards the involvement of testosterone, it should be remembe - red that the majority have ((7.7-29.4 nmol.L-1). It is accepted that, in the al.112 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):109-116People with DSD may have very high levels of natural testosterone that may be similar to, or higher than, normal male values20. There is a broad medical and scientific consensus that, if these people are sensitive to androgens, i.e. if they have normo-functioning androgen receptors, and record high muscle mass, strength and haemoglobin level may much - fore, significantly improve their sports potential 21-35. It that an increase of blood testosterone rate in women between 0.9 and 7.3 nmol.L -1 produces an increase in muscle mass of 4% in 12-26%. The increase in testosterone haemoglobin over or actionChanges in androgen synthesis to environmental modulators anomalies (e.g. MODY 5) Vaginal Sport classification regulations for athletes with differences in sexual development (DSD)113 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):109-116All this indicates that, for the most part, the competitive advantages of men are attributable to the action of male sex hormones, in such a way that the increase in testosterone in women from the range of rate of haemoglobin. The ergogenic power of testosterone and that of all its derivatives and other substances with similar chemical structure or biological effects, is manifested by its inclusion Agency's (WADA) List of Prohibited Substances and Methods 36. These substances are prohibited at all times (in and out of competition) and in all sports, as Non-Specific Substances in Category S1: Anabolic Agents. These are included in that list since it has existed, and their use is considered to be a case of utmost seriousness. However, from the legal point of view, the CAS ruling of 2015 should be recalled 5, stating that there is not enough evidence of the advantage that a higher rate of testosterone may give to female athletes. For its part, the IAAF has compiled observational data on the effects of artificial levels on suppression case of three female athletes with DSD from between 21 and 25 nmol.L -1 down to a rate below 2 nmol.L-1 led to a decrease in their performance on average of 5.7%, as can be observed in Figure 221,37. This study - continue the female category. Application the IAAF regulations1 Sphere The IAAF data would indicate that the advantages of some athletes with DSD have had a significant effect on mid-distance track events, so it is inferred from this that the rule only applies to events from 400 m to a mile (which the regulations term \"Restricted Events\"). In international competition and outdoor track events, these events are: 400 m., 400 m hurdles, 800 m, 1500 m and one mile, alone or as part of a relay race or a combined trial. The special eligibility requirements described Competition. The describe as \"Relevant Athlete\" those who meet the following three criteria: Women with one of the following DSDs: - D eficiency of 5-reductase type (PAIS). effect. Conditions for eligibility Being recognized by law as a woman or as intersexual (or equi - valent). Reducing the rate of (in for as long as wished to maintain eligibility compete in the female classifica tion in Restricted Events in international competition (or setting a world record in a Restricted Event in a competition that is not an international contest). Taking part without high levels of testosterone The allow women want above guidelines participate in the following the female classification: - I n any competition that is not an international competition. - I n international competitions: in any discipline other than track events of between 400 m and one mile. In the men's classification: In any competition at any level, in any discipline, without restriction. In any 'intersex' classification (or similar) that the organizer of the event can offer in any competition at any level, in any discipline, without restriction. Reasons given by the IAAF for implementing this rule The arguments expressed by the IAAF in the text1, are as follows: To guarantee fair and - that playing field and to guarantee that success Figure 2.

To benefit a broad class of female athletes. To encourage athletes to achieve the great commitment and sa - crifice required to excel in sport, and thus inspire new generations to take up sport and to aspire to the same excellence. It does not wish to risk discouraging those significant advantages in size, strength and that men generally possess over women from puberty, largely due to much higher levels of circulating testosterone in males, and the impact these advantages may have on sport performance, it is generally accepted that competition between male and female athletes would fair would discouraging women from participating in sport. Therefore, in addition to the separate competition categories based arguments against the IAAF regulations We must begin with the very concept of competitive sport as a human activity based on Competition inequality that is what gives rise to the victory of some over others. Setting down rules that try to eliminate or reduce this inequality would transform athletic competition into something else. Sports performance is an extremely complex phenotypic trait that in turn is influenced, although not determined, by many other traits, such as of capacity, strength skills 38. Although the extrinsic determinants of human athletic performance, such as training, nutrition, living conditions, etc., have an undoubted and significant impact on sports performance, the importance of determinants must not be trivialized, among these the genetic ones. It is clear that it is impossible to establish a single formula for anyone to become a sports champion and that quantifying the contribution of each of these determinants continues to be a challenge to research in sports science 39-42. Howe ver, certain people who have not undergone is already able to demonstrate extraordinarily high levels of physical performance. Some people also show a better response to training and improve their performance much more than others. when following the same working programme40,41. The fact that genetics is a very significant intrinsic factor in athletic performance is shown by the analysis of athlete rankings (year 2018 on 17 December) where it can be seen that, in the 1500 m, 14 of the 15 best all-time records were set by athletes born on the African continent, and that the first 7 athletes in this trial in 2018 were born in Ethiopia, while only one thrower with one of the top 60 world times (15 in each of the weight-lifting, discus, hammer and javelin trials) was born in Africa, and only 4 in total (7%) had a phenotype for that continent.The IAAF intends to delimit a group of Restricted Events (400 m to one mile) to apply this regulation, without stating any objective reason why this is done in these trials and not in other events. It should be borne in mind that, as has already been explained, there is no evidence that high testosterone levels in women may be more advantageous in these trials than in others, and it has already been seen that in the jump disciplines this advantage may be greater. In this way the IAAF would be legislating in violation of the principle of generality by derogating a la artificial reduction of the advantage that nature has granted to certain women in the form of higher blood testosterone levels, could be somewhat random, since there is no evidence of a direct relationship between the reduction in the rate of testosterone in athletes, hyperandrogenism and the impact on sports performance. Consequently, with the same decrease in blood testosterone, even taking this at the same level, this could affect the running speed to a different extent in one female athlete from another. And what testosterone levels basis has become much better known over the last decades44-45. Today, numerous studies are advancing in the description of a genetic load similar to the cases of female hyperandrogenism men who could obtain good results in those Restricted events or any other trial have applied to them regulations similar to those that the IAAF wants to apply to women? We cannot conclude without taking into account the efforts that the governments of the world and the sports movement have been making to eradicate the scourge of doping. the World this effort in its programs seek to what This intrinsic value is often referred to as \"the spirit of sport. \" it is the essence of Olympism, the pursuit of human excellence through the dedicated perfection of each person's natural talents. It is how we play true. The spirit of sport is the celebration of the human spirit, body and mind, and is reflected in values we find in and through sport, ... \" As can be seen, natural talent is the excellence that is sought to be preserved, so how can this fight be justified, if when these natural talents appear, the attempt is to eliminate them in an artificial way? That way we cannot defend fair play 51. Medical ethics arguments against the If sports ethics these regulations seem overwhel- are very clear and concise seem much more important - and any medical professional will undoubtedly understand these. The rules of Medicine prohibit the use of medication that is destined to indications for any other outside in sexual development (DSD)115 Arch Med Deporte 2019;36(2):109-116trary to medical practice and is therefore an offence on the part of the prescribing physician52. These regulations, which aim to reduce performance in people who have innate qualities of genetic origin and means, would undoubtedly apply in for this purpose could clearly be an offence. But above all, it should be noted that in the mind of every doctor, in their relationship with their patients, the side effects, contraindi risks that prescribed medication could have should take pride of place. It should not be forgotten that the drugs that affect sphere are beyond their medical indications 53. Finally, it is necessary to add the problem that arises in cases like these with respect to the protection of data and even individuals' rights. We are seeing women who, as a result of wanting to exercise their right to practice themselves involved in maximum possible circulation results, examinations and me - dical diagnoses, to then be exhibited in the media at the same level as cheating athletes who use doping to excel in sports. Conclusion Faced with these regulations that clearly fly in the face of unques - tionable evidence from the point of view of sportsmanship, against the oath of medical practice, and even against the rights of individuals, we can only demand their immediate repeal.
