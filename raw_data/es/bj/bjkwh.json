The objective of the present study was to theoretically evaluate the 28 designed under the recommended was as a diet. Some exchanged with foods enriched in bre, calcium, Results: basal bre and calcium with mean intake of 28 g and 1241 mg, respectively. The current intake of salt, if iodized, or bread elaborated with this salt, allowed reaching the daily intake of iodine every day, with mean supply mg/d and 278 mg/d, respectively. The supply of vitamin in increased enriched margarine, butter and biscuits and soya drink instead of milk. Conclusions: In order to improve the accomplishment of the vitamin strategies and health. This fact has given rise to the development of new food with new formula- tions designed only more recently. Functional foods can be considered to be those whole, fortied, enriched or enhanced foods that provide health benets provision of essential nutrients cacious levels as of on a regular basis(1). Functional foods the most intensively investigated and widely promoted areas in the food and nutrition sciences nowadays. There is scientic evidence essential performance well as disease prevention(2). There is a great offer of functional foods and especially of enriched foods on the market. However, there are not many studies showing the real impact of these foods in the diet and the extent to which they really assure an compounds that considered thyroid iodized salt has been established by WHO in trying to reduce it(5). The relationship between calcium and bone metabolism is as the importance of an adequate intake (AI) of calcium as a key factor in decreasing the risk of osteoporosis(6). Vitamin D is directly to interesting being studies to have to the essential linolenic fatty acid have been studied in the last several years. The benecial effects of a low n-6:n-3 ratio in relation to the prevention and development of CVD have been widely investigated(11). The European Union has and minerals and recently n-3 fatty acids in to make nutritional claims on commercial foods(12,13). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the nutritional relevance of incorporating some foods enri- ched in different in a basal diet. A total or partial substitution of some conventional foods by their enriched counterparts assayed. Materials and methods The basal diet was based on a 28 d dietary plan, which was designed by expert dietitians and nutritionists by carbohydrates, 28 ?4 % was supplied by fat, and protein contributed 18 ?7 % of D E and n-3 were selected from the market. Table 1 shows the nutritional composition of these foods (obtained from the nutritional labels) and that of the and the of the foods exchanged in the different proposed diets.With regard to bre enrichment, several special diets with different enriched (bread, cereals changed. For calcium and vitamins A, D and E, only one alternative diet was proposed in each case, including foods found on the market that increased each com- pound (diets 4, 8, of salt is not obligatory, but iodine is allowed to be added at 60 mg/kg salt(15). The information given by WHO regarding the recommended total daily salt intake (5 g), the estimated total daily mean salt intake (11 g) and the percentage of table salt referred to the total mean salt intake (13 %) was into account was elaborated by substituting 0 ?65 g (13 % of 5 g) of table salt with iodized salt and diet 6, by substituting 1 ?5 g (13 % of 11 g) of the total salt with iodized salt. Finally, diet 7 was developed by substituting the bread included in the basal diet (180 g/d ) with bread made with iodized two diets were proposed to the substituted conventional margarine, butter enriched alternatives. More- over, these diets included the substitution of milk with n-3-enriched milk (diet or with soya drink dietitians derived the energy and nutrient intake of the d dietary plan from Spanish food composition tables, using a computer program (Calidiet, University of Navarra, of n-3 and food tables(16). was made before and after the substitution of diets by the enriched foods.

Thus, it is interesting to evaluate the diets in global context to suitability in relation to the intake obtained from food composition tables and from labels of the foods included in the study. However, the different bioavailability of nutrients was not taken into Table the composition of the enriched foods used for the substitutions. It can be observed that, in general, except for the component in which the modied food is enriched, the composition of these products can be considered equivalent to that of conventional foods. shows the mean amounts nutrients for the basal and modied diets during the 28 d of the the descriptive parameters with regard to the percentages of the RI or AI for each nutrient covered by the different diets. With regard to intake, a mean value of g/d was observed for basal diet, higher than 25 g, which was taken as the AI (Table 3). On a daily basis, 76 % of thedays achieved the AI (Table 4). The day with the mini- mum supply reached 75 ?1 % of the AI. In the Dorica II Study, mean bre consumption was 21 g/d in men and 18 g/d in women(17). Another study carried out on thirty-eight postmenopausal women aged between 46 and 60 years showed population consumed 21 ?3 g bre/d(18). The obtained al.(20)estimated that the of bre in France is 19 ?1 g/d in men and 15?9 g/d in women, similar to the intake in Spain. The Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) cohort study revealed intakes of bre in Spanish university graduates to be around 26 ?7 g/d, an amount similar to that observed in the present study. In this cohort, bre from cereals was statistically signicantly associated with a reduction in the risk of hypertension, with wholegrain bread being the main source of this type of bre(21). When foods enriched in bre (cereals, dairy products and a combination of both) were included instead of their respective conventional products, sig- bre were detected every day, with amounts over the RI. In some cases, it was even possible to observe that the intake could be 51 ?2-78?8 g/d, which means 204-315 % of the RI. It has to be noted that there are studies pointing out that an excessive intake of bre can adverse effects. The consumption of high amounts of dietary bre may cause a decrease in theTable 2 Thirteen types of diet depending on the foods that have been chosen by dairy products enriched in bre Ca (RI ( .20 years) 0 Basal diet 4 Dairy Dairy Basal Conventional bread Bread elaborated with iodized salt Vitamin A (RI .20 years: men women etc.(23). over, obstruction and formation of phytobezoars ingestion of water intake is limited.

These data agree with data reported by WHO(27), in which calcium intake by adults in Spain is 1267 mg/d, and with data from the recommendations, between 650 mg/d and 750 and was lower in women(29). However, calcium consumption of elderly people was 792 mg/d for women and 813 mg/d for men(30). In a study carried out with it observed that calcium intake of this population was 805 mg/d for men and 938 mg/d for women. It was also observed that 66 % of individuals (65 % of men and 68 % of women) consumed fortied foods(31). Calcium intake in France was 974 men and 837 mg/d in women(20). The results show that with the designed basal diets there is no need to include calcium-fortied foods to cover current recommendations. The higher than the RI. It has that a high intake of calcium has deleterious effects health, Zinc calcium found in present study corresponded to that in diet 4, reaching a maximum of 1766 mg/d, still far from the UL (upper limits) for this mineral (2500 mg/d). In contrast to the contribution of calcium are for women and 140 mg/d for men. Although in the basal diet a mean intake value of 128 mg/d for the 28 d was observed, it has to be noted that the median was 107 mg/d. Only in 25 % of days for men and in 46 % for women did the basal diet cover the daily recommended values. The maximum iodine level (366?2mg/d) was due to the presence of red mullet (Mullus sp.) in the menu. contributed other days of the dietary plan. Effectively, the presence of sh in The use of iodized table salt instead of common salt (diet 6) allowed reaching the RI of iodine every day, for both men and women. According to WHO, the current salt intake nowadays in Spain is around 11 g/d. If iodized table salt was provided 5) with the recommendations covered for women every day and in 71 % of the days for men (mean value 5166mg/d). Vitti et al.(34)showed that the strategy of is very cheap, benecial impact When the developed diet substituted the use of daily bread (180 g/d) made with iodized salt (diet 7) instead of common salt, the results were even more favourable, with a mean intake of iodine of around 278mg/d, which meant 199 % and 253 % of the RI for men and women, respectively. This fact let us to conclude that the development of new products made with iodized salt could be a very easy and efcient technological to the basal diets reached the RI for vitamins A (men and women) and D. In the case of vitamin A, the RI for men was higher than for women, and the median for the percentage of RI was 97 ?8 %, indicating that on a signicant number of days the intake of vitamin A for men did not reach 100 % of the RI (the 25th percentile was 69?4 % of RI; Table 4). vitamin showed a high dispersion ( SD), with a median of around half of the RI (58?1 %). The worst situation was found for vitamin E, which showed a mean and a median supply of 8 mg/d, with 12 mg/d being its RI. This amount was covered only in 4 % of the days. In fact, the value found for the 75th percentile was only 9 ?3 mg/d. These ndings were likely due to the strict control of the fat content in the designed diets. In a study developed in Spain, it was found that the consumption of vitamin A is 800 ?63mg/d(35), and in a previous one the consumption was found to be 686 mg/d for men and 665 mg/d for women(36). Moreover, vitamin A deciency may be a of anaemia, although further study is needed to characterize both the pathogenesis and public health importance of this pathology(37). In Spain, the eVe Study(36)provided data conrming the possible deciency of vitamins D and E with mean intakes for men and women under the RI (vitamin D, men 2?42mg/d and women 1 ?96mg/d; vitamin E, men 9 ?1 mg/d, women 8 ?3 mg/d). Furthermore, a study adults, concluding that the on nutrient adequacy dairy were covered, achieving a median percentile already covered the RI for both men and women. The UL for this vitamin was established at 3000 mg/d. This value was reached only once the excessive were the was also higher than the RI, with a mean of 10 mg/d, which was twice the RI but far from the UL (50 mg). The enriched diets showed a median value basal diet. How- ever, probably the most relevant change was for the enriched foods allowed reaching a RI for this vitamin. Finally, we analysed the condition of n-3 fatty acids. As observed for vitamin mean contribution of did RI. Specically, the basal diet covered the daily requirements only on 25 % of the days (Table 4). According to Sanchez- Villegas et al .(39)then-3 Spanish population is 0 ?99 g/d, a value that does not reach the RI these fatty acids. The inclusion 3) and the number of days reaching the RI from 25 % to 43 % (Table 4). However, only the substitution of milk by and biscuits (diet 12) was able to reach the RI on most of the days (93 %; Table 4), obtaining a mean intake of acids achieved with diets 11 and 12, a decrease in the n-6:n-3 ratio (from 10 ?4 in the basal diet to 7 ?6 in the diets) is 15(40), the recommended values being about 4-5(40,41). The use of soya drink instead of milk as a source of n-3 fatty acids (diet 12) did not affect the bre, or quantitatively similar diet to in the basal diet, showed a different bioavailability depending on acids. However, no problems were found with regard to bre and calcium. The sub- stitution of conventional foods by enriched 2010 CARNISENUSA (Ministerio e Innovacio \u00b4n).

E-mail Cold-pressed avocado oil is relatively in culinary circles, and its production volume is relatively small compared with other oi ls, with approximately 2000 tonnes /year. New Zealand, Mexico, Chile, United States and South Africa are among the main avocado oil producers. Its significant production, commercialization and marketing are only occurring in the twenty-first century and li mited published information still exists on this product (Woolf et al., 2008). Avocado oil has the advantage, as it occurs with olive oil, which can be obtained from the fruit by means of a cold extraction method, which is an easy, low cost technology that allows maintaining in the oil signi ficant amounts of the bioactive phytochemicals present in the It shoul d be mentioned that, when modify the physical ( Ortiz-Moreno , Guzman, 2003). As it has been also pointed out for other type s of oils, avocado oil could be used as an ingredient in foods because of its concentration of Navia, Faci & Aparicio , 2003). In vitro and in vivo studies i ndicate that avocado fruit can be considered as part of a cancer prevention diet because o f t h e i r h i g h c o n t e n t o f phytochemicals ( Ding, Chin, Kinghorn, D\u0092'Ambrosio & th bioactive Go , 2005). Compared to other fruits, a vocado contains a high amount of sterols which are extracted together with some other unsaponifiable components with the oil. Woolf et al. (2008) 2 pointed out that the co ncentration of sterols in avoca do oil is around 3.3 mg/g oil with up to 4.5 in some cases (being the main compound -sitosterol) being significantly higher than that in triter pene compounds, similar in structure to cholesterol, that are found in plants. They can be divided into three oils heated to temperatures Regarding -dimethylsterols, although some healthy propertie s have been described for some of them , they have in salads , but are used to cook, using different culinary processes. In these cases, oils are heated to temperatures of the culinary process (temperature and time), the type of oil used and the type of fried rich in unsaturated fatty to oxidati saturated fatty acids (Choe & Min, established able than other vege tal hi gh amount of MUFA (Koski et al., 2002) compounds (Teissedre & Waterhouse , 2000). oil has not been considered as an important source of oil, few studies have been developed about its properties for culinary application. The objective of this work was to st udy the stability of the saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions of avocado oil under a drastic heating treatment and to compare it to that of olive oil. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Materials The oils used in this study were Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Koipe, Sos Corporaci\u00f3n Alimentaria, S.A., Madrid, Spain) and Avocado Oil (Denova Products cc, Louis Trichardt, South Africa), which is derived fr om the first pressing of the mature fruit using the cold-pressed -tocopherol acetate (Barcelona, Spain). nd methanol from Scharlab (Barcelona, Spain). 4 2.2. Heating study For the heating study, sets of 5 g of both oils test tubes were placed in the thermo block (Temblock, Selecta \u0093, Spain) previously stabilized at 180 \u00baC. Test tu bes were left open and remove d from the thermo block at different heating times up to 9 hours. Then, the samples were cooled in an ice bath for 20 minutes. Finally, the tubes were covered and stored in the freezer (-20 \u00baC) until analysis. 2.3. Oil analysis 2.3.1. Fatty acid profile Fatty acids were determined in the oils by gas chromatography FI data adquisition (TotalChrom, version 6.2.1) was used. It was capillary column SPTM-2560 (100 m\u00d70.25 mm\u00d70.2 m). The temperature of both the injec tion port was 250 \u00baC and detector was 260 \u00b0C, the oven temperature was programmed to increase from 170 to 200 \u00b0C at a rate of 10.0 \u00b0C/min and then at rate of 4.0 \u00baC/m in to 220 \u00baC. The carrier gas was hydrogen, 30.0 psi. The sample size was 0.5 l and the split ratio was 120. The quantification of individual fatty acids used heptadecanoic ac id methyl ester as internal standard. The identification of the fatty acids was done by comparison of their retention times with 5 those of pure fatty acid methyl esters. The sampling times for this parameter were 0, 3 and 9 hours. 2.3.2. Determination of Sterols Three grams (\u00b1 0.02 g) of oil sample and 1mL of internal standard (5 -Cholestane: Ethanol (20 mL) a nd KOH (50%) (5 mL) were added to the sample and subjected to a warm agitation fo r 1h (<50 \u00baC). 13 mL of distillated water were added and six extractions with 20-25 mL of hexane were done, collecting the phase sample was further dried under nitrogen f l o w . T h i s u n s a p o n i f i a b l e f r a c t i o n w a s derivatized with 400 L of Tri-Sil in a hot water bath (60 \u00ba C for 45 minutes) to form the trimethyl nitrogen flow and the sample was diluted in 10 mL of hexane. The TMS of sterols were analyzed in an HP 6890 GC system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) coupled to a 5973 Mass Selective Detector (Hewlett-Packard). 1 L was injected into GC, equipped with a cap illary column (30 m x 250 m x 0.25 m nominal HP-5MS). The carrier gas was He (1 mL/min), and the chromatographic conditions \u00baC and subsequently programmed from 85 to 290 \u00baC at a rate of 50 \u00baC/min a nd at a rate of 0.5 \u00baC/min from 290 to 298 \u00baC. The injector and the detector temperatur es were set at 280 \u00baC and 300 \u00baC, respectively. Acquisition ma Electron Identification of the peaks was based on comparison of their mass spectra with the spectra of the Wiley library (HPCHEM, Wiley, 275, 6th ed.) and also with those obtained from the literature. In some cases, a 6 comparison of their retention time and MS fragments with the of a specifi c ion for each peak (Table and taking into account the relative proportion in whic h this ion is present in g oil PA s = sterol peak area on ion basis F = proportion in which the ion is present in the peak PA is = internal standard peak area mis = weight (mg) of the internal standard m = weight (g) of oil taken for analysis The sampling times for this parameter were 0, 3 and 9 hours. 2.3.3. TBARs value TBARS values were 2-thi obarbituric acid in N hydrochloric acid. The oil (0.5 g), disti llate water (0.5 mL), 20 \u00b5L of BHT (1%) and the TBARS reagent (2 mL) vortexed a centrifuge tube m ediately af ter combining, for 30 sec, placed in a boiling water bath for exactly 15 min and then cooled in an ice bath to room temperature. Cycl ohexanone (4 mL) and ammonium sulphate (1 mL, 4M) were added to the mixture and we re vortexed for 30 sec. The mixture was centrifuged at room temperature at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. A calibration curve with TEP (tetraethoxypropane) was done for quantificatio n purposes, using the same procedure as 7 with the sample. Results were expressed in mg of malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents/ kg product. The sampling times for this parameter were 0, 0.5, 2, 3, 6 and 9 hours. 2.3.4. Tocopherol analysis The determination of the toc opherol content in the oils wa s done by HPLC-UV analysis. 0.1 g of oil and 0.1 mL of internal standard ( -tocopherol acetate 10 mg/mL solved m (Syringe-driven F ilter recorded a Perkin Elme r UV-Vis Lambda 200 Series equipped with a photodiode array detector Series 200 PDA, using a Supercosil LC18 column (25 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 m particle size; Perkin Elmer Brownlee columns, Massachusetts, USA). A total of 1 L of the sample was injected into HPLC and . The UV acquisition was recorded at 292 nm for 12 min run. Identification of -Tocopherol was done using the retention time of the pure standard compound (RT = 4.5 min) (V itamin E 97 %) and its characteristic UV 7.5 min) (V itamin E acetate 98 %). The sampling times for this parameter were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours. 2.4. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using t student test for th e evaluation of the results obtained in two oils in the same time of heating pro cess. A one way Anova test and the Tukey b post hoc test were used to determine significan t differences among the different times of heating process for the same oil. Correla tion between TBARs vitamin E content 8 was evaluated by Pearson\u0092's correlation te st. SPSS version 15.0 was used (SPSS inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). Significance level of p \u00940.05 was used for all evaluations. 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Avocado oil vs. olive oil As in the case of olive oil, the beneficial h e a l t h p r o p e r t i e s o f avocado oil could be attributed to its composition, a high MUFA content amount s high (68.4 %), reachi ng oleic acid 54.4 % of total FA. These data are in agreement with those of Ortiz Moreno et al . (2003) who found oleic acid amounts in the range of 5 2 - 6 0 % d e p e n d i n g o n the oil extracting methods used. Wang, Hwang, Yoon & Choe ( 2 0 0 1 ) r e p o r t e d h i g h e r m e a n v a l u e s f o r Hass avocado oil from different countries ( 6 1 . 7 - 7 7 . 8 % ) . O t h e r M U F A p r e s e n t i n significant amount were palmitoleic ( 7 . 9 % ) a n d v a c c e n i c ( 5 . 9 % ) a c i d s . Plaza, Sanchez-Moreno, de Pascual-Teresa, de Ancos & Cano (2009) found 57 % of oleic acid of the total fatty acids and lower (6 %) and higher (9 %) amounts palmitoleic ount of oleic acid shown by olive oil, which, at the same time, showed lower amounts palmitoleic and of present in olive oil, being this acid quantitatively th e third fatty acid in both types of oils. Also 9 -linolenic was slightly, but significantly the amount detected in olive oil (0.33 %). Ortiz Moreno et al. (2003) found values for total trans fatty acids in avocado oil between depending on the method of extraction used. In that work the use of mi crowave resulted in the to 0.87 %. in the fatty ac ids profile gave rise t o s o m e s i g n i f i c a n t differences in the ratios with interest fr om the nutritional point of view. The ratio PUFA/SFA was higher in avo cado oil (14.05) than olive oil (8.41), to the high am ount of linoleic acid ( -6). Regarding these two last data, avocado oil did not show from the nutritional standpoint, an compared to oil. between the two oils were illustrated in figure 1 and table 2, where two TIC GC-MS chromatogram s are shown, one for each type of oil. As it can be observed, some coleutions were noticed, and the different ions used for the monitorization and quantification of the compounds by SIM mode (single ion monitoring) analysis are shown. The mo st abundant compound in both oils was sitosterol, as it will b e d i s c u s s e d b e l o w , t h a t c o r r e s ponded to peak G. The peak that followed sitosterol contained mainly 5-avenasterol, accompanied by sitostanol and by -amyrine at the tailing edge. Sim ilarly, a coleution is observed for peaks compressed within RR between 1.07 and 1.08, which were identified 7- sitostanol, cycloartenol , cycloeucalenol and 7- avenasterol, according to literature MS 10 data. Five of the quantified compounds in this work were not identified or found in the literature. These compounds accounted for a 4.4 and 11.5 % in olive oil and avocado oil, respectively. their characterization, as well as in their potential effects on health. As it was expected, the amount of sterols in the avocado oi l was much than is considered as a potential f ingredient mg/100 g & Drover, 2002). The most abundant sterols in avocado oil we re the 4-desmethyl-sterols, reaching the 80 % of the total fraction. Sitosterol was the most abundant sterol mg/100 Azadmard-Damirchi, & Dutta of sitosterol from 46.1 to 406 mg/100 g in different types of oils, including palm oil (with the lowest content) (with the highest content). Also other 4-desmethylsterol s are present in in significant amounts as campesterol g) g). other two fractions, 4-monomethyl and 4,4\u0092'-dimethylsterols, were 2 . 7 % a n d 5 . 5 % f r o m t h e t o t a l s t e r o l s with citrostadienol and cycloartenol , as the main compounds from each one. The analysis of the olive oil sterol prof ile was significantly different. It showed percentages of 48.4 %, 3.2 % 4-monomethyl and 4,4\u0092'- 11 dimethylsterols, respectively, these results similar to th ose found by D\u00b4Evoli et al. (2006) and by Azadmard-Damirchi, Nemati, Hesari, oil (Azadmard-Damirchi et al., 2010b). The analysis of vitamin E showed much hi gher amounts of vit E in o l i v e o i l t h a n i n avocado oil (35.5 and 24.5 mg vit E/100 g oil, Results obtained for Lozano, & the vit E cont ent in avocado oil depending on the degree of fruit maturation, finding that oil from mature fruits had lower amount of vit E than oil from immature fru avocado oil and th ey found oil, much lower amount than that obtained in this work. 3.2. Effects of heating treatment Oil behaviour during heating was evaluated by the evolution of TB ARs (Figure 1) and also through the analysis of the modifications suffered bot h by the saponifiable (fatty acids, Table and the unsaponifiable fractio ns, including the of Comparing the fatty acid profile at 0 and 3 h of heating it can be observed that SFA 12 increased in 0.46 g found during the first hours of heating (1, 2, 3 and 6 hours). TB ARs was slightly higher in avocado than in olive oil before heating, and during the fi rst 2 hours of treatment , it showed a similar increment in both oils (+0.35 and +0.49). After that, the magnitude in the increment was higher in olive respectively) reaching the maximum values at 6 h. It has to be remembered that unsaturated fatty acids are more prone to oxidation than SFA. There were no da ta available for fatty acids at 6 hours of heating but analyzing the evolution from 3 t o 9 h o u r s i t c a n b e o b s e r v e d t h a t SFA increased in 0.31 g in olive oil and decreased in 0.46 g Allouche, Jimenez, Gaforio, Uceda & Beltran (2007) found that, 6 h treatment (180\u00baC) of oil, palmitoleic, linoleic oleic acid was modified. Plaza et al. a significant decrease in avocado fatty acids content during 13 days of cold storage. In the case of TBARs, although a similar decrease was observed for both olive than to higher stability the oxi the gree of but also on al. phytosterols present in the oils. 13 The contribution of total tocopherols to ex tra virgin olive oil stability has been established to be around 9 % ( Aparicio, Roda, Albi & Gutierrez , 1999). D\u00b4Evoli et al. (2006) found a different sterol d e g r a d a t i o n r a t e o n e x t r a virgin olive oil with and without the addition of rosemary, with know n antioxidant properties. These 6h heating at 180\u00baC, remaining only 67 % of the initial amount present in olive oil. The experimental conditions used in that work (1 g sample heated) differed from our work (5 g could have definitively influenced the obtained results. As it can be seen in table 3, during the heating treatment, was depending on the oil. Only the compounds that appeared in low am ounts disappeared did not totally disappear. Regarding olive oil, after 3 h heating, a 93 % of the initial sitosterol content remained, whereas after 9 h, a 90 % remained. Regard ing avocado oil, a 76 % and 86 % of the initial sitosterol content remained after he ating According to what occurred with fatty acids of avocado oil at 9 h of heati ng, total phytosterols increased significantly. Winkler, Warner & Glynn (2007) in an paper over the effect of frying pear to be unrelated either to fatty acid composition or to the extent of oil degradation. Vitamin E is sensitive to heat treatment. It disappeared after 4 and 5 h of treatment in avocado and olive oil, respectively. The decr ease was quicker in avocado oil, reaching at 2-3 h a 57 % of loss, in contrast with the 26 % of loss in the case of olive oil. The decrease of vitamin E amounts showed th e increase of TBARs 14 during the first 6 h (R Pearson was -0.908 a n d - 0 . 9 1 2 f o r o l i v e a n d a v o c a d o o i l s , respectively; p<0.001).

Moreover properties have been demonstrated the PC12 2009). It seems clear that the effectiveness of Melissa in the prevention of neurological diseases, which are associated with oxidative stress, is related sausage, a cooked meat product , is very popular in Europe and it is one of the most consumed (Nowak, von Mu effling, Grotheer, Klein & are iron r they also show relatively high amounts of fat, sa turated fat and cholesterol, which have been related to some chronic diseases as diseas es 1997; 2000). to improve the lipid fraction of meat products, some of them of the main problems dealing with these needed for stabilizing meat products Astiasaran, 2006, 2007). However, due to health risks associated with its use and th e better perception of natural products by consumers, use of plant extracts with antioxidant activity is being under research. Carob extracts condensed tannins and grape seed were succesfully applied to deterioration hydroxy-tyrosol. extract from & of as al., 2010b). (2009) obtained the correlation antioxidant capacit y and chemical composition of plant extracts (Ibarra, Cases, Bily, He, Bai & 2010). reaching T\u00aa of 72-75\u00baC in the inner core of the products. This heat treatment, necessary from a microbiological and tec hnological point of view, might have a negative influence on the lipid fraction nutritional benefits of a new formulation for a Bologna-type sausage enriched in -3 fatty acids from linseed oil and to analyze the efficacy of a lyophilize d aqueous-ethanolic extract of Melissa officinalis as to prevent lipid deteriora tion. The influence of the heat treatment was also studied. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Materials Pork meat and back fat were obtained from a local meat market. Linseed oil (Biolasi Productos Naturales, Guip\u00fazcoa, Spain) was obtained in a local market and Melissa dried leaves were purchased from Plantaron S.L. (Barcelona, Spain). BD Rom Carne (a mixture of typical aromatic compounds) and the 50% (E-120) were obtained from BDF del Madrid, All the chem ical reagents were obtained from Sigma- Aldrich as follows: 50 g of dried leaves were weighted and added to 500 ml of ethanol (50%). The mixture was subjected to boiling reflux during 30 minutes. Ex traction process was re peated with another 500 ml of ethanol (50%), an d both extracts were pooled t ogether and completed with ethanol (50%) to a final volume of 1 freeze-dryer-cryodo (Tel star, Barcelona, Spain), a MDF-V5386S Ultra-Low-Temp erature (Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., Japan). 23 g of lyophilized material were obtai ned from 100 g of Melissa dried leaves. The lyophilized material was subsequently us ed as ingredient in the cooked product formulation. 2.2. Sausage formulation and processing Four a Melissa. total amount of each batch was 4 kg. Table 1 shows all ingredients of the control batc h and of the 3 modified batche s (Linseed, BHA and Melissa). All ingredients were thoroughly minced in a chilled cutter for 1 minute at low speed and 2 minutes at high speed until a complete emulsification of the mixture was obtained. After the application of a vacuum process to exclude oxygen from the mixture for 2 minutes, the batters were stuffed in 6 cm di ameter water impermeable plastic casings. A portion of the crude cooked in a water bath at 80\u00baC for 1 h, until the core of the product reached 72\u00baC. Once heating wa s complete, the sausages were immediately cooled in a water bath for 2 h and stored frozen (-20\u00baC) under vacuum till analysis. The experiment was done in triplicate. 72.3. Chemical analysis Characterization of antioxidant in the standard calibration curve dilutions between 0.005 and 2 Gallic acid (GA). The reaction mixture was composed of 0.1 ml of suitable dilu ted sample, 7.9 ml of distilled water, 0.5 ml of Folin-Ciocalteu\u00b4s reagent, and 1.5 ml of 20 % sodium carbonate anhydrous solution (added 2 minutes after After the initial mixing, the tubes were allowed to stand at room temperature fo r 2 hours in the dark. The optical density of the blue-colored resulting solution was m easured at 765 nm using a Lambda 5-UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Paris, France). The phenolic Pannala, Rece-Evans the the & was TBARs (Thiobarbituric acid values method described Masqsood The g), 0.5ml of distillate water, 20\u00b5L of BHT (1%) and the vortexed in a centrifuge tube after combining, for 30 sec, placed in a boiling water bath for exactly 15 min and then cooled in an ice bath to room temperature. Cyclohexa none (4 mL) and ammonium sulphate (1 mL, 4M) were added to the mixture and were vortexed for 30 sec. The mixture was centrifuged at room temperature at 4000 rpm for 10 minut es. The supernatant was collected and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. A ca libration curve TEP (tetraethoxypropane) was done for quantification procedure as with expressed in mg malondial dehyde (MDA) product. Index evaluation capacity of the 4 types of Bologna-type sausages was done both in the hydrophilic lipophilic fractions, using the ABTS method. of the m eat batters by lyophilizat ion was needed as a preparation (40 mL) for 1 h at room temperature in a rotary shaker. The resulting (note: ABTS pure ethanol). The Mattia, & Martino (2008): samples g) were to 150mL of methanol:chlor oform solution (2:1) kept in an ice bath and homogenized with an ul traturrax. The homogenate was put in an erlenmeyer, wrapped in an aluminum sheet and kept rotary shaker. The was filtered through filter paper, put in a funnel and added to 50 ml of physiologic results value the & Kerry (2008). Atherogenic Index (AI) and Thrombogenic In dex (TI) were calculated according to Ulbricht -3/-6)) 2.4. Sensorial analysis The sensorial acceptability of the Bologna type sausages was evaluated by an hedonic test. The test was carried out one da y after the preparation of the and were to score modified batches on a 1-9 co ntinuous point scale in which the degree of acceptability for different attributes was evaluated: colour, taste, texture and aroma. Furthermore, overall acceptability was al so assessed. A \"extreme dislike\" for samples as the reference value, ng a score of 5 points for every attribute. 2.5. Data analysis Data were analyzed using t student test for the evaluati on of the results obtained in each batch before and after the cooking process. A one way Anova test and the Tukey b posteriori test were used to determine significant differences among the different sausages. SPSS vers ion 15.0 was used (SPSS inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). Significance level of P 0.05 was used for all RESULTS Peroxide values (POV) and TBARs before and after the heat treatment were carried out in th e four types of products made in this work (Fig. 1 and 2). Products enriched in th POV (15 meq O for and differences compared to antioxidant s, in agreement with results shown in After Melissa and lower 12other that both antioxi dants are effici ent and have similar behaviour during heat trea tment. In the case of al. , 2008). With cooking, POV decreased in every product (Fig. 1), except in those PUFA enriched products that did not include BHA or a slight POV to the enriched a higher oxida tion susceptibility for products. Garc\u00eda values of 0.37 mg MDA/kg in \"mortadellas\" prepared with fish oil, alt hough in that work no differences were found in TBARs values of final products for assay fracti on that obta Di & measuring of poultry meat, observed, as well as in this paper, that the contribution of the hydrophilic fraction to the antioxi dant than that of the lipid soluble fraction. Meat is not considered as a source diet etic antioxidants. Deccker, 1999; Among the activity (0.97 mEqTrolox/g product). Cases, Billy, He, Bai & Rolle r (2010) pointed out the interest of the extraction procedures applied to plants rich in on the nature of the antioxidant composition and consequently, polyphenol of dry extract, which might have contributed to the highest AB TS in the developed meat products. Every modified product (with and and with from linseed the emulsions. of antioxidants, lipophilic fraction Melissa extract where a slight decrease was detected. the significant decrease in th e ABTS in product. Wu, it modified products needs the presence endogenous antioxidant the of Melissa extract over the BHA can be observed both, before and after cooking. profile Regarding fatty the traditional ones (Table 2). Fr om the 25 different fatty acids analyzed, only 3 did not total amount of acids wa s about 1% in all products. The greatest change was observed for -linolenic acid, as a consequence of the addition of linseed oil. A 10-fold increment in this fatty acid was observe d in modified cooked products in relation to the control ones, without differenc es between Linseed batc h and Melissa batch. No effect of the use of antioxidants was the of modified products could that they are \"high omeg a-3 fatty acids\", as they contain more than 0.6 g -linolenic acid 100 g. Effectively, the amount of This fatty acid has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and it is a nutritionally one Furthermore, SEN (Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Nutr ici\u00f3n- 2010) suggests that -linolenic acid should cover a 0.5% of the total daily energy value, which would be 1.1g/day, in a mentioned of modified products would cover As a consequence of the -linolenic increment, the two major fatty acids present in aver age, and oleic acid decreased between 7 and 10%. These modifications were obviously re flected in changes of some interesting ratios. Wood et al. (2004) reported recommended PUFA/SFA ratio above 0.4, range 1-1.5 to be considered favourable to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (Kang et al., 2005). Polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids rati products in which closer values. More relevant changes were observed for -6/-3 ratio control (17.27) and the rest of the products (1.84-1.96). The current recommenda tion for this ratio according nutritional guidelines is around 4 (Simopoulos, 2002). These results can be considered as successful lattets being substituted all of pork fat of control frankfurter with an wate r emulsion, which contained olive il, fish oil. They obtained frankfurters with 17.70g -linolenic per 100 g of fat. decrease of SFA and the increase of PUFAs, specially the of -3 PUFAs, were significant. acids have also dietary (U lbricht & Southgate, 1991). The index of atherogenicity (AI) and the index of thromboge nicity (TI) take into account the different effects of the different fatty acids on 0.38 to around 0.31 the AI, and from 1.03 to 0.54 the TI (Table 2), which wa s considered positiv e from the health standpoint. Sensorial analysis In order to assess the acceptability of the linseed containing products, an hedonic sensorial test was carried out. analysis results of the new formulations revealed significant differenc es were observed for and aroma for all linseed contai ning products compared to control ones. A slightly lower score was noticed for the batch with Melissa extract, for colour and acceptability, that used with the Ciencia e Inno vaci\u00f3n), and \"Plan Investigador de la Universidad de Navarra\" (P IUNA) for their contribution to the financial support of this work.
