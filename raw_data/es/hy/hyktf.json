San Clemente, CA) contains a proprietary blend of the botanical Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and several herbal antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances. SS has been purported to accelerate tissue repair and restore muscle function following resistance exercise. Here, we examine the effects of SS supplementation on strength adaptations resulting from a 12-week resistance training program in healthy young adults. Methods Twenty-four young adults (16 males, 8 females, mean age = 20.5 \u00b1 1.9 years, mass = 70.9 \u00b1 11.9 kg, stature = 176.6 \u00b1 9.9 cm) completed the twelve week training program. The study design was a double-blind, placebo controlled parallel group trial. Subjects either received placebo or StemSport supplement (SS; mg/day) during the training. 1-RM bench press, 1-RM leg press, vertical jump height, balance (star excursion and center of mass excursion), isokinetic strength (elbow and knee flexion/extension) and perception of recovery were measured at baseline and following the 12-week training intervention. Results Resistance training increased 1-RM strength (p < 0.008), vertical jump height (p < 0.03), and isokinetic strength (p < 0.05) in both SS and placebo groups. No significant group-by-time interactions were observed (all p-values >0.10).

No significant group-by-time interactions were supplement did example, within session promotes with There the literature concerning how herbal supplements impact the magnitude of their benefits StemTech International, Inc. San al., In Review, JISSN). Our study reported that compared to a placebo, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h (1 week) post-eccentric exercise (Rynders et al., In Review, JISSN). There were no differences in measures of recovery between SS and placebo after DOMS, yet it is possible that the amount of muscle tissue damage elicited by DOMS protocol that the enhance would lead to a greater response (i.e. greater total work completed per workout session). The present placebo-controlled study examined the effects of SS supplementation muscle We hypothesized SS would accelerate the rate of recovery from each training session, allowing for a greater overload in subsequent training sessions, and an enhanced training response. Methods Experimental approach to the problem This was blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design to training adaptations following a 12-week resistance training program. Independent variables included supplement type (SS or Placebo) and measurement period (pre- and post- 12 weeks of training). Dependent variables included 1 repetition max (1RM) bench press and concentric knee and elbow flexion and extension; and perception of recovery. Subjects The enrolled an introductory strength training class, and had not participated in more than 1 day/week of resistance consent and kidney supplements; and self-reported randomly assigned to receive either the active SS supplement (n = 17) or placebo (n = 18). The SS ingredient list is presented in Table extract 3 times per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) and 1575 mg of a proprietary herbal/botanical blend twice per day (breakfast and dinner). dose of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and one of instructions. Subjects were required to maintain a instructed to forfeit any capsules not ingested during the study period. Supplements (SS and placebo) were dispensed weekly by the subjects in the SS condition and one subject in the placebo condition withdrew prior to beginning the training intervention. Five subjects in the SS condition withdrew during the 12-week training program due to injury (n = 1), an adverse reaction to the supplement (n = 1), or time constraints (n = 3). Three subjects in the placebo condition withdrew during to time subjects completed the twelve week training (12-weeks) testing consisted press, isokinetic concentric phase peak torque and average power for knee and elbow flexion and extension, vertical jump, SEBT, and static balance. 1RM testing The IRM testing was performed using the National Strength and Conditioning [6](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR6)]. Participants began 1RM bench press and leg warming up with repetitions on the bench press using a 20.5-kg bar and free weights or dumbbells, and multiple repetitions on the leg press machine (Hammer Strength, Schiller Park, IL, USA). The goal was to build to the 1RM load within five attempts. For the bench press, a successful repetition was scored the weight was lowered to the chest and raised to full arm extension without losing foot, hip, back, or shoulder contact with the bench of the floor without help provided by a spotter. For the leg press, a successful repetition was the created a 90\u00b0 angle raised to full leg extension without the subject losing back or shoulder contact with the machine and without spotter assistance. Two used for each of the isokinetic exercises, with a 90 second rest interval between sets. Verbal encouragement was given for each repetition, and testing was preceded with 10 to 15 practice repetitions to familiarize the subject with the isokinetic device. Each exercise was conducted at angular velocities of 60 and 180 degrees per second (deg.sec1). The isokinetic knee flexion and extension tests were performed from full knee extension (0\u00b0) to 90\u00b0 flexion. The isokinetic elbow flexion and extension tests were performed from full elbow extension (0\u00b0) to 160\u00b0 of flexion. For all tests, the seatback angle was set at 85\u00b0, and the hips were in 90\u00b0 of flexion. For each motion, peak torque and average power from the 3 sets were averaged prior to statistical analysis. Static balance Static balance was single-limb stance on their dominant leg with eyes open and then closed for 15 seconds. Subjects were instructed to stand as still as possible with arms folded across their chest, holding the opposite limb at 45\u00b0 of knee flexion and 30\u00b0 of hip flexion. If the subject touched down with the non-stance limb, made contact with the stance limb, or was unable to maintain standing posture during 15-s trial, the and repeated. Traditional center of pressure by the 10-s trial time) and the area of the 95% confidence ellipse of COP excursions were calculated via computer for the three eyes-open and eyes-closed trials were used for statistical analysis. trained single limb stance on the test limb while reaching as far as possible with the contralateral limb in the given direction, made a light touch on the line at their point of maximum reach, and returned to the starting position. Subjects performed trials each reaching limb, removed the stance foot from the starting position, or lost balance. Reach distance were normalized Vertical jump Subjects performed trials a resistance training 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Subjects performed 2 sets of 10 exercises using a combination of free weights and machines. When the subject was able to successfully perform 2 sets of 10 repetitions for an exercise, the weight was increased by 5 to 25 pounds at the next training session. The same 10 exercises were performed each training session for 4 weeks, and then modified (i.e. lunges to split squats). Examples of bench training was assessed using a visual analog scale throughout the 12-week training program at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Subjects were instructed to make a vertical line at the position on the scale to represent their perceived recovery from training, with the left end point labeled \"completely recovered\" and the all\". The measured distance of the marked from the left end point served as the score and normalized by by (Shapiro-Wilk p-value < 0.05) were Separate 2-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures over time was executed with the treatment group (SS or placebo) as the independent variable. For the performance tests, the dependent variable was the respective outcome measure. Thus, there was 1 between-subjects factor (treatment group) and 1 within-subjects factor (time). For the perception of recovery scale, the dependent variable was the the total length of the scale. Scales were completed at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12; thus there was 1 between-subjects factor (treatment group) and 7 within-subjects factors. Where significant main effects were observed, were applied examine group were conducted to examine differences in adherence where the number of training sessions completed served as the dependent threshold for significance for all tests was set at p < 0.05. Results Adherence to training There was no significant difference between groups in adherence to training assessed by the number of training sessions completed (30.3 sessions for placebo, 29.8 sessions for SS, p = 0.50), or adherence to treatment assessed by the percentage of of pills p = 0.10). 1-RM Figures [1](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#Fig1) and [2](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#Fig2) display the individual and mean responses for 1 RM bench press and 1 RM leg press. Bench press 1-RM increased by 18.2% (p = 0.008) with placebo and 11.0% with S (p = 0.001). Leg press 1-RM increased by 48.6% with placebo (p < 0.001) and by 50.5% with SS (p < 0.001). There were no differences in 1-RM improvement (bench press and leg press) between placebo and SS conditions (p-values > 0.28). Similar results were observed body weight (data in Table [2](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#Tab2)). Vertical jump Vertical jump increased 7.2% with placebo (p = 0.03) and 10.6% with SS (p =0.001), but no significant (p > 0.05; Table [2](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#Tab2)). and extension strength improved in the placebo condition compared to only two measures in the SS condition (Table [2](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#Tab2)). No pre- to post-training improvements were observed the measures of isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength. Post hoc tests revealed decrements in of two of the eight measures of isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength in the SS condition (Table [2](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#Tab2)). Balance There was a significant improvement in eyes open center of pressure excursion velocity in the placebo condition, but not for SS. SEBT measures did not improve perception of recovery scores for both conditions. There was a significant effect of time (p < 0.001) on perception of recovery, but no significant group by time interaction (p in assisting the recovery process, enhancing the natural renewal process\" [ [8](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR8)]. In the present study we tested the manufacturer claims and hypothesized that if the claims were accurate, recovery in response to the SS supplement would performance in subsequent training response and larger strength gains. The major findings of the present study were, 1) twelve weeks of strength training significantly improved muscle strength and function did not provide additional benefits above resistance training alone. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the effects of SS supplementation in response to purported primary ingredient of an extract of the fresh water botanical Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA). AFA has been shown to increase the circulating level of human [10](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR10)]. Significant increases proliferation of cultures of human bone marrow cells and human CD34+ stem cell with in vitro administration of AFA [ [10](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR10)]. In a randomized double-blind controlled crossover of but increase in concentrations CD34+ cells, peaking at 25% baseline at 1 hour, with only minor fluctuations observed a placebo condition [ [9](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR9)]. No measurements of circulating stem cells were collected in the present study, and thus the role of stem cells in the recovery from resistance training remains unclear. The supplementation protocol failed to produce any improvements placebo, suggesting that the transient increase in circulating stem associated with SS promote stem typically observed do not play a significant role in recovery from resistance training, or that SS did not adequately increase circulating stem cells. StemSport contains a SS on recovery from resistance training, although the effects of other anti-oxidative and strength bout. Anti-oxidant supplementation was not associated E supplementation compared to placebo occurred after 6 yet the adults Although not measured the study, a prior study using the DOMS model indicated that SS finding the present study demonstrated significant reductions in the perception of recovery from resistance training after 4 weeks, with only minor fluctuations observed throughout the rest of the 12 week period. Flann et al. [ [22](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR22)] reported week \"ramp up\" period. An unexpected finding of the present study was the lack of significant change in most measures of knee isokinetic strength or power, with both groups demonstrating small decrements after the training period (Table is inconsistent (and [ significant improvement in leg press All testing for each subject was performed in the same order during the pre- and post-testing sessions, yet the possibility exists that subjects may have been more fatigued from the 1RM testing during the post-training tests compared to the pre-testing sessions. Limitations to the present study include: 1) diet, which can have a significant impact adaptations resistance training [ gains in more athletes, recent review of 250 commercially advertised supplements found only been examined studies greater than 3 weeks in duration [ [5](/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-11-23#ref-CR5)].
