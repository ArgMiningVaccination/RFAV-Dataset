There are also small quantities in both aloes of the material of interest here is aloe dried juice, which is prepared by cutting transversely the leaf near the base and taking it inclined so that the juice contained in pericyclic cells and sometimes in the adjacent parenchyma flow out in about 6 h. The juice is allowed to dry with or without the aid of heat. Aloe gel is a colourless mucilaginous gel obtained from the parenchymatous cells of the leaves. The mucilaginous parenchymous tissue is excised from fresh leaves. Therefore the leaves are \"filleted\", that means that the external gree n parts peeled. the anthranoid -containing cells beneath are also removed, the gel is free of anthranoids or not.

Information on documented medicinal use and historical data from literature In the available data on traditional use, it is not always possible differentiate it to be likely that not aloe dried juice were externally used. Because of this all traditional indications reported for \"aloe\" altogether. Aloe has a long history as a medicine and skin care aid. For over 6,000 years aloe was used for a wide range of aloe early Greeks used it for blisters, well as stomach disorders. Legend i s that Aristotle persuaded Alexander the Great to conquer the Isle of Socroto to secure enough Aloe ve ra to heal his soldiers' wounds. In England aloe was already used in century. In the 12th century was brought to Germany by Madaus, Aloe is a purgative for eyes. It is good for headache administered with vinegar and rose ointme nt on the forehead and temples. Together with vine it slows up hair loss. For inflammation of the mouth and tonsils, it is mixed with honey and vine. The British Pharmaceutical Codex (1911) mentions aloe as a purgative : because the action of on the la intestine induces some pelvic is therefore employed in amenorrhoea, generally with iron. The recommended dose is 1 to 3 decigrams (2 to 5 grains). In the Dispensatory of the United States of America 1918 aloe is mentio ned as a cathartic (purgative). the treatment of various forms it is extremely aloe exercises any action upon not attributable to its cathartic effects (Remington & Wood, 1918) . his be given by enema. Hager (1925) mentions the use as an appetising agent in low doses (0.05 - 0.1 g) and as a cathartic in higher doses (0.2 - 1.0 g). The use in menstr uation, pregnancy and bleeding haemorrhoids of the pelvis organs. The use as a clysma and as an eye ointment or powder is not very common (Frerichs et al. 1925) . Madaus (1938) gives a review of the as di scribed above. Paracelsus already indicated the gout and external use in inflammation s of the eyes. In Estonia aloe was sometimes used for tuberculosis. Koenen (1977) described the Engler\" aqueous extract complains of digestion ans used aloe for syphilis and for inflammations of the eyes ( Watt et al., 1962). The WHO monograph \"Aloe\" mentions the following uses described experimental clinical data: treatment of seborrhoeic u lcers, of sugar levels. The references given are not original sources and date from 1991 and 1995. The accepted historical use of \"Aloe\" led to the establishment of German Commission E monograph anthranoid - containing laxatives of 21 June 1996, which were intended to set a framewo rk for of HAD produce children over 10 years: preparations equivalent to 10 -30 mg HAD to be taken once daily at night.

WHO Monographs on Selected Medicinal Plants - Volume 1 , 1999 Assessment report 10/56 2.3. Overall conclusions medicinal use For over 6,000 years aloe was used for a wide range of ailments. Besides the most important use as a laxative, the use as an emmenagogue and the external use for wounds already mentioned in the Dispensatory of the United States of America 1918, it is extremely doubtful whether aloe exercises any action upon attributable to its cathartic effects (Remington & Wood , 1918) . There are no plausible pharmacological data for this indication, nor for haemoptysis, jaundice or gout, etc. Concerning the exactly the preparations used. Hydroxyanthracene derivatives are a group of natural constituents the pharmacologic action of which is accepted in literature. They are substantially contributing to the as laxative medicinal marketing authorizations and with respect to an acceptable level of safety (see later sections) the well not fulfilled. With respect to traditional use there are no defined preparation for external use, in other cases the traditional use is not plausible (see later sections).

Non-Clinical Data 3.1. Overview of available pharmacological data regarding administration to rats, aloe produced in 20% rats of 5 g/kg bw and in 100% rats at doses of 20 g/kg bw. Lower doses of aloe (0.1 and 1.0 g/kg) did not pro duce a diarrhoeal response. Pre -treatment h after its oral administration. The increase in water (0.1 - 20.0 effect preparations Izzo et al (Izzo , 1996) and 1997 (Izzo et al. , 1997) they investigated the role of NO in senna - and cascara- induced diarrhoea in the rat, and in 1999 (Izzo et al., 1999) the role of NO in aloe -induced diarrhoea in the rat. In the study of Wintola et al. (2010) , the efficacy of an aqueous total leaf extract of Aloe fe rox Mill. the dried leaves were grinded into powder and 100 g of the material was extracted by shaking for 24 h in 1000 ml of distilled water, filtered freeze dried and reconstituted in body weight) the received normal saline. The constipated rats were treated with 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day of the extract for 7 day s during which the feeding characteristics, body weight, f aecal motility, increased in the constipated rats. The study o f Ashafa et al. (2011) evaluated the effect of an ethanolic leaf vera against loperamide -induced constipation in A thoroughly washed with Assessment slices, and air -dried at room te mperature to a constant weight. The dried leaves were grinded into a powder and 40 g of the material was extracted by shaking it for 24 h in 500 ml of ethanol. The extract obtained was filtered through Whatman no. 1 (70 mm) filter paper and concentrated on a water bath at 45\u00b0C to give a yield of 5.2 g (hydroxyanthracene content (HAD) unknown). This was reconstituted in distilled water to give the required doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight for the experiment (relation not known). Rats induced administration of loperamide (3 mg/kg body weight) while the control animals received normal saline. Constipated rats were treated with 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight/day of the ethanolic leaf extract for 7 days characteristics, body weight, f aecal transit were monitored. Treatment of constipated rats with the extract at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight for 7 days improved intestinal motility, increased f aecal ume, and weight constipated rats. These are indications of the laxative property of the herb with the 200 mg/kg body weight of the extract showing the best effect. Assessor\u00b4s Comment content are ported. Extracts were peutically active form during intestine passage. A broad set of literature data is describing details of the generally acknowledged mode of action, which is explaining the therapeutic usage as laxatives. Ishii et al. significant it seemed that the increase in water rat large intestine produced by aloe -emodin was of secretion without stimu the concomitant increase in residual fluid volume, other multiple m echanisms of action might be involved in the increase of water content in the rat large intestine. Hoenig et al. (1992) and Rauwald et al . (1992) studied the influence of and that the inhibition of Cl--channels' -anthrone -emodin. These anthraquinones reduce the - permeability of the cells, this influence being sometimes more pronounced that of blocker In contrast to the investigations of Ishii Y al. (1990) both substances showed inhibition. Results investigations isolated colon suggest that the laxative properties of aloin and in part, on increased prostaglandin synthesis by the intestinal tissue. Tavares et al. (1996) compared the effects of rhein and aloe- emodin with and calcium ionophore on platelet- vitro. Ricinoleic acid PAF from human Assessment \u00b5g/ml) stimulated a small release of PAF in ileum and colon mucosa. Rhein had no effect. 5 -aminosalicylic acid (100 \u00b5g/ml) inhibited PAF release rhein exerted laxative effects by a mechanism that did not involve PAF release, and that aloe -emodin may act partly via PAF release. Izzo et al. (1998) reviewed t he key features of the involvement of NO and PAF in the action of laxatives. PAF is a phospholipid mediator of inflammation secretion in in isolated preparations of human colon. NO, synthesised from the amino L -arginin e, Oral administration of sennosides (20 -30 mg/kg) to fasted dogs has been shown to induce a strong and long -lasting inhibition of myoelectric colon activity which was evident after delay of 6 -10 h corresponding to oro- caecal colonic diarrh oea. When were given 1 h before meal, the contractions' with a high amplitude appeared during the period of inhibition. Most of these single contractions were propagated over the second half of the colon at a velocity of 0.5 -2 cm/min. Elimination of liquid f These specific (2002) monograph \"Aloe today\" (part four) to recent tha t produced a better explanation of the mechanism of the action of stimulus on the colon. The inhibition of Na+/K+ -ATPase and the release of NO are relevant to stimulate the secretion of electrolytes and muscles. outlined that plays role regarding PAF, which causes the The authors summarized that biological factors such as PAF and NO may play a role on the action of the stimulus on the colon, but it should be considered that the investigations were only experimental ones. Ishii et al. (1994) measured simultaneously in the same rat charcoal transport, as an indicator of the degree of peristalsis, and water content in the large int estine administration of barbaloin. Charcoal transport was significantly accelerated at both 3.5 and 6.5 h ours after the administration of barbaloin. At 6.5 h, diarrhoea instead of normal faeces was observed. Moreover, at 1 h before the a cceleration of charcoal transport, a marked increase in water content of the large intestine was observed: It appeared that the increase in more important factor than of 23.2 mumol kg -1 in mice (= 1.0 the mixture. At same dose, rhein anthrone net water but could not reverse it to the net secretion at 1/2 dose. The mixture significantly decreased net water absorption and reversed to the net secretion at this dose. These anthrones did not stimulate in the from synergistic stimulation of large intestinal transit and large intestinal water secretion (Yagi et al. , 1997). The exact mechanism of action is still unknown. Besides a dire ct influence of the motility leading a reduced transit an influence and stimulation of secretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen of the colon (secretagogue effect) may result in enhanced concentrations of fluid and electrolytes in the lumen of the colon. The fluid absorption is reduced. This may lead to an increase intestine presented here to support the pharmacodynamic concept and metabolism for the laxative effect. For more details see section 3.2. To determine uptake active aloe the following study. The Caco- 2 cell monolayer and the everted similar in two models; more aloesin was absorbed in the everted gut sac than in the Caco monolayer. These provide aloe effective plasma (Park et al., 2009) Pharmakokinetic studies by Lang ( 1993) after oral to male female the dose was excreted in the urine and the rest was excreted in the faeces as rhein and conjugates. 10% of the radioactivity was identified as free aloe- emodin in the plasma with a maximum peak at 1.5 -3.0 h after the administration. Only the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract showed higher concentrations than the plasma. The terminal half -life of the radioactivity in the blood was 50 h ours. In contrast Ishii et al. showed that aloe -emodin -9-anthrone was produced in the rat large intestine (Ishii et al., 1994, Ishii et al., 1999). Aloe- emodin -9-anthrone is the main active metabolite, which acts specifically on the colon ( Ishii et al., 1990). Administration of emodin to i.v. bolus well described by a two -compartment model. The AUC 518 was 72.3 ml/min, and elimination half -life 227 min which was much longer than that reported in a previous study.

Aloe-emodin anthrone and Rhein anthrone Intracecal Mice Rhein anthrone significantly stimulated disturbed the equilibrium between the absorption of water from the intestinal lumen via inhibition of active sodium/potassium adenosine (Ish ii et al. , 1994) and led to secret ion of water into the lumen by a prostaglandin -dependent mechanism (Capasso et al. , 1983). The result net reduction in but, in contractions' with amplitude Secondary experi mental which study several effects of different ingredients of aloe. The part of the plant, from which the ingredients were isolated, has not always been defined exactly.

(2001, 2005) demonstrated that aloe -emodin induced a significant cell apoptosis -related proteins compared to those of order to assess the role of oxidative stress in emodin, danthron, and lamb line, with an increase in their E(1)7. A close parallelism was found between the reactivity of hydroxyanthraquinones an of oxidative stress in the toxicity of hydroxyanthraquinones in these ce ll lines, which was further evidenced by the Guinea, 2003).

Overview of pharmak okinetic and B, hydroxyaloins and the aloinoside s A and B are not absorbed in the upper gut. In humans, they pass into the colon unmodified after oral ingestion. Human intestinal flora are able to break down O -glycosides easily but only to some extent C -glycosides anthranoids. A strictly anaerob ic , Eubacterium sp.

Aloe- the main active metabolite, which acts specifically on the colon (Ishii et al. , 1990). It is not known to what extent alo e-emodin -9-anthrone is absorbed. In the case of senna, animal experiments with radio -labeled rhein anthrone administered directly into and Lemli After oral administration of 4.5 mg/kg 14C -aloe-emod in to rats 20 - 30% of the dose was excreted in urine and the rest in faeces. quickly to rhein, to an unknown metabolite and to conjugates of all three. In the plasma about 10% of 14C -activity was identified as free aloe - emodin. Maximum plasma values were reached 1.5 - 3 h p.a. with 248 (male) and 441 (female) ng equivalents aleo- emodin/ml. Maximum concentrations in plasma were about 3 times higher than those in ovaries and 10 times higher in testes. the low activity in the reproductive organs TLC analysis was not possible. But if the metabolic profile of these organs is assumed to be the same as in plasma, concentrations of free aloe -emodin can be calculated to be maximally about 2 -4 ng/g in t estes and 8 -10 ng/g in ovaries after an oral dose of 4.5 mg/kg. liver, kidney and intestinal tract higher concentrations than plasma. Terminal half -life (for radioactivity) in blood was about 50 h (Lang , 1993). The absorbed rhein anthrone is gl ucuronidised in the liver. One part of the glucuronides is excreted via the urine and cause the yellow or red -brown discolouration of the urine. The other part is excreted via the bile (Lemli et al. , of aloe to maintain an plasma level (Park et al., 2009) . Pharmacokinetic studies by Lang ( 1993) after to male female the dose was excreted in the urine and the rest was excreted in the faeces as rhein and conjugates. 10% of the radioactivity was identified as free aloe- emodin in the 22/56 plasma with a maximum peak at 1.5 -3.0 h after the administration. Only the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract showed higher concentrations than the plasma. The terminal half -life of the radioactivity in the blood was 50 h ours. Administration of emodin to rabbits by i.v. bolus resulte in a serum profile which could be well described by a two -compartment model.

Three female rats died before the end of the study. Mean body weights of males and females exposed to 5,500 ppm or greater were significantly less than those of the controls. Feed consumption by males and f emales receiving 17,000 or 50,000 ppm was decreased throughout the Macroscopic lesions were present in the kidney of rats exposed to 17,000 or 50,000 ppm. 16-day study in mice : Groups of five male and five female mice were fed diets containing 2,000, 5,500, 17,000, or 50,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 120, 400, 1,200, or 3,800 mg/kg to males and 140, 530, 1,600, or 5,000 mg/kg to females; 50,000 ppm equivalents were not calculated due to high mortality). All mice exposed to 50,000 ppm died before the end of the study. Mice in the 17,000 ppm groups lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 5,500 ppm females was greater than that by the controls throughout the study. Macroscopic lesions were present in the gallbladder and kidney of mice exposed to 17,000 ppm. 14-week study in rats : Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were fed diets containing 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 80, 170, or 300 mg/kg to males and females).

Data on hydroxyanthracene vitro derivatives (HAD ) were investigated in the evaluation C3H/M2 compounds were mutagenic in strain TA1537, but only a few were active in other strains. Among these were HA D with a hydroxymethyl group, such as lucidin and aloe -emodin. In V79 cells, only HA D with 2 hydroxy grou ps in the 1 .3 positions mutagenic.

Carcinogenicity Data on herbal study of Aloe, Aloe arborescens Miller var. natalensis assessment of toxicity and carcinogenic potential in the diet at doses of 4% or 0.8% in groups of male and female Wistar Hannover rats. The whole Aloe orescens, the same grade used as a food additive was mixed at concentrations 0.0% (Control), 0.8%, aloenin in the whole leaf powder after storage for 2 weeks were 0.83% and 1.91%, respectively. The concentrations of alo in and aloenin in the pelleted diet after 2 weeks of storage at room temperature were 0.0009% and 0.0022% for the examination showed increase of RBC, Hb, and Alb in the 4% males. The cause of these increases could conceivably have been dehydration through diarrhoea . AST and Na were significantly decreased in the males receiving 4%, and Cl was significantly decreased in both 4% and 0.8% males. A/G was significantly increased in the 4% females, Cl significantly in colon , and rectum were obser ved in 4% males but not in the 0.8% and control male groups. Similarly, in females, adenomas in the colon were also observed in the 4% but not 0.8% and control groups. In conclusion, t 4% high- dose level on colon in the 2 years carcinogenicity study in rats. The authors concluded and level on colon is probably due to irritation of the intestinal tract by diarrh oea (Yokohira et al., 2009) The National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) conducted 14 -day, 13- week, and the leaf extracts of Aloe vera plants. Aloe vera plant -irradiated to preserve quality. No other additives were used in their preparation. Solutions of non -decolorized extracts of Aloe vera leaves (DER and HAD content unknown) were added to the drinking water to groups of rats and mice for 2 years. Groups of 48 rats received solutions 0.5% (= extract kg bw per day, 1% or 1.5% of Aloe vera extract in th e drinking water, and groups of mice received solutions containing 1%, 2%, or 3% = 11. 8 g Aloe leaf extract/kg bw/day of whole leaf Aloe vera extract. Similar groups of animals were given plain drinking water and served as the control groups. At the end of the study tissues from more than 40 sites were examined for every animal. In all groups of rats and mice receiving the Aloe vera extract, large intestine were markedly increased compared to the control animals. There were a lso increases in hyperplasia in the small intestine though had been seen in the control groups of rats for this and other studies at this laboratory. The authors concluded that nondecolorized whole leaf aloe extract, its composition and the posology ar e unknown. In this 2 years rat study, treatment (max. dose 11.8 g Aloe vera leaves extract/kg bw/day) related neoplasms limited large adenomas and carcinomas confined within the mucosal wall of the large intestine and did not metastasize to regional mesenteric lymph nodes or more distant sites. However, in association with the whole set of existing d ata they contribute to the concern about genotoxicity carcinogenicity divided into four groups: Group A, the control rats fed a semi- synthetic diet without Aloe vera ; containing freeze- dried and given whole leaf charcoal -processed Aloe vera (0.02%) causes of death, slightly lower incidence of fatal chronic nephropathy compared with Group A rats.

In 2001 the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published a technical report on toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of 65 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 280, 830, or 2,500 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 110, 320, or 1,000 mg/kg to males and 120, 370, or 1,100 mg/kg to females). Ten male and ten female rats from each group necropsied at 6 from five male and five female rats in each group were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months for plasma emodin concentrations; these rats were necropsied at ody weights, and f eed consumption: Survival of exposed males and females was similar to that of the controls. The mean body weights of rats in the 2,500 ppm groups were less than those of the controls beginning at week 2 of the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar t o that by the controls throughout the study. Pathology f incidence exceeded the range observed for current historical controls and was considered an equivocal f inding. At the 6 - and 12- month interim evaluations and at 2 years, of renal all tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all e xposed groups of males at 2 years. There were negative trends in the incidences of mononuclear female rats, the 2,500 ppm groups were significantly decreased. In females exposed to 2,500 ppm, the incidence w as below the historical control range; the incidence in males exposed to 2,500 ppm was at the lower end of the historical control range. Assessment report on 60 male mice were fed diets containing 0, 160, 312, or 625 ppm emodin (equivalent to a verage daily doses of approximately 15, 35, or 70 mg/kg). Groups of 60 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm emodin (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Ten male and ten female m ice from each group were necropsied at 12 Survival, Feed Consumption and mean body weights of exposed males and females were similar to those of the controls. No differences in feed consumption were noted between exposed and control groups. Pathology Findings: Low incidences of renal tubule exposed male mice; these incidences included one carcinoma each in the 312 and 625 ppm groups. Renal tubule neoplasms are rare in male mice, and their presence in these groups suggested a possible association with emodin exposure. the severity of nephropathy was slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm. Also at 12 months, the severity of nephropathy increased fro m minimal in the lower groups mild in females exposed to 1,250 incidence in this group was significantly increased compared to the control group. At 2 years, the severities of nephropathy were slightly increased in males exposed to 625 ppm and females exposed to 1,250 ppm. The incidences of nephropathy were significantly increased in all exposed groups females. At the month interim tubule pigmentation were significantly increased in all exposed groups of males and in females exposed to 625 or 1,250 ppm. The severities increased with increasing exposure conflicting genotoxicity, it was noted the first and need metabolic a genotoxic form. - hydroxyemodin act s as the genotoxin (NTP , 2001). The occurrence of intestinal tumours in rats has been reported by Mori et al. (1985) following dietary chrysazin 16 months at the concentration of 1%.

Of these, 7 rats developed intestinal tumours of the colon and caecum were frequently encountered in treated animals both with and without intestinal the liver of several rats, g of chrysazin was performed in 1986 al. ) in C3H/HeN mice by dietary administration for 540 days of 0.2% since mice did not tolerate larger doses (1% and 0.5%). All the mice that were given the chemical and hyperplasia of the caecum and colon. These lesions were not seen in animals of the control group. Some of the hyperplastic lesions were difficult to malignancies in various models. The therefore less sensitive than rat intestine to the carcinogenic action of the chemical. neoplasms were also seen in the control group. The authors therefore concluded al. promotion, Th danthron, aloe and chrysophanol, may have tumour -promoting activities. The aim of the study of Sch\u00f6rkhuber et al.

(Beya intragastric administration of sennosides at a dose of 2, 10, 20, 50, 100 mg/kg to pregnant rats and rabbits there was no evidence of any embryolethal, teratogenic or fetotoxic action. Furthermore, sennosides had no effect on the postnatal development of young animals, on the rear ing behaviour of mother animals or on male or female fertility (Mengs electromyography in healthy adult ewes 70 and 120 pregnancy assess possible disturbances of diarrhoea was systematically obtained with doses greater than 20 mg/kg and was connected with a marked depression of both ileum and spiral colon motility.

In the pathogenesis of constipation the colon plays a key role because this is where the contents of the gut remain for 24 - 48 hours. During this period the liquid contents from the small intestine are converted into faeces by absorption of water and electrolytes in response to the action of bacteria.

Test person A experienced soft stools once at day 1 and 2 and normal stools at day 3. Test person E experienced soft stools at day 1 for four times. Test person H experienced soft stools once at day 1, 2 and 3. These different results corresponded to the cleavage of aloin an oral ferric product additionally. This product seemed to support the cleavage of aloin. This was confirmed when test person A received a ferric product The The aloe preparation in this combination product and other anthraquinone of 500 mg were made up to contain the active ingredients celandine, A loe vera and psyllium in the ratio 6:3:1. Thirty five men and women randomised to receive capsules containing celandine- Aloe vera -psyllium, or placebo, in a double - blind trial including a 14 -day basal period and a 28 -day treatment period. Twenty one of these had simple constipation, and the others suffer ed from irritable bowel successfully completed the study.

Jacobs and White (1998) examined the associations of colon cancer with constipation and use of commercial laxatives in a case -control study among men and women aged 30 - 62 years (424 incident cases and 414 random -digital- dial controls). Constipation was defined by \"feeling constipated to the point of having to take something \". The adjusted relative risk (RR) was 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2 -3.6] for constipation 12 -51 times per year, and 4.4 (95%CI = 2.1- 8.9) for constipation 52 or more times a year. Cumulative lifetime use of commercial laxatives was also associated with increased risk of colon cancer. When adjusted for constipation, commercial laxative use was no longer associated wi th increased risk (RR = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.1- 0.9 for less than 350 uses; RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.4 -2.3 for 350 or more uses).

According to the recommendations fibre in childhood, children than fibre (increased consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, cereal and other grain product) to an amount equal or greater than their age plus 5 g (e.g. 8 g/day at age 3) (Williams et al., 1994). Change in nutrition should be accompanied with behaviour modification, e.g. are no systematic use as a laxative in children. According to the ESCOP and WHO m onographs, the use in children under 10 years of age cannot be recommended. According to the \"Note for set to of age\". 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology (please refer to the assessment report on \"Cassia senna L. and Cassia angustifolia V ahl, folium\") support the efficacy of these anthranoid -containing herbal substances for short -term use in occasional constipation. or tumorigenic risk the daily dose and the duration of administration were limited and children, pregnant women and nursing mothers were excluded from the application of aloe containing The results the most and the question of a of long -term use anthranoid -containing laxatives is still open. Some studies revealed a risk for colorectal cancer associated with the of anthraquinone -containing laxatives, studies did of anthranoid -containing medicinal products leads to the development over a period of 4 - 13 months of pseudomelanosis coli - pigmentation of the gut wall in the caecum and colon. This condition is produced by the accumulation of macrophages that have stored a pigment breakdown products of anthranoid (probably lipofuscin) and cause the chronic constipation of duration of use. Assessment report 96 age- -matched subjects without intestinal disease (controls) were interviewed on their history of constipation and anthranoid laxative use. coli a were investigated on sigmoid mucosa in patients with SC or DD. Constipation and anthranoid laxative use were similar between patients with SC (30.9% and 32.7%, respectively) and those with among con found in 38.2% of patients with SC and in 39% of those with DD. Mean ACF frequency was higher in patients with SC (0.24/cm(2)) than in those with DD (0.10/cm(2); P < 0.0001), it did not vary according const ipation, laxative use, or melanosis coli in either group.

However, these symptoms may also occur generally as a cases dose result in albuminuria and haematuria. Furthermore, use over a long period may lead to pigmentation of the intestinal mucosa (pseudomelanosis coli), which usually recedes when the patient stops treatment (see section 4.1.2).
