In conclusion, tuberculosis in this age group is rare, severe, and difficult to diagnose. endometrial biopsy. Revisi\u00f3n de los lactantes menores de 3 meses con tuberculosis durante el periodo 1978-2014. Se diagnosticaron 8 casos (1,4% de las tuberculosis pedi\u00e1tricas): 3 tuberculosis cong\u00e9nitas, 3 sugestivas (biopsia endometrial no realizada) y 2 posnatales. La prueba de tuberculina fue negativa en 2 casos. La rentabilidad diagn\u00f3stica del cultivo (7/7, 100%) o PCR (3/3, 100%) de aspirado g\u00e1strico fue superior a la de la baciloscopia (5/8, 62%) y el test IGRA (1/3, 33%). Tres pacientes presentaron diseminaci\u00f3n miliar y uno falleci\u00f3. En conclusi\u00f3n, la tuberculosis en este grupo de edad es infrecuente, grave y de dif\u00edcil diagn\u00f3stico. En ausencia de contactos posnatales conocidos, se recomienda descartar tuberculosis genital materna mediante biopsia endometrial. In infants under the age of 3 months, tuberculosis (TB) may be caused by an TB is caused by airborne transmission from the or other adult infected with TB. The clinical manifestations and protocol are similar in both cases. [1](#bib0080) Its diagnosis is complicated as (IGRA) than in older children. [2](#bib0085) It is treated in the same way as infants over the age of 3 months, but there is very little pharmacological data to support the safety or efficacy of treatment below this age. [3](#bib0090) The risk of severe or disseminated infection is and mortality. [4](#bib0095) Despite its severity, there are very few series in the literature on TB in newborns and young infants. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, treatment and clinical of 3 months diagnosed with TB at our centre.Patients and methods The medical records of infants under the age of 3 months diagnosed with TB at the Hospital Universitario La Paz between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 2014 were reviewed. and microbiological to information about its clinical course and treatment. A tuberculosis diagnosis was positive patients diagnosed after year 2008. In each case, the QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In-Tube test (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) in accordance with CDC guidelines. [5,6](#bib0100) the following: in the first week life; or caseating hepatic tract; or exclusion of the of postnatal a thorough investigation of contacts. The computer programme Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, USA) was used for data collection and analysis.Results 555 cases of TB in children under the age of 14 years were diagnosed throughout the study period. Of these, 8 were in infants under the age of 3 months, representing 1.4% of all paediatric cases 63 36-87 days). Five were children of Moroccan immigrants and 3 were of Spanish descent. Just one patient was asymptomatic and was diagnosed by means of a contact investigation. No epidemiological history of TB at the onset of symptoms was found in the other cases. TB was not suspected as an initial diagnosis in any of the patients (3 lower respiratory tract infections, 3 sepsis, 1 pertussis). The time between symptom onset and diagnosis in these cases ranged from 2 to 6 weeks. Characteristics of infants under the age of 3 months later. The QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB Gold In-Tube test was performed in 3 cases, with 1 positive result and 2 inconclusive due to a lack of lymphocyte activation in the positive or mitogen control tube. Three cases were found positive PCR MTB in gastric juice or strain. Case 1 died from respiratory failure refractory to treatment in the first 24h of hospitalisation and the diagnosis was confirmed post-mortem. For the other 7 patients, median hospitalisation time was 33 days (interquartile range 17-132 by for 7 months in cases of pulmonary involvement only, and 10 months adult with TB was confirmed in 2 patients (cases 5 and 8). A further 3 infants (cases 1, 6 and 7) met the congenital TB criteria. In case 1, MTB was and liver samples obtained from the autopsy. After the death mother developed disseminated TB with meningeal PCR positive MTB). investigation. The mothers presented a positive TST with normal chest X-ray, and one of recurrent miscarriage. However, as an endometrial biopsy or an the placenta were performed, maternal genital TB could not be proven.Discussion TB is a rare, but potentially very serious, condition in infants under the age of 3 months. Its aggressive clinical course has been associated and infants with TB develop of infection is even common in untreated neonatal mortality and may afebrile. [1](#bib0080) considered in the differential diagnosis of infants the age of 3 months with sepsis or pneumonia with negative bacterial cultures high TB endemicity. Radiological abnormalities none patients had meningitis, this must always be ruled out as it has been reported in 11-22% of [9,10](#bib0120) In terms of diagnostic TST positive in out the reports rate. patients with an initial negative TST were later found to be positive with the same test, which highlights its diagnostic value and the need to repeat the test if tuberculosis is suspected. IGRA was performed in 3 cases, but aided diagnosis in just 1 patient. There is very little information in the literature concerning the effectiveness of these techniques in infants, but studies, on the other hand, is high. [14](#bib0145) Our series comprised 3 confirmed cases of congenital tuberculosis, 3 suspected cases and just 2 postnatal tuberculosis cases, despite the fact that TB acquired is considered to be more common. None of owing to the nonspecificity, of symptoms. this reason, an endometrial biopsy is recommended in newborns with TB presents a positive TST, normal chest X-ray and negative family history.
