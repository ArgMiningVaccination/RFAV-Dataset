Classic the vascular endothelium generating the normal multimers, which are the physiological active molecules leading to platelet is linked to genetic defects.

It is very important to insist that a timely diagnosis is mandatory in order to procede to a rapid therapeutic intervention (plasma exchange), which can be life-saving. In this respect, the examination of a well-stained peripheral blood slide by an experimented hematologist is requiring splenectomy in patients who do not has been described with a relapse-free survival rate of 70% at cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, eculizumab and N-acetylcysteine have been reported in some refractory cases as multiple first and second line therapies, with different responses.

ADAMTS-13 activity determination has been relevant in the study of TTP pathogenesis; however, it does not identify all patients who benefit from plasma exchange.

Significant advances have been made in the study of TTP; nevertheless, there is still much "}
