This study aimed to determine the severity at diagnosis, analyzing clinical and epidemiological features at debut in children under 16 years of age in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Material and methods A study was carried out in 7 hospitals of the public health network located in the south of our community. The severity at debut is compared with that of the two previous years (2018 and 2019). The level of statistical significance is set at p<0.05.Results In 2020, 61 patients debuted at the 7 hospital centres. The mean age was 10.1 years (SD: 2.6), The pH vs 7.30/7.30) excess of (11.9 vs 7.43/7.9) was lower than in previous had a positive history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Conclusions There has been an increase in the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes onset during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Las c\u00e9lulas \u00df-pancre\u00e1ticas son susceptibles a la infecci\u00f3n y replicaci\u00f3n de SARS-CoV-2, lo que podr\u00eda conducir a una diabetes relacionada con infecci\u00f3n o precipitar el debut de una diabetes tipo 1. El objetivo de este estudio ha sido determinar la gravedad al diagn\u00f3stico, analizando caracter\u00edsticas cl\u00ednicas y epidemiol\u00f3gicas en el contexto de la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2 en menores de 16 a\u00f1os.Material y m\u00e9todos Se lleva a cabo un estudio multic\u00e9ntrico observacional retrospectivo en7 hospitales de la red p\u00fablica de sanidad ubicados en el sur de nuestra comunidad. Se compara la gravedad al debut con la de los dos a\u00f1os previos (2018 y 2019). Se fija el nivel de significaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica en una p<0,05.Resultados En 2020 61 pacientes debutaron en los 7 centros hospitalarios. La edad media fue 10.1 a\u00f1os (DE: 2.6), 50.8% mayores de 10 a\u00f1os. La forma cl\u00ednica del debut fue cetoacidosis en el 52.5% frente al 39.5% y 26.5% en los dos a\u00f1os previos (p<0.01). El pH medio (7.24 vs 7.30/7.30) y exceso de bases (11.9 vs 7.43/7.9) fue menor que en los dos a\u00f1os anteriores y la hemoglobina glicada mayor (11.9 vs 11/10.6), p<0.05. Al menos el 10% de los pacientes ten\u00edan antecedentes positivos de infecci\u00f3n por SARS-CoV-2.Conclusiones Durante el primer a\u00f1o de pandemia COVID-19ha habido un aumento en la frecuencia de cetoacidosis diab\u00e9tica como forma de debut. Type 1 diabetes and replication have been published, [2](#bib0010) which could lead to infection-related diabetes according to the onset of [3](#bib0015) is especially prevalent in the population, particularly age. [4](#bib0020) Global incidence rates vary widely from country to country range between 15% and 80% for newly-diagnosed T1DM. [5](#bib0025) In Spain, data published to date show a frequency of 40% of newly-diagnosed patients under 15 years of age. [6](#bib0030) In Germany and Italy [7](#bib0035) an increased incidence of in children the onset of T1DM has been reported. [8](#bib0040) Some publications in Spain suggest the same findings. Some of the hypotheses proposed the relationship strict lockdown imposed in the first few months of the pandemic, the fear of the population going to medical centres, or the role the infection itself could have in acting as an accelerator or trigger. [10,11](#bib0050) This study aimed to determine the clinical severity of patients under 16 years of age at the onset of diabetes against the backdrop of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to compare this with the two previous years as any possible with COVID-19 A of patients years of age 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic. Severity at onset was compared with the two previous years (2018 and 2019). Seven public hospitals located in the south of the Community of Madrid took part: Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada, Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa (Legan\u00e9s), Hospital Universitario de M\u00f3stoles, Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos (M\u00f3stoles), Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Hospital Universitario del Tajo (Aranjuez) and Hospital Universitario Infanta Cristina (Parla). The first case of COVID-19 in Spain was reported on 31 January 2020 and in the Community of Madrid on 25 February 2020. Inclusion criteria - - Being under 16 years of age at the onset of T1DM. - - Living in the catchment area of the participating sites in the 3 months before onset. - of infection and/or IgG and IgM were analysed admission. The criteria for the Three age groups were established: 04 years, 59 years and 1015 years. The software EPIDAT 4.0. was used. Quantitative variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation. If the variable does not fit a normal distribution, it is expressed as the median and exact test when required. The level of statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. The study was approved by the Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada Independent Ethics Committee and seconded by the Principal Investigator.Results In 2020, 61 patients were diagnosed with T1DM at the seven hospitals. Some 24.6% of the patients came from a single centre. The mean age was 10.1 years (SD: 2.6; IQR: 7.2-13.5). Regarding group, 36.1% of 0-4 years, 13.1% 5-9 years and 50.8% >10 years. In total, 54.1% of the study population were female. Overall, 75.4% were of Spanish origin, 11.5% from North Africa, 6.5% from Eastern Europe and one patient was from Latin America. Some 31.1% of cases occurred in the third quarter of the year and 24.6% in the first ( [Fig. 1](#fig0005)). In 2018 and 2019, data were collected from 43 and 34 patients, respectively, with a mean age of 8.7 years (SD: 3.9) and 8.8 years (SD: 3.8), which was lower than the mean age recorded in 2020 (p<0.05). In total, and 79.4%, respectively, were of Spanish was of patients reported a time since onset of 2 weeks admission unit (PICU), with no significant differences in between the different age the in infusion, the mean was for >24h in 9.8% of patients. In 2018 and 2019, the most common symptom was polyuria, reported onset was 2 weeks or less in 45.2% and 55% of cases. [Table 3](#tbl0015) details the symptoms and time pH at diagnosis was lower than in the previous years (p<0.01), positive in all cases except one, in which they were not measured. Around 10% of patients (6/61) also incidence of COVID-19 in the Community of Madrid superimposed. In total, the onset of 85.2% (n=52) of patients diagnosed in 2020 was after the first reported case of COVID-19 in the Community of Madrid. An RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in 40 patients upon admission, which was positive in three cases. Of those patients with negative RT-PCR, one had positive IgG serology, and in another case, both parents were infected at the time. Therefore, five patients (9.6%) had a positive history.Discussion 2020 saw increase in the severity of the onset of T1DM in children under 16 years of age (higher frequency of ketoacidosis, countries. [13,14](#bib0065) Although the association with lockdown and the fear of going to medical centres has been one of the hypotheses proposed to explain this8 the time since onset of symptoms was <2 weeks in slightly more than 50% of cases, with no differences compared to the previous years, suggesting that there was no delay in receiving health care, which leads us to believe that there must be other factors involved in this greater severity at onset. Moreover, been found presenting with or of healthcare the Autonomous Community was partial closure of primary care during the first months of the pandemic to support the care of patients with COVID-19 at the Hospital de Emergencias Enfermera Zendal, as well as the subsequent restriction of face-to-face telephone found, tendency in our study towards lower C-peptide values in 2020 to years (0.62 vs 0.78/0.8) (ng/mL), a finding that goes in higher incidence of ketoacidosis [17](#bib0085) and insulin production. During the months of March, April and May (21 March to 6 May), emergency paediatric care was redistributed to two main hospitals in the Community of Madrid. However, some patients continued to go to their nearest referral hospital. More cases in our population were recorded in 2020 than in 2018 or 2019. Patient displacement to other hospitals could be one of the reasons why the mean age of our patients was greater in 2020 than in the two previous years (10.1 years versus 8.7 and 8.8 years; p<0.05) 9 even though other series have recorded age at diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. [18](#bib0090) Children under five years of age are the most susceptible to ketoacidosis and the most likely to require intensive care, which was confirmed by our data (75% ketoacidosis). However, no significant differences were found due to the small sample size. Data from the literature regarding SARS-CoV-2-precipitated T1DM in children and adolescents are contradictory. [7,19,20](#bib0035) In our series, of the 40 patients with onset during the COVID-19 pandemic and who underwent some kind of diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, up to 12.5% of cases were in some way associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In December 2020, the overall prevalence in Spain adolescents small sample and specific geographical area, we believe these data should be analysed as part of the national figures to confirm this result. Contrary to this finding, no parallelism between the COVID-19 incidence the severity of T1DM cases in patients with a history of infection. Owing to the small number of cases, this could not be evaluated in our study. The limitations of this paper are those characteristic of a retrospective study, namely lost and/or missing data. The time since the onset of initial symptoms is not very precise due to the subjective and retrospective nature of the data collection. It is also impossible to confirm whether these symptoms may have been attributed to lockdown, or even been detected earlier due to stricter control. Even so, given that most of the variables analysed are biochemical parameters, interpretation and selection bias of new-onset T1DM as some diagnosed cases will have been seen at other centres, meaning that these data are not real and may underestimate the actual incidence.Conclusions In 2020, 52.5% of patients increase in severity. Between 10% and of patients had a positive history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A national registry of newly-diagnosed T1DM cases, their severity and their possible association with SARS-CoV-2 infection are just one of the measures that need to be implemented as part of the ketoacidosis prevention policies.Conflicts of interest The authors "}
