Thus, rich sources identified, which can be explored and used for the food and pharmaceutical industry. The growing interest in the development of the food and pharmaceutical industry today, in improving and preserving health, has awakened for the greater use of natural resources of plant origin that can be incorporated as new products in benefits, as well as necessary nutrients with the from natural extracts from various parts of In this report, the relevant obteined during the development of and efficient technologies bioactive extracts from this plant and to determine its bioactivity. In this doctoral thesis we have angolense plant from Angola, from flowers, obtained by extraction by pressurized liquids (PLE) as results achieved showed that the extracts obtained from roots and with w\u00e1ter, when used as a solvent for of phenolic compouds. The of 50\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C of both matrices. In addition, the visaulization of the protein profile in these polar extracts was observed with more frequent bands of proteins of large molecular weight (97 KDa) and of chemical composition according to the nature of each matrix, being for mainly total phenolic acids On the the cochlospermun genus, presented varied in the concentra tion in the root extracts with 91% and 52%. evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the natural extracts of roots and flowers of the borututu plant showed high antioxidant capacity, attributed to phenolic content according to variations depending on the chemical nature when it comes to the root or flower matrix. In addition, the flower for obtained with the solvent etanol and ethyl acetate showed a good response to the antibacterial activity against the gran negative bacteria Eschrerichia coli, with greater effectiveness for the flower extracts. In general, the results observed in a research study suggest that the parts of this plant, such as roots and flowers; that can be used as suppplements or ingredients for the food and pharmaceutical industry.
