We are also functioning as a organic and regenerative farm, taking care of more than 3 hectares of food forrest and gardens, with exotic fruit trees from all around the world, we are in the beginning stages of stewarding 10 hectares of land in total here with the intention to expand and continue to create more infrastructure to be able to host more people, with the intention to attract people that feel called to the mission and vision and would like to support. We are looking for people who are attracted to living a simple and deepen spiritual practice KARMA YOGA and SPIRITUAL PRACTICE: Here we are aiming to strive towards the highest way of living and are creating a container where we have scheduled times for our spiritual practice and meditations, for our karma yoga, and our free time. The farm is a place to cultivate stillness through practice of yoga's eight limbs and meditation, a place for detoxing on a mental, emotional and physical and therefore we are looking for the right people to come and that would like to join us for our daily meditation and practices DETOX AND HEALING: Our intention is offer detox, and silent retreats on the farm, where it's important for those who would like to come and stay at the farm have interest in healing arts, meditations and living sustainably with nature and the community. We offer programs in detoxing the body mind Our is from december to May and the rainy season from June to November. There can be a lot of bugs, insects and lots of rain in the rainy season and therefore we suggest to to be prepared with any essential gears. OUR CREW: At the moment we are 2 persons(Jacob 32 years of age and Isha 31 years of age) on the farm with 3 dogs and a cat and local workers. FARM: We have 3 hectares of fruit trees planted out on the land, the farm is nestled in a quiet area of the Diamond valley, ideal for people who like to be in nature and in quietness, there are rivers close by. We are looking to grow more trees and establish more food forests and help with the reforestation on the land so there can be more biodiversity on the farm and in the surrounding area. FOOD/DIET: Around 60% of the food in the dry season is coming from the farm and eventually we hope to become self sufficient in food source that also can be provided to the our community. Our diet is vibrant as a lot is coming from local organic farmers and from our farm. We have also establised ourselves in plantbased diet and raw food and encourage those that come to feel out this way of living and thriving. Our kitchen is 100% plantbased and we do not provide any animal sources nor it's allowed to bring meat, dairy to the kitchen. We are striving to be living and eating from the farm, as of now we are able to provide a large portion of our food from the farm and gardens such as fruits, greens, yucca, beans, sweet potatoes. Envisioned as an INTERGRATION AND MEDITATION CENTER: As a newly born project with the vision of having people coming to heal and practice healing arts, therefore we ask to not bring habits, subtances, alcohol, smokes, meat/dairy to the farm. We are encouraging people to let go of habit patterns and to live free of conditions, cultivate love and awareness during the stay. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Please only make a request if this resonates with you.
