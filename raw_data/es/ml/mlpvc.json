Acupuncture has its origin in China and in other Asian countries such as Japan, Korea or Vietnam.

Everything can be related to Yin and Yang, Heat and Cold, Excess and Void, internal and external, day and night, winter and summer, woman and man, etc. TCM and Acupuncture try to balance these poles, in the balance is the origin of health.
