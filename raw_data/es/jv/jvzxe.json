For a PDF version of this factsheet, click PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a class of chemicals that manufacturers add to a wide variety of consumer products to make them non-stick, waterproof, and stain-resistant. There PFAS because of health effects including high cholesterol and cancers, even at low levels of exposure. There is also growing evidence that PFAS can affect the immune system by suppressing the ability of the immune system to make antibodies critical to fighting infectious diseases. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the many risks facing water or other sources, may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Studies in the Faroe Islands found children with higher blood levels of PFAS had lower levels of two after receiving their DTaP vaccination at age five (Grandjean 2012). Study of US children ages 12 to 19 found those with higher levels of PFOS also had as mumps (Stein 2016). In Norway, researchers found that children at age three, whose mothers had higher blood levels of PFAS at the time of their birth, experienced more colds and episodes of gastroenteritis. The children also had of antibodies to rubella studies have on the childhood vaccinations through adolescence suggesting a possible link between PFAS and asthma in children (Dong 2013, Averina 2019). New research in animals continues to strengthen the link between PFAS and the immune system and more studies are underway, such as the Multi-site Health Study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). What is the state of the science? PFOS and PFOA\u2014two of the most common PFAS\u2014are each \"presumed to be an immune hazard to humans.\" That was the conclusion of a 2016 report by the National Toxicology Program (NTP 2016). The federal body reviewed 153 studies in humans, animals, and other laboratory experiments, and found evidence linking exposures with a range of immune system effects. stronger are important for warding off viruses and cancer cells Children may be especially sensitive to the effects of PFAS because their immune systems are still developing. In a 2017 review by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), scientists looked at 64 studies found links between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to PFAS that exposures to these make populations more vulnerable to infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, reduce vaccinations. Additionally, changes to the life could affect health later in life. Given the evidence, leading experts say current drinking water guidelines are not adequately protective, often therefore more research is needed to better understand the health of effects of these complex mixtures.
