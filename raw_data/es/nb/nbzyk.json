Food production and sales are and will be growing as the population grows. Production of reasonable and quality organic products is a problem which becomes more relevant day after day. Small and mediumscale farmers are the producers of local natural food. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), the world counts with over 500 million farmers. The most of them are small producers. However, the traditional business models which exist today led the major food brands and agricultural corporations to push the small and medium-scale producers and processors of agricultural products and foodstuffs out from the local markets. The globalization mechanisms help them to tighten their domination easily, using their own material and immaterial on the markets of countries with less developed economies. Long chains of agricultural products used by transnational corporations, have led to a decline in the consumption of local products. That has led, in its turn, to a reduction of the number of small and mediumscale farms (data from the United States and Europe), increase of the average age of farmers (over 58 years), thus lowering the competitiveness, and into the market of large corporations and intermediaries. Therefore, as an example, even in the United States a farmer gets only 16 cents for every dollar paid by the final buyer for the products he has produced. 2 billion of people on Earth (mostly rural population) do not have any access to the banking services and are excluded from the modern economic processes. We do not set ourselves the task to strive against the transnational corporations, and we don't oppose globalization. We believe that these are all attributes of the current moment of the development of our civilization. Any form of confrontation leads inevitably to the destruction and losses. But we cannot ignore the economic, social and humanitarian expenses of the existing models. So, our platform will be put up to provide an equal access to a global market of production and distribution of consumable goods for the large and small producers and consumers of agricultural products and foodstuffs together with the modern financial instruments.

That really depends. While Foodcoin does not show any signal of scam or of being a clearly bad investment, it will only be a very good investment for their target audience, so you should be aware of that. You should note that only consumers of natural food or companies that sell them will be the perfect targets for the ICO. This is somewhat of a limited group, so if you are not sure that you will fit this criteria, there might be other investments that will be more recommended for an investor like you. There is no guarantee that this company will be very successful, but their previous experience with 1000 EcoFarms seems like a positive point, so they might actually have a good degree of success in their next years in the market.
