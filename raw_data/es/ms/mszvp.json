But scarring and hardening of the vein blocks blood flow, and prevents the liver from doing its job removing excess salt from the body.

TIPS could help Paul. First, his care team needed to stop fluid buildup, so Paul could get healthy enough to have TIPS procedure. Paul needed paracentesis: A needle is to off the fluid. NH+C's Endoscopy team does this procedure in the Surgery Center at Northfield Hospital. But first, Paul had to stop drinking. Surgeon Ashley Marek, MD convinced him. \"She said, 'This is what you what you need to do. And we'll get through it together.' She was instrumental in saving my life.\" \"She's a rock star,\" Paul says. she's doing, and very reassuring.\" Paul had paracentesis every week for a year. The Endoscopy team drained about 17 pounds of fluid from his body every week. \"I'd go was \"very encouraging and helpful. They made it a lot easier in a bad situation,\" Paul says.

He had the TIPS procedure at the University of Minnesota, and has I couldn't have done it without those gals. Dr. Marek and Stephanie were my and yoga five times a week.

(Urgent Care is triage-based care. Patients are seen based on urgency of symptoms, not in order of arrival.) \"The nurse was efficient and super friendly with Davis - she had good rapport with a 4-year-old who didn't want to the situation and past experiences to get up to speed on his medical history,\" Erin says. \"I was impressed by the level of questions she asked. And she was willing to answer all the questions we had, even things not related to the main reason we came in,\" like that little cough Davis had. A physical exam and a quick lab test gave Erin the answers she wanted. Davis got a sticker, then some ice cream at home, and got on with his day feeling fine about his detour to the clinic. \"It was such a relief to have answers, to be able to take care of it so easily, and get back to our weekend,\" Erin says. Follow up was smooth, too - in both directions: \"They made it clear that they'd follow up with full lab results, and also made me comfortable that we could call or come in on Monday if Davis wasn't feeling better by then.\" (He was.) \"It's so great to have an option when your primary clinic isn't open,\" Erin says. \"For things that don't - an ear infection, or strep throat - it's great to be able to get test results and treatment and move on with your day.\" Urgent Care is a much option for \"It's not helpful to says. \"I don't want to be sitting in the ED when someone who really needs that level of help comes in.\" Erin's advice about Urgent Care: \"If you need it, use it.

Family medicine physician David McIntyre, MD suggests 11 key questions: 1How are my blood pressure and heart rate? \"The nurse will take your vitals while rooming you. Ask then: 'Are they within normal range? Do we need to talk about them if they're not?'\" 2What's a good target for my weight? \"Ask your provider if you're at a good weight for your height, age, medical conditions, and other factors. Would you benefit from dropping or gaining a few pounds, or maybe more?\" 3 Are my medications and doses right for me? \"It's useful to review all your medications at the same time to prevent interactions and monitor side effects. You want your primary care provider to have a full picture of all your medications - especially if some prescriptions are from other doctors, specialists who focus on one aspect of your medical care.\" 4 Are these over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements OK for me? \"Bring one Vitamin C pill is helpful but taking 10 may be harmful.

And, substances advertised as 'miracle cures' can actually be harmful.\" 5 Am I up to date on all my immunizations? \"Children's appointments tetanus every 10 years, shingles vaccine starting at age 50, pneumonia vaccine starting at age 65, and of course COVID vaccination for everyone medically eligible. If you have record your immunizations, bring it in.

There are exceptions based on family history and your health history - it may be right to start younger, or screen more frequently. Ask about it.\" 7 What lab tests do I need, and what information do they give you? \"Routine lab work, like cholesterol and diabetes screening, shows your doctor any areas of concern so we can treat it early. We treat high cholesterol to lower your risk of heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular disease. With diabetes, we want to manage it early to prevent damage to your eyes, kidneys, nervous system.

If it's not easily visible, point it out.\" 9 Here's what's new in my family history. \"If your dad has had a heart attack, or your sister was diagnosed with breast cancer since your last checkup, tell us. That might adjust when and how we screen your health. Conditions with strong hereditary links include breast and colon cancer, Type 2 diabetes, and vascular disease (heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure).

For habits that you know that aren't good for your health (like smoking), ask for help on how to stop.\" 11 Can we talk about anxiety and depression? \"Yes, we can - and should. Stress, insomnia, anxiety, depression are the things that people shy to bring up, but they're often what leads to other health conditions and chemical use.

Tambi\u00e9n es un buen momento para informarse sobre los pasos que hay que dar ahora y en el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o.

Pregunte: \u00bfAlguna preocupaci\u00f3n por estas sustancias? \u00bfAcerca de las cantidades? Tomar una pastilla de vitamina C es \u00fatil, pero tomar 10 puede ser perjudicial. En la mayor\u00eda de los casos, menos es mejor. Adem\u00e1s, algunas sustancias que se anuncian como 'curas milagrosas' pueden ser realmente perjudiciales\". 5 \u00bfEstoy al d\u00eda con todas mis vacunas? \"Las citas de los ni\u00f1os se centran bastante en las vacunas; los adultos tambi\u00e9n deben preguntar por las vacunas adecuadas a su edad.

Si se siente ansioso todo el tiempo o se siente retra\u00eddo, h\u00e1blelo. Su proveedor puede ayudar a facilitar la asesor\u00eda o la terapia; otras opciones son los grupos de apoyo, los cambios en la dieta y el ejercicio, y los medicamentos.

We give them the freshest, best product we can, to nurture their health. It's food with purpose.\" Hospitals get a bad rap for their food. Big hospitals manage high volumes by limiting order from a fairly wide menu, at any time they choose, and the meal is made to order, with fresh (never frozen) ingredients. \"One patient said we serve the best meatloaf they've ever had, and they'd come back to the hospital just for that,\" says Ashley Mendel, director of Culinary Services at Northfield Hospital. Produce is delivered five time a week for the freshest ingredients. \"We choose produce that's in season, and we at in ingredients, flavors, and styles of cooking\" to and Molly says. It's all cooked from scratch, and assem- bled to order. Ashley and Molly are both graduates of Le Cordon Bleu; Molly holds degrees in Dietetics cooked healthcare and event sites across the Twin Cities (including her own ballroom). Ashley was a chef for the Minnesota Vikings, feeding players, stadium staff and VIP visitors every game day. Ashley and Molly both connected food to health early in their lives. \"My dad had cancer, and that's when I got into foods, cooking for him,\" Ashley says. \"He always joked when I was in culinary school that he was throwing up from chemo, not from my food. But we knew it was 50/50,\" she laughs. Molly was young when her mom had heart surgery, and grew tired of all the hot dish that her mom's recovery. didn't like it,\" Molly recalls.
