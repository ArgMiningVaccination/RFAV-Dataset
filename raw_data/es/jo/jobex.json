Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 4 That thine [aalms](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note4a) may be in secret: and secret himself thee openly. 5 \u00b6 And when thou shalt not be as the [ahypocrites](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note5a) are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy [acloset](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note6a), and when thou hast [bshut](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note6b) thy door, [cpray](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note6c) to thy Father which is in [dsecret](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note6d); and thy Father which [eseeth](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note6e) in secret shall [freward](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note6f) [arepetitions](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note7a), as the [bheathen](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note7b) do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father [aknoweth](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note8a) what things ye have [bneed](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note8b) of, before manner [bpray](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note9b) ye: [cFather](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note9c) which heaven, thy [ename](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note9e). 10 Thy [akingdom](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note10a) come. Thy [bwill be](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note10b) done [cin earth](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note10c), as it is in heaven. 11 Give us this day our daily [abread](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note11a). 12 And forgive us our [adebts](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note12a), as we [bforgive](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note12b) deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the [eglory](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note13e), for ever. Amen. 14 For if ye [aforgive](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note14a) trespasses, your heavenly ye not will your trespasses. 16 \u00b6 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to [afast](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note16a). Verily I say unto you, They [bhave](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note16b) their reward. 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 18 That thou appear not unto men to [afast](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note18a), but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall [breward](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note18b) openly. 19 \u00b6 thieves up heaven, neither moth nor rust doth and where thieves do not break through nor [bsteal](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note20b): 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine [aeye](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note22a) be [bsingle](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note22b), thy whole body shall be full of [clight](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note22c). 23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that [adarkness](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note23a)! 24 \u00b6 [aNo](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note24a) man can [bserve](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note24b) two [cmasters](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note24c): for either he will [dhate](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note24d) the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and [emammon](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note24e). 25 [aTherefore](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note25a) I say unto you, Take no [bthought](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note25b) for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? 26 Behold the fowls of the air: not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? 27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 28 why take ye thought for raiment? [aConsider](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note28a) the lilies of the field, they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [ashall](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note30a) he not much more clothe you, O ye of little [bfaith](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note30b)? 31 Therefore take thought, or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father [aknoweth](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note32a) that ye have need of all these things. 33 [aBut](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note33a) [bseek](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note33b) ye first the [ckingdom](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note33c) of God, and his [drighteousness](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note33d); and all these [ethings](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note33e) shall be [fadded](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note33f) unto you. 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take [athought](/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=9-16#note34a) for the things of itself.
