A age, gender, antibody status, and ABW.Results A total of 882 charts of patients were reviewed. 586 patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 55 years. There was no correlation between the LT4 dose and age.

Age and menopause did not influence the required daily dose of LT4. Existe un concepto de que la dosis de levotiroxina (LT4) tiende a disminuir con la edad. Sin embargo, hay controversia al respecto. Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar si la dosis de LT4 requerida para alcanzar el estado eutiroideo var\u00eda seg\u00fan la edad, el peso corporal, el sexo, el estado de la menopausia y el estado de los anticuerpos.Materiales y m\u00e9todos Se realiz\u00f3 un estudio transversal a partir de la revisi\u00f3n retrospectiva de historias cl\u00ednicas de pacientes con diagn\u00f3stico previo de hipotiroidismo primario en el tratamiento con LT4 y en estado eutiroideo. Se registraron sexo, edad, peso corporal actual (PCA), TSH y dosis de LT4. El estado eutiroideo se defini\u00f3 como una TSH s\u00e9rica dentro del rango de 0,4-4 UI/mL. Se realiz\u00f3 un modelo de regresi\u00f3n lineal m\u00faltiple para evaluar la dosis de LT4 y la edad, el sexo, el estado de los anticuerpos y el PCA.Resultados Se revisaron un total de 882 cuadros de pacientes. Quinientos ochenta y seis pacientes cumplieron los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n. La mediana de edad fue de 55 a\u00f1os. No hubo correlaci\u00f3n entre la dosis de LT4 y la edad. Se observ\u00f3 una correlaci\u00f3n positiva entre la dosis de LT4 y el PCA, pero no con el PC ideal. El an\u00e1lisis de regresi\u00f3n lineal demostr\u00f3 que los anticuerpos positivos y el PCA tienen un efecto significativo sobre la dosis de LT4. La comparaci\u00f3n de la dosis de LT4 entre los diferentes grupos de edad no arroj\u00f3 diferencias.Conclusi\u00f3n Nuestro estudio demuestra que la dosis de LT4 necesaria para lograr el eutiroidismo est\u00e1 influenciada por el PCA y la presencia de anticuerpos. La edad y la menopausia no influyeron en la dosis diaria requerida de LT4. Hypothyroidism is a common of hypothyroidism is higher in older age groups, starting at about 60 years of age, or at least that hypothyroidism is being treated more frequently in older age group. [3](#bib0095) It is now well established that while tetraiodothyronine (T4) is the major secretory the thyroid gland, thyroid hormone action the effects of triiodothyronin (T3) binding to its nuclear receptor, defining T4 as a pro-hormone for T3. Levothyroxine (LT4) has been considered the standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism for many years, and is recommended as the preparation of choice due to its efficacy in resolving the symptoms of hypothyroidism, long-term experience of administration, good intestinal absorption, long Two studies have shown that ideal is a surrogate marker of euthyroidism. It is assumed to be an integrated measure of how the individual axis is desirable functional concept that LT4 replacement dose tend to decrease with age, but this could be influenced by actual body weight, lean body weight, sex, or menopausal state. [11,12](#bib0135) However, there is controversy in the and cross-sectional study was performed from the retrospective review of charts of adult patients over 18 years of age from four Endocrinology services in the cities of Rosario and Casilda (Argentina) during the period of time between January 2017 and December Approval from the study hypothyroidism in treatment with non-thyroidectomized, state and with a stable dose of LT4 during the last six months were central hypothyroidism, follow-up and/or irregular treatment were under treatment amiodarone, age, actual body weight (ABW) (kg), height (cm), body mass index (BMI), LT4 in 2.5cm. The degree of the period, it decided determination with the range of 0.4-4IU/ml. The age 18-44 years, 45-65 years and over 65 years.Statistical analysis Statistical software R version 3.6.3 was used. The normality of continuous variables was determined using homogeneity the variances using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney for the comparison of two groups and Kruskal-Wallis, post hoc Holm, for the comparison of more than two groups) and the as median regression daily Differences were considered significant if p<0.05.Results A total of 882 charts of patients were reviewed. Of this total, 586 patients (533 women and 53 men) met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 55 years (41-67). Of the 533 women, 228 were of reproductive age and 305 were post-menopausal. The status of TPOAb and/or TgAb of overweight and age (rho=0.182, p=0.014). There was no correlation between daily dose of LT4 (g/day) and age (rho=0.016, p=0.69) in the overall analysis of the patients, but a negative correlation was observed between the daily dose of LT4 a function of ABW or IBW, correlation analysis status, of the presence of positive LT4 as ABW (g/kg/day) between the differences ( [Fig. 3](#fig0015)). of LT4 as ABW compared according to the state of the it thyroiditis it was the of compared to patients between 45 years and over 65 years ( [Fig. 4](#fig0020)). LT4 has been considered the standard of care for the treatment of hypothyroidism for many years. This treatment is efficacious when administered orally, has a long serum half-life that permits daily administration, and results in resolution of the signs relationship between the total daily dose of LT4 and body composition by dose and total BW. the association was much stronger when the LT4 dose was correlated with lean body mass than with fat mass, both measured by dual having the highest impact. been suggested that mass or alterations in body composition and/or changes associated with menopause are with lower LT4 requirement associated with age. [9,10,13,14](#bib0125) However, in our study it was observed that the daily dose of LT4 necessary to achieve euthyroidism does not change according to age. However, regarding to the effect of age on LT4 requirement, analyses have not always incorporated adjustments for both the BW and sex of patients. One to achieve the euthyroid state is related to the presence of antibodies and ABW, but is not influenced by age, sex, or menopausal status. Furthermore, we did not find differences in the LT4 expressed as function of ABW or menopausal). This contrasts with several studies that show a lower requirement in postmenopausal women and men [11,12](#bib0135) and agrees with reports that show that age does 1.03g/kg/day). This is in line a previous study that shown a higher a higher dose, with between patients 44 and 65 years and older than 65 years. The limitations of our study are based on its retrospective nature. This type of design does not allow us to define the presence of symptoms compatible with hypothyroidism independently of a TSH within the normal range, to control the LT4 intake time or to use a centralized laboratory for all determinations. Furthermore, we considered the euthyroid state only according TSH level and did not include peripheral hormones (free T4, total T4, and T3) in the analysis. Recently, Lac\u00e1mara et al. described that of T4 to T3 and an increase rT3, with out this included patients with normal TSH levels. Another limitation is the use of a mathematical formula to estimate the IBW and, consequently, the lean of achieve this comparison is not part of the objectives of the present study, and future analyzes are required to corroborate this finding. Our by BW and the presence of antibodies. Only in the subgroup "}
