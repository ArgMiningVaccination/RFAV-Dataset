The investigation is focused the development of monitors based on the EEG , once it physiological signal to assess the depth of anesthesia in dogs, in clinical The main objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the human Cerebral State Index (CSI ) during anesthesia with propofol in dogs. This monitor uses EEG as the input variable, which is analysed with fuzzy logic to process data. The f uzzy logic analysis is a problem -solving control system methodology that incorporates a simple, ruled -based\" IF X and Y then a control problem his mathematical algorithm used in monitors used in better performance in quantifying depth of anesthe sia in dogs. The the Burst suppression ratio ( BSr) whic h is defined as the percentage of time in 30 -s window where the amplitude of the electroencephalographic signal was less All studies were performed at Porto Veterinary Hospital. All dogs came from an adoption program established between local animal shelters and the Porto Hospital. The studies were evaluating the CSM . pharmacokinetic model for propofol was incorporated in Ruggloop \u00ae software , which was used to drive the propofol infusion. This was done according to the desired the concentration achieved by three electrodes placed in speci in the head thereafter EEG signal is converted by the Cerebral State Monitor into the CSI . In the first phase (chapter 3.1) , the performance of the CSM monitor evaluated after the administration of a propofol concentrations in the dogs were detected by the cerebral state index ( CSI), displayed by the CSM . The next step to evaluate the CSI is to find the accuracy of the monitor when correlated with clinical endpoints. In the second phase (chapter 3.2) it was introduced the clinical end points, ocular reflexes position of the eyeball to evaluate the performance of the CSM monitor in dogs during inductio n of anesthesia with propofol. F ive anesthetic , classified from A to E, were proposed based ocular on reflexes and position of the eyeball. During induction of anesthesia at 200mlh-1 it was o high correlation consistent with the clinical observations on the third phase of the study (Chapter 3.3), the CSI and the It was observed a good correlation between Pro pCp and the anesthetic planes . Despite of a better correlation between CSI, anesthetic planes detect deep of anesthesia when BSR occurs. These findings could compromise the use CSM showed important esthetic anesthesia , which may be of relevance when considering of future Fuzzy logic based EEG monitors . 8 Resumen. En los \u00faltimos 20 -30 a\u00f1os, los avances en la tecnolog\u00eda inform\u00e1tica permiten la utilizaci\u00f3n de complejas t\u00e9cnicas de modelizaci\u00f3n estad\u00edstica del electroencefalograma (EEG) co n el fin de generar una escala num\u00e9rica \"\u00edndice\" para evaluar la profundidad anest\u00e9sica y ayudar a los m\u00e9dicos anestesistas humanos. Nuestro objetivo en esta memoria de tesis doctoral es el desarrollo de un \u00edndice basado en los patrones del electroencefalo grama producidos por alteraciones en el fisiolog\u00eda cerebral cuando el animal esta anestesiado, y relacionarlos con la profundidad anest\u00e9sica. Es decir la utilizaci\u00f3n del encefalograma para evaluar la profundidad anest\u00e9sica, ya que hasta ahora ninguno de lo s signos cl\u00ednicos que utilizamos puede, de forma cuantitativa, relacionarse con la profundidad anest\u00e9sica. En este trabajo realizamos la anestesia general con propofol en perros sanos a los que se les somete a una cirug\u00eda de orquitectom\u00eda, y que provienen de sociedades protectoras que tienen convenios con el Hospital Veterinario de Oporto (Portugal). Se emplea el Electroencefalograma como variable de entrada, que es analizada con l\u00f3gica difusa para procesar los datos. El algoritmo matem\u00e1tico que utiliza est e equipo, parece ser que es el m\u00e1s adecuado para intentar obtener los \u00edndices que nos midan la profundidad anest\u00e9sica. En todos los estudios del trabajo de tesis doctoral, se incorpor\u00f3 el modelo farmacocin\u00e9tico del propofol desarrollado por Beths, T y col . 2001, mediante el Ruggloop software, que nos proporciona la estimaci\u00f3n de la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de propofol en sangre. Con el fin de evaluar el rendimiento del \"Cerebral State Monitor\", a parato que detecta el efecto de los anest\u00e9sicos sobre el cere bro, recogiendo y procesando la actividad el\u00e9ctrica cerebral, y convirtiendo esta se\u00f1al el\u00e9ctrica, a trav\u00e9s de algoritmos matem\u00e1ticos, en un \u00edndice reconocible, se realiz\u00f3 el estudio en tres fases: 1\u00aa fase. - Se administr\u00f3 un bolo de propofol de 6 mg. /Kgpv . Los cambios de la actividad el\u00e9ctrica cerebral fueron cuantificados mediante el c\u00e1lculo del \u00edndice de estado cerebral. (Artic ulo \"Brain monitoring in dogs using the cerebral state index Turing the induction of anesthesia via target -controlled infusi\u00f3n o f propofol\"). 2\u00aa fase. Se administro propofol en infusi\u00f3n constante de 200 ml/hora en concentraci\u00f3n del 1%. En este trabajo se introdujeron los signos cl\u00ednicos, reflejos oculares, posici\u00f3n del globo ocular, etc. con el fin de observar la correlaci\u00f3n entre las 9 concentraciones plasm\u00e1ticas estimadas de propofol y los signos cl\u00ednicos observados durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia. Sin embargo el rendimiento del \"Cerebral State Monitor\", no se corresponde con las observaciones cl\u00ednicas en los diferentes planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica. (Arti culo \"Correlation between clinical signs of depth of anesthesia and cerebral state index responses in dogs during induction of anesthesia with propofol\"). 3\u00aa fase. - Se eval\u00faa el \"\u00cdndice de Estado cerebral\" (CSI) medido por el \"Cerebral State Monitor\" (CSM) en perros anestesiados con diferentes concentraciones de propofol. Se demostr\u00f3 que a pesar de que hay una mayor correlaci\u00f3n entre el CSI y los planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica, no siempre se pod\u00edan distinguir unos planos anest\u00e9sicos de otros. (Articulo \"Correlation between clinical signs of depth of anesthesia and cerebral state index responses in dog with different target -controlled infusions of propofol\"). En conclusi\u00f3n la utilizaci\u00f3n de monitores de profundidad anest\u00e9si ca puede guiarnos en la dosificaci\u00f3n de anest\u00e9sicos, evitando la sobre dosificaci\u00f3n y reduciendo costes y efectos secundarios, pero el CSM mostr\u00f3 limitaciones cl\u00ednicas importantes durante la evaluaci\u00f3n de la inducci\u00f3n y mantenimiento de la anestesia en procedimientos rutinarios de anestesia en perros, aunque si permite detectar alertas en planos profundos de anestesia. 10 Index Agradecimentos the depth of anesthesia? ............................ 32 the ................................ ................................ ......... 34 1.3.1 - - Artifact within the brain ................................ ................................ assess ................................ ................ 69 de memoria ............. 92 2.3.

In an attempt to te understanding the role played monitors of this first chapter addresses the main issues regarding the use of that tool in common v eterinary practice. During this discussion special attention is devot ed to the dog the target specie from this thesis. 1.1-Depth of anesthesia: What have we been monitoring? 1.1.1 -History The dogs had a great value in development of intravenous anesthesia . In 1657 , Sir Christopher Wren the famous arch itect, carried out the first experiments at Duc de Bordeux `s house . Wren ligated the veins of a large dog, made an opening on the side of the ligature toward the heart and introduce d the syringe in this opening. The syringe was made off animal bladder , to which a quill had been attached , and filled with a opium solution in one case and crocus metallorum in stupefied \" (probably a deep sedation) but did not kill the dog. Sir Wren was certainly unconscious of his (First Lieut Keys 1942) (Refer ence Librarian, Mayo clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, reviewed by War Manuscript Board) . The classical concept of anesthesia described by Pinsker (Pinsker 1986) incorporated immobility (absence pressure) to stimulus, reflects analgesia are the main three (Prys -Roberts 1987) defined anesthesia as a state in which an individual is incapable to perceive or recall a noxious minimal risk to the animal (Haskins 1996) . When dogs are an esthetized, un consciousness is expected . But causes unconsciousness is harder to establish. The present knowledge of mechanisms that produce unconsciousness is very limited in humans , and even more limited in animals. In order to better understand consciousness in humans, it was separated from memory , memory itself separated in two forms : implicit and explicit. Consciousness is defined as the capability to execute simple motor task s in response to a verbal command ; explicit memory is the capability to recall events or words ; implicit memory represents of the subconscious and normally is related with changes in performance these concepts to , it is easy to see that veterinarians do not face an easy task. As owners sometimes report changes in the behaviour of their animal after the surgical procedures , this could lead us to thinking could be a surgical awareness. Nevertheless there are several factors that can be associated with these behavioural changes, since the environment and medical procedures are and its implications. Prior to this, there is one main question that is worth addressing: 26 1.1.2 -How deep are our veterinary patients anesthetized ? That question still goes on puzzling as time goes by because the concept of de ep anaesthesia is dimensionless . Some reports , on human medical literature refer to the difficult y that teachers have to explain the students how deep anesthetized the is. \"The experienced teacher, clinically satisfactory, often says the patient is in the second plane and walks away before he is asked to explain how he arrived at this decision \"(Jacoby, Hamelberg et al. 196 0) . Since the anesthesia was first introduced during the last century, multiple sugges tions were to administer ed to patient. The has been evaluated based pulse rate, ocular signs, muscular tonus and respiration (Cullen, Eger et al. 1972) . Interestingly enough, back in 1960, , experienced anesthesiologists claimed the most patients is respiration in accordance Despite of the possibility of using the depth , indicator of more underlying problem s. There are a lot physiologic events hypoxemia, hyperthermia, and 1996; Clarke related to depth of ether anesthesia for humans, which have been applied to animals in a first effort to characterized the depth of anesthesia (Soma 1971; of depth of and respiration. Haskins described a variety signs that can be helpful to evaluate the depth of anesthesia in dogs (Table (Haskins Light reflex Yes Maybe Veterinary Clinics of North . s pontaneous movement s in dogs anaesthetised with ether, which can be associated to a light or inadequate anesthesia . Nevertheless, these observations were reported . Under the same conditions, the same authors observed in different dogs that by decreasing the depth of anesthesia , correlated with a post -operatively recall Couture et al. that the concentration to produce amnesia and unconsciousness is -40% of the needs to inhibit movement 1993) were propofol action at the lumbar dorsal spinal cord (Antognini, Wang et al. 2000) of anesthesia as anesthesia a resul t of simultaneous actions at different sites in central nervous system . of depth inimum alveolar concentration 28 (MAC ) was first describ ed by Merkel and Eger (Merkel and Eger 1963) , and is by definition the steady anesthetic selected noxious stimulation (Merkel and Eger 1963) . Therefore, and as exposed in the last paragraph regarding the percentage of hypnotic to produce unconsciousness, using MAC as one wants to , Hendersoh and colleagues of under ether anesthesia . According to those authors, i n early stages of anesthesia the higher nervous centres are depressed, but the lower motor centres are not inhibited , leading to an increase in the muscular tonus ; on the other hand, in deep stages of anesthesia , the lower motor centre eyelids. clinical evaluation become fact muscular is influenced by the of the patients (larger dogs have more tonus ), and in some dogs it is almost impossible to detect the presence of mandib ular for example, to their an ideal veterinarians the . Ocular refle xes and eyeball position are two of the most used s igns to a ccess the depth and colleagues reported that the eyeball is one of the most important signs in anesthesia at that time . As long as the eyeball is oscillating or is in an eccentric position though stationary, there is no danger that too much ether has been given. A side from extraneous circumstances, such as is stationary but eccentric, the patient safe and in condition (Guedel 1966) . 29 In veterinary anesthesia halothane and es ventromedia lly lly, returning to a central position in deeper level s of anesthesia (Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) . However, there are some animal s in which the eyeball position never changes (Haskins 1992) , this is a very important fact to bear when one only uses are many variations between individuals, and consequently it is not a reliable sign itself that can accurately The the eyelids , is a commonly useful Its occur rence means that the is light of an aesthesia . If palpebral reflex is absent or depressed, the patient could be in a medium to a deep level of anesthesia (Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) . The corneal reflex may also gentle touch in the cornea, and should not any corneal damage. This reflex causes some controversy regardin g in depth of anesthesia . So me veterinary anaesthesiologists refer that cor neal reflex is not a sign of deep anesthesia (Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) , while others report that this reflex should always be present , unless the patient is anaesthetised absence moist cornea autonomic nervous system, it is expected that t he heart rate and blood pressure decrease , when the level of depth al. can depression of anesthesia (Hug 1990) . Thus, these for patient's . According to the previous on any sign , but use as much information as possible from the visual interaction with the patient, and from hemodynamic monitors. There is one study that produce d a visual analogue scale (VAS) 30 for pigs (Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2003) based on the clinical experience of the researchers , and on the information suggested in Lumb & Jones Veterinary Anesthesia access depth of anesthesia in pigs (Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2 003). Anesthetic planes Variables 1 2 3 4 5 Conscious Yes No No No No Breathing Rate Normal Irregular and Increase Moderately irregular and abdominal Thoracic and abdominal Thoracic and abdominal Dilated Position Increased -Cancho, Lima et al. 2003) . 32 1.2- Why do we need monitors to ass ess the depth of anesthesia? The depth of anesthesia is usually by the response measured to certain stimulus, by the site reflex it is extremely important to have a detailed knowledge of mechanism of action of different drugs used in anesthesia , order the clinical signs (Haskins 1992) . The major goal in veterinary and human anesthesia is to quantify the depth of anesthesia and, at the same time, to evalua te the level of unconsciousness that cannot be measure objectively. be a step towards the standardization of anesthetic practice in institutional animal care, in clinical p ractice in research practice, use that can monitor the depth of anesthesia in paralyzed animal s reduce s the chanc e of intraoperat ive awareness , or of overdos the very may lead to a completely change of personality, making living a nightmare for th ese patients establish (Haskins 1996) , not not frequent . Despite of the of the effect of the anesthetic agent(s) on the central nervous system has remained a challenge (Moerman, Bonke et al. 1993) . There are studies in humans that refer the aware ness of the patient when the hemodynamic parameters remain stable (Flaishon, Windsor et The same principles are applied to veterinary anesthesia (Hall, Clarke et al. 2001) , but the veterinary ane sthetists have few alternatives to the depth of anesthesia besides monitoring the autonomic parameters. The cardiovascular appear to be a balance between sympathetic stimulation and the direct depressant effects of on the like CO 2, can influence such activity (Cullen, Eger et al. 1972) . of anesthesia monitor has faced the problems related with the fact that t here is no clinical measurement that include s all anesthesia, different action different physiological responses. This makes t he use opioids like fentanyl can alter the heart rate, consider balanced anesthe sia uses of different drugs, with different effects, to achieve a more stable monitoring anesthetic procedures require additional clinical information, where activity is of the most important pa rameters. Many anesthesiologists confess that sometimes they have in less of a particular drug, is a with several advantages Hamelberg et al. 1960) . The brain activity has an important relevance to assess the The of . New computer analysis can process the EEG to give us valuable information about the level of unconsciousness. Currently , the challenge , the veterinary anesthesiologist s do not have a reliable tool to monitor the \"brain state\". 34 1.3- What is the origin of the EEG? 1.3.1 - The electrical activity in the brain. The EEG is by definition a recording of a spontaneous electrical activity of the cerebral cortex, and it represents the net summation of electric currents by cerebral The large pyramid of cells arranged sides by side in the fifth layer of the brain are responsible for the neuronal source of the EEG. The long straight apical dendrites, and neighboring dendrites have allowed the creation of dipoles in the neuro ns that cause currents to flow , which will have a greater effect on the surface electro des (Rampil 1998; Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . The EEG had no regular, repetitive despite o f the large ongoing research in animals for human purposes that boasted since the 19th century. In 1875 Caton described the presence of electrical current in the brain using a galvanometer in rabbits and monkeys (Caton 1875) . Hans Berger of Jena, the \"father of electroencephalography\", recorde d the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes in the head surface (Berger 1933) . Nevertheless, the researchers have only studied in 1937 the relationship between anesthesia and the EEG, when Gibbs and Lennox hypothesized that the electroencephalogram is sensitive to anesthetic agents (Gibbs, Gibbs et al. 1937) . In the same year, Loomis and colleagues described systematic changes of the EEG during human sleep, and were the first to describe five anesthetic stages, A -E, to distinguish different EEG patterns (Loomis, Harvey et al. 2-EEG patterns (A) Represents a high frequency and low amplitude of the waves. The application In low lead to a short -term high fre quency beta With flat EEG by were introduced by Klem and Mallo in 1966 (Klemm and Mallo 196 6). The EEG is considered a possible measurement to assess to physiological changes in cerebral metabolism 1 986) and in cerebral blood flow (Kuramoto, Oshita et al. 1979; Dong, Bledsoe is described using three basic parameters: 1. Amplitude is the size, or voltage of the recorded signal and ranges from 5 V to 500 mV . 2. Frequency is the number of times per second the signal oscillates or crosses the zero voltage line (Stanski 2000) . It is very interesting that the fluctuations are in a relatively narrow range from 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz, with most of the frequencies below 30 Hz (Holliday and Colette 1999) . 3. Time is the duration of the sampling of the signal. The set of sequential samples is named an epoch, and the collection an EEG is entitle ensemble of the power spectrum variance. In contrast the averaging obliterate the characteristics EEG pattern (Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . Contamination of the signal could be introduced by artifact s frequencies produced by end (Rampil 1998) . Otto has been studying in dogs the effects of the different averaging on the EEG analysis in dogs and conclude that e pochs subjected to averaging. The average of 20 to 30 second period could the best for detecting changes in EEG data when an intense applied (Otto 2007) . From the clinical point of view, fort unately the brain has the tendency to limit the variation in the wave patterns when the The high frequencies and waves predominate during the waking state, and the slower and waves predominate during sleep or under anesthesia (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) Higher cortical promote independently, creating the conscious behavior of the . Desynchronization has been 37 described animals when a noxious stimulus was applied (Antognini, Carstens et al. 2000) . One of the most interesting challenge in the analysis of EEG is the the of changes Synchronization of in slowing referred as synchronization 2008) in cats by and colleagues et coll described that . 1.3.2 -Artifacts s some and ha ve be taken in account when the EEG is analyzed. from the head Artifacts from outside the head may include noise from electrical equipment, power line artifacts (which are the most impo Voss 2009) . 1.3.2.2 -Artifacts from the head outside the brain The artifact from the head but outside the brain is mainly the electromyography (EMG). The EMG cannot be filtered out completely, and for this reason could influence the analysis of the EEG (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . Des pite the artifact effect of the EMG, the usefulness of this parameter as additional information about the anesthetic state of the patient is 38 controversial (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . Campagnol and colleagues stud ies the effect noxious produced by electrical stimulation . It was observed that a stimulation the BIS increased significantly in all treatments, but it must be taken in account that they founded a high correlation between cautiously awareness but to EMG response. (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) 1.3.2.3 - Artifact within the brain The artifacts with origin in the brain are not well described in veterinary anesthesia because the alteration in EEG due to artifact that are the like: patients, noxious stimulus may cause an increase in namely, cardiac arr est could slow the EEG waves (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . 39 1.4 What are the principles to analyze connected skin is essential to obtain a reliable interpretation of the signa l (Rampil 1998) . In 1959 Martin and Faulconner exposed the di fficulty in rec ording the EEG in the Faulconer 1959 ; Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . Nevertheless, the major problem was to perform a quantitative analysis of the EEG. first EEG were visual, requiring highly qualified personnel for the interpretation of the EEG. even so, highest average correlation , from percent McEwen et al. 1976) . In the 80s , the advance in electronic technology brought about a renewed interest in the analysis of intraoperative EEG. The large amount of the raw EEG could analyzed due to newer computer earlie st statistic al analysis used for EEG was the period analysis. This method quantifies the number o f times the EEG line cross es the zero and can be performed manually (Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . Nevertheless, the obvious limitations of this analysis led to the use of other more accurate and computerized methods. 1.4.1 -Power Spectrum Analysis The conversion The analysis of the epoch is performed by using the Fast in different amplitude at a certain frequency range. The sum of these sinusoidal waves represents the original waveform. The use of power analysis as the measurement of the amplitude is a convention reflecting the origins of Fourrier analysis in radio engineering (Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . The power spectrum analysis is then calculated squaring the 40 amplitude of the individual frequency compone nt (Fig .3.2) and analysis. The original continuous waveform (A). Digital form of the EEG samples (B). Fourrier analysis into a microproces sor (C). Histogram of the power spectrum (D). Adapted from (Levy, Shapiro et al. 1980) . The Power spectrum analysis take s into account frequency and amplitude information of the EEG waves but angle is not analysed. The angle( time offset of zero (Sigl and Chamoun 1994) . The phase related to the of analysis phase angles is u nclear. I n general, the awake brain has mult iple signal pacemakers, working independently with Spectral edge frequency The spectral edge frequency (SEF) is a statistical analysis of the EEG derived from power spectrum that represents the frequency below which 95% (SEF95%) of the power spectrum is located. Some authors use the SEF80% (Long, total EEG power spectrum located (Schwender, Daunderer et al. of four frequency bands the percentage distribution of total power of each frequency band (Otto, Voight et al. 1996) . The power band ratios, relative fractional power, relative fractional power, and relative fractional power are all related to the power (Long, Shah et al. 1989) . All of this measurements derived from the power spectrum analysis are designed by quantitative electroencephalogram variables (QEEG) (Otto 20\u00b5g and the poor performance. 42 1.4.2 -Bispectral analysis The Bispectral analysis a processing technique that quantifies nonlinear and linear changes in analysis the relation between two primary f1 and f2, these frequencies f1+f2, detecting phase - coupling within the signal, variation as a response to the external stimulu coupling tends non zero (Sigl and Chamoun 1994) . The bispectrum is not j ust a reflex of phase coupling, as it is influenced by the amplitude of the EEG signal and by the degree of phase coupling. Bicoherence is used to incorporate th high bicoherence value at (f1, f2) indicates that there is a couplin g within the triplet of f2 may have probably the n The BSR is characterized by alternating periods of normal t o high voltage activity with low voltage or isoelectric EEG EEG should not exceed \u00b15.0 mV to be assumed as BS pattern. The time in a suppresse d state is measured, and the BSr is the fraction of the epoch length where the is EEG most of the artifact s influencing the EEG will present a millivolt magnitude. This makes the quality and consistency of the electrode to skin connection essential to the reliable interpretation of the signal. The quantification of impedance is important to evaluate the quality of the electrical contact between the EEG electrode and the skin. In a simplistic definition , the impedance means the \"resistance\" or not to the electric current flow. Low impedance occurs when you have low re sistance s to the electrical current , which means a good contact between the skin and the electrode, allowing an increase in the quality of the High impedance For example, the BIS monitor needs impedance values lower than 7,5 k to startup (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . On the other hand , the Cerebral State Monitor needs impedance values lower than 5 k skin electrodes used for neurological diagnosis usually have a multipolar assemble , but this is during routine anesthe tic procedures. changes in the frontal cor tex activity which allow the use of the forehead to stick the EEG skin electrodes to quantify the anesthetic effects on the brain electric activity (Bennett, Voss et al. 2009) . In bipolar assembles , derivations are formed by two electrodes that are acknowledged to be located over active cerebral tissue. It is that the form chains oriented longitudinally the . There are different electrodes assembles described in dogs : frontal -occipital (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007; Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) (Fig. 4), bifrontal (Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin Cancho et al. 2004) (Fig. 5), and frontal -temporal (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) (Fig. 6). Bergamasco and colleagues described the anterior areas of the brain with predominance preva lence of slowing frequency bands 2003) . 4-Represents the frontal -occipital position of All electrodes are in the midline. Electrode 1 is placed 1 cm dorsal to an imaginary line connecting the medial canthi of the eyes, and electrode 3 was placed on the occipital crest. Because of the design of the sensor, electrodes 2 (ground), and 4 (reference) were placed at 2 -cm distance f rom . the -temporal position of electrodes. The 1 was placed in the midline on the rostral portion of an imaginary line connecting the zygomatic process of the frontal bone, and the caudal portion of the frontal crest . Electrodes 2 (ground) and 4 (reference) were each placed an angle of 15o to 30o to transverse plane. As a result of this electrode 2 placed to the of the left 3 was placed on the zygomatic process, to the base of the left ear Teixeira Neto et al. 2007). Figure 5-Represents the bifrontal position of electrodes Electrodes 1 and 3 were placed 1 cm caudal to the lateral canthus of each eye. Electrode 4 (reference) was placed on midline, and electrode 2 (ground) was placed between electrodes 1 and 4 (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) . 45 1.5.1 -Types of electrodes: The most used brain monitor is the BIS monitor , and most of the studies performed in dogs us es the BIS Quatro Sensor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, Mass) . In order to use this sensor in dogs, it is necessary to shave the dogs' head, which is a practice . Green and colle the performance between patch electrode (BIS sensor, medical systems Inc) and subdermal electrodes using a platinum needles. They concluded that both types of electrodes had similar skin impedance, and the results obtained routine clinical us e, and because they cost of EEG monitor ing (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al. 2006) . Hemmerling and Harvey refer that the use of ECG c electrodes could replace the patch electrodes of the BIS monitor after a good preparation of the head in humans (Hemmerling and Harvey 2002) . The same results were observed for the CSI monitor the ) electrodes maintained the 2007) . In conclusion, to record the EEG it can small electrodes placed in disk electrodes skin surface , or small attached to the skin the , 46 assess dept Two concepts must be taken in account when looking fo r a good monitor for depth of anesthesia: validity and reliability. Validity accuracy and is difficult to quantify since there is no gold standard for anesthetic depth. Validity represents the agreement between the monitor and eference instrument (Bruhn, Myles et al. evaluated by testing and retesting the reliability, in this case concurrent or repetitive measurements of depth of anesthesia will be comparable at a stable anesthetic state with clinical variables for the example (Bruhn, Myles et al. 2006) . 1.6.1 -Characteristics and qualities of the ideal monitor to measure the depth of anesthesia. 1.6.1.1 - Analysis of the EEG as tool to assess the anesthetic de pth. To use monitors to evaluate anesthesia we must assume the EEG represents a cluster of pos -synaptic potentials that can accurately and reliably correlated with anesthetic states (Stanski 2000) It still unclear which is the optimal EEG processing technique for brai n monitor, and EEG indices with evoked potentials show the best potential, and are curren tly under development (Schneider, Hollweck et al. 2005) . An important consideration in the evaluation of clinical monitors is the distinction between the desired sign al, and the artifact s on the EEG and on EMG (Edmonds and 1985) . and It gradually anesthetic concentrations will be reflected the (fig. 7). In 1977, Stullken and col leagues described that, rapidly decrease of cerebral oxygen consumption when the dogs pass from the awake to anesthetized state (Stullken, Milde et al. 1977) . Thus, anesthetic concentration is typically sigmoidal. Beyond the los s of there is a plateau in the et al. 2009) . This has some implications in the use of brain monitors to titrate drugs near the plateau, it will be difficult for the monitor to correlate with anesthetic depth to the correlation of the EEG derived indexes with MAC, and multiples of MAC valu es (Greene, Benson et al. 2002; Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin Canc ho et al. 2004; Neto sigmoidal The most informative range of the EEG monitor lies in region 2, where small changes in anesthetic dose lead to large changes in EEG Region represents a range in which the EEG monitor provides little information acr oss a wide range in anesthetic concentration. The ommonly of the of response stimulus (Greene, Benson et al. 2002; Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin Cancho et al. 2004; Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) . 49 The burst suppression is another reasonable endpoint. This type of cerebral electrical activity is not observed in the natural sleep, and it is observed in depth levels of light edation to surgical of combinations of should not affect the accuracy of respond to surgical stimulus when anesthesia is inadequate. The monitor display should be quantified, to assess depth obtained from spontaneous electrical activity from the brain and a second type of moni tor, which analyze combine Newton, MA, USA ) was the first technology appro ved by US Food and drugs administration (October 1996) to 100 . These correspond to complete electrical silence to awake respectively (Johansen and Sebel 2000) . The BIS i complex parameter that integrates a various EEG descriptors into a single variable (John and Prichep 2005) . The first step on the BIS construction starts with the exclusion of the art ifacts from high - and low -frequency. The art ifacts detected are removed from amount of burst suppression, another concept introduced in the analysis of burst suppression called QUAZI and w as Johansen and Sebel 20 00). the same time the fast fourier transform ation , power spectrum and the bispectrum of the are calculated. The values obtained are the n computed to Beta ratio and Synchfastslow. The Beta ratio is the subparameter based on the power of two frequency analysis ( Fig 8 ). An important concept in the development of the BIS is the fact that th ese (Glass, Bloom et al. 1997) . 51 The BIS is the most studied depth of anesthesia monitor in veterinary anesthesia, there different kind of species, cats, dogs, pigs, horses, goats and rabbits (Antognini, Wang et al. 2000; Greene, Benson et al. 200 2; Haga and Dolvik 2002; March and Muir Carrasco -Jimenez al. 2004; Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) . All of this studies were performed with inhalant anesthetics and the effects of MAC and MAC multiples on BIS were evaluated. In all of th ese species the reference values for surgical anesthesia fo unded. Green and colleges studied the relationship between BIS multiples of sevoflurane MAC (0.8, 1, 1.5 and 2) with concomitant administration of neuromuscular blocking effect EMG on values of BIS, since is k nown that EMG is the principal source of the art ifacts. It was observed a decrease in BIS values when multiples MAC increase. Nevertheless this reduction was not significant differen t between all MAC multiples detected by BIS (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . Another study with different concentration of isoflurane, in absence of noxious s timulus showed poor correlation with BIS, which implies BIS changes on dep of anesthesia (Campagnol, Teixeira Neto et al. 2007) . In BIS monitor the presence of burst suppression could lead to a false increase of BIS values . This is due to the fact that this pattern is recognized by the monitor as high frequency related with a more awake brain (March and Muir 2005) . The results obtained in different studies suppression dogs anestheti zed with sevoflurane at 2MAC multiple (Greene, Benson et al. 2002; Greene, Tranquilli et al. 2003) . This could reflex slight of specie anesthetic drug combinations (Green, Benson et al. 2 002). The effects of propofol on BIS in dogs are not well studied, there are just one study using three infusion rates of propofol and. forty and fifty minutes after the beginning of the infusions there a greater decrease in BIS values for infusion 0,8 mgkg-1h-1 when compared with infusions at 0,2 and 0,4mgkg-1h-1 (Lopes, Nunes et al. 2008) . One of the limitations of this study is the administration of the bolus before the start of the infusions which can interfere in the consequent analysis of the BIS at dif ferent infusion rates during the first thirty minutes . 52 There are a lack of studies in dogs that evaluate the relationship between clinical end at the resumption of th ese reflexes (Carrasco -Jimenez, Martin Cancho et al. 2004) . The measure of the anesthetic effect on the brain be independent of of a -agent approach with the simultaneous use of it clear what the effect of a specific dr ug is on the BIS. The association of medetomidine with isoflurane was related with decrease in BIS values compared with use of isoflurane alone . (Greene, et al. 2003) . The are currently used in association wi th general anesthetics and it is known that they dose of volatile anesthetics and propofol used (Vuyk 1 997). A study performed with standard doses of morphine associated to a constant concentration of isoflurane showed that administration of fenta on MAC of isoflurane and consequently in BIS values in dogs. It was founded that BIS increased as MAC of isoflurane decreased when dogs were treated with fentanyl, perzinfotel, or both. n (Ueyama, Lerche et al. 2009) . This study did not reflect the effect of fentanyl or the perzinfotel on BIS since the values of isoflurane concentration were not constant. Similar conclusions were observed in the study evaluat ing the effect consequently BIS increased as M AC of isoflurane decreased in of the from anesthesia Bellville 1977) . 53 Intra -operative BIS conscious BIS predict the depth anesthesia for every patient as it considered the interindividua l variability in drug response. The change BIS after a noxious stimulus a direct measure in suppressing nociceptive transmission and hypnotic state (March and Muir 2005) . Recently the BIS was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia in p uppies using multiples of sevoflurane MAC, it was observed the capacity of BIS, at lower level of anesthesia, to respond a noxious concentrations (Morgaz, 2009) . The BIS was also studied in cats were . Leigh and colleagues studied the effects on BIS by different MAC multiples of sevoflurane and isoflurane, it was observed in both studies that the BIS values recorded were low, which means that the endpoints humans could not be ied to cats (Lamont, Greene et al. 2004; Lamont, Greene et al. 2005) . The BIS was also studied in pigs, rabbits and with Dolvik Martin -Cancho, Carrasco -Jimenez et al. 2004; Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) . In goats the studies performed showed that BIS can be used anesthesia, nevertheless more . Figure 8-Represents the flow chart for the calculation of BIS ,adapted from (Rampil 1998) . 54 55 - Spectral have nonlinear behavior like the EEG waveforms and are considered not a sum of sine waves but a cha otic pattern (Pritchard and Duke 1992) The truer understanding of the brain changes that result in a chaotic dynamics should be nonlinear models (Walling and Hicks a of in the EEG (Vanluchene, Vereecke et al. 2004) . Shannon and Weaver were the first to describe entropy in 1949 (Shannon 1948) and in 1984 John and Shore applied it to a power spectrum. Entropy describes the . Various entropy algorithms been developed in the past two decades to characterize the signal of EEG. It could be computed a time domain called the approximate entropy or Shannon entropy and in frequency domai n calle d spectral entropy. The first step the algorithms used in Entropy TM Module (Date x- Ohmeda Helsinki, Finland ) the caption of the spectrum applying the FFT, thereafter a called Shannon entropy is applied to get the spectral entropy. The principal advantage of this approach is of absolute scales For optimal response to minimized the time delay of the monitor a time window for each particular frequency i s individually chosen, for example, a t a frequency of 0.5Hz, a time window of 30 s would be required to obtain 15 full cycles of the variation. For a frequency of 50Hz, the same number of full cycles could be obtained with only 0.3 s of data. This leads to a concept call ed ). In the entropy module, the shortest time window range between 32Hz and 47Hz. frequencies between these two extremes are used. The very short window of less than 2s for range of the biosignal collected from the skin of the forehead and the side of the head, it contains both EEG and EMG of the frontal muscle. The EMG signal has a wide noise -like spectrum with frequencies higher than 30 Hz, the than 30 Hz during an esthesia (Viertio - Oja, Maja et al. 2004) . It is importa nt to refer that in humans the facial muscles are less sensitive to muscles to r S/5 monitor shows that from frequency ranges, namely State entropy (SE) and Response entropy SE is computed with a frequencie between 0,8Hz and 32 Hz which represents the EEG and a small amount of RE computed originates mainly in the EMG and only a small part in the EEG, the EMG activity is calculated the by difference of the RE and SE values. The short calculation delay between 32 and 47Hz the frontal muscle (i.e. 'adequate' is no activity over 32Hz in the biosignal, and the RE and SE values Yli -Hankala io-Oja, . The monitor shows the values of BSR, nevertheless did no t affect the calculation of SE and Re. The a-dimensional values of SE vary between 0 and 91. RE values oscillate from 0 to 100 .The RE -SE difference is used to measure ption 2006) . With an awake subject, EEG is highly irregular, and the amount entropy (Fig 9 and 10 ). There is just one study in dogs that evaluate the spect ral entropy to measure the anesthetic depth and antinociception (Morgaz, Granados et al. 2 010). The main reason for the use of this monitor is the fact that the analysis of the EEG being independent of the frequency or amplitude of the signal. For the authors t his is a potential advantage for its use in veterinary medicine because it may all ow for EEG an depth monitoring M/Entropy S/5 57 can distinguish between awake and unconscious state because the monitor could predict the movement of the animals at 0,75 sevoflurane MAC. It was found a paradoxical pattern at 1,75 MAC which leads to the elevation of spectral index when compared to 1,5 MA C, that makes the monitor unable to detect different depth 58 flow chart for S/5 Entropy sine only one nonzero spectral component, which is normalized to 1 in the normalization step (2). In the Shannon mapping, both values 1 and 0 contribute to a value of 0, thus corresponding to entropy=0. B) Some amount of white no ise is superimposed on top of the sine wave. After normalization, the spectrum includes one high component corresponding to the frequency of the sine wave, and 6 smaller nonzero components. In the Shannon mapping, both types of components contribute nonzer o values to the entropy of the signal, corresponding to a total entropy =0.12 * 6 * 0.08 =0.60. Adapted from Maja et al. Narcotrend the depth of anesthesia and developed at the Medical School , University of Hannover, Germany. The principle of this monitor is the establishment of a database of EEG patterns which are classified based on the principles first described by Loomis and colleges in 1937, where during the sleep there are systematic changes classified in five stages fro m A to E (Loomis, Harvey et al. 1937) . More recently Shultz and colleges create a substages A, B 0-2, C0-2, D 0-2, E0,1 and F 0,1 (Schultz, Schultz et al. 2000) in an attempt to characterized and index was as an indication for the depth of anesthetic level; from 100 to 90=awake, from 89 to 80=sedation, from 79 to 65=lightly anestheti zed, from 64 to 37=general anesthesia, from 36 to 13=deeply hypnoti 1=increased EEG silence (Kreuer and Wilhelm In the development of Narcotrend monitor a database, was incorporated with the typical examples of EEG from were visually classified to form the basis for the development of automatic classification algorithms (Kreuer and Wilhelm 2006) . For the classificatio Fourier transformation is applied and a numerous quantitative features from the time and the frequency domain were extracted, power spectrum of the four frequency power bands ( ; 0.5 -3.5 Hz, ; 3.5 -7.5 Hz, ; 12.5 - Hz) , MF the SEF sub stages. This \"memory\" created in the monitor could be called the background of the monitor. When a new patient is contribute to the discriminant functions are calculat ed, and the epoch is classified into one of the sub stages. A sufficient similarity of the epoch to one of the typical 60 elect roencephalographic stages is required for a classification to be made (Fig 11) (Kreuer, Biedler et al. 2003; Kreuer and Wilhelm 2006) . A study o narcotend was used (der Linde, Van Deuren et al. 2010) . Van der Linde and colleges concluded that it is possible to reliably that during anesthesia with fentanyl/etomidate protocol t he Narcotr end index calculated in six dogs was between 6 4 and 38 units (general a nesthesia) and stable over 3h. All of this dogs were under the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents (der Linde, Van Deuren et al. 2010) .

These are used to define two energy ratios called alpha ( ) and beta ( ). Both and show a shift in the energy content from the higher to the lower frequencies with deeper anesthesia. The relationship between these shifts is a lso analy zed by CSM as a separate parameter (-). The monitor, who works -line, also parameters then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic classifier system that calculates the CSI. Fuzzy reasoning the processes be successfully applied to on a no restricted mathematical structure ; the data is analy zed with no prior assumption of the mathematical relationship between variables. The advantage of using ANFIS is that it is a data -driven approach that doe s not assume an underlying mathematical model governing the (Gambus, Jensen et al. 2010) . There are just one study with CSM monitor made with concurrent decrease BSR a of es to assess electrical brain The is based on evoked of oscillations the brain electrical activity, derived from the EEG to a different st : auditory, (Thornton Sharpe 1998) .

The repetition of sound inputs and the use of computer averaging and filtering techniques allow the AEP to be distinguished from EEG background noise. The signal is time -locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out of repeated response (Thornton and Sharpe . important features of of anesthesia monitors is extract surgery. In attempt use MAEP during anesthesia different approaches were used to reduce the complexity of AEP and permit the of AEP Gajraj al. Mantzaridis and 1998) . The AEP indexes ha ve been proposed a s single numerical variable based on the morphol ogy of the curves and is calculated from the difference of the amplitude of successive segments of the curve. This numerical variable is determined by a moving time average of 3 seconds intervals (Doi, Gajraj et al. 1997) . Recent advances had permit the development method for analysis of the MLAEP resulted in autoregressive model with an exogenous input (ARX model). ARX model is used to analy ze these amplitudes and latencies to derive a dimensionless number bet ween 0 and 100 known as the A -line ARX -Index (AAI Index - Fig. 13) (Jensen, Lindholm et al. 1996; Vereecke, Vasq uez et al. 2005) . The MLA EP has been studied in dogs with conflicting results. Murrell and colleagues evaluate MLAEP in awake dogs after two concentra tion of sevoflurane, it was observed that sevoflurane cause alterations in the waveforms with an increase of the latency in the peaks P0, Na and Pa, however there was no differences between low and high concentration of sevoflurane by Van Oostrom and index was applied in a closed loop anesthetic system in dogs to control the delivery of propofol.

The core services grew at a rate of 10% during the last decade, which is mainly due to medical advances (Brady and Palmeri 2007) . The anthropomorphization of pets led the pet owners to want the same best -in-class care for their pets , as for medicine that \"per se\" does not promote the cure of the allows the develo pment of increasingly complex surgical and medical procedures. A large study performed UK death of 0,17% for dogs, and 0,24% for cat s within 48 hours after the procedure. In healthy dogs and cats the results were 0,05% and 0,11% respectively. On the hand in sick patients the were seriously higher: standard monitoring measures are heart noninvasive blood pressure and arterial oxygen saturation. The monitoring the depth of anesthesia in its applicability in dogs. Additionally, in recent years there was a progressive transition from the use of volatile agents to the anesthesia , being a common practice and, in many cases, the technique of choice . However, the developments in Veterinary anesthesia . The lack of studies between of anesthesia and an objective visual EEG depression and anesthesia using the reasons explained ab ove the overall purposes of this thesis are the improvement of expected 71 Objetivos de la memoria de tesis doctoral (espanhol) Como declaro el Presidente de la \"American Animal Hospital Association\", estamos asistiendo a una evoluci\u00f3n importante de la Profesi\u00f3n Veterina ria, debido principalmente a los avances m\u00e9dicos, lo que nos ha llevado entre otras causas a un aumento de mas del 10% en los servicios veterinarios (Brady; Palmeri 2007). La antropomorfizacion, utilizando el t\u00e9rmino en el sentido de que se atribuyen cuali dades humanas a las mascotas, hace que sus due\u00f1os quieran que los cuidados de salud que se presten a sus mascotas sean tan buenos como los que reciban ellos mismos. En el caso de la anestesia, campo de la medicina que permite el desarrollo de procedimiento s quir\u00fargicos y m\u00e9dicos cada vez m\u00e1s complejos, se demanda que cada vez sea m\u00e1s segura y eficiente. En un estudio multic\u00e9ntrico realizado en el Reino Unido cuya finalidad era evaluar la calidad de la anestesia y sedaci\u00f3n y en el que participaron 117 centro s veterinarios entre los resultados obtenidos (98.036 perros y 79.178 gatos) podemos rese\u00f1ar El porcentaje de mortalidad en animales anestesiados fue del 0,1 % en perros y 0,24 % para los gatos, considerando el periodo de tiempo, desde el comienzo de la anestesia hasta 48 horas despu\u00e9s de finalizar el procedimiento quir\u00fargico. El porcentaje de mortalidad en perros gatos sanos anestesiados fue de 0,05 y 0,11 % respectivamente. El porcentaje en pacientes enfermos anestesiados los valores fueron mas altos 1,33 % en perros y 1,40 % en gatos (Brodbelt, Blissitt 2008) En anestesia veterinaria la monitorizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1ndar es ritmo cardiaco, presi\u00f3n arterial no invasiva, y la saturaci\u00f3n arterial de ox\u00edgeno, como indicadores b\u00e1sicos. El control de la profundidad de la anestesia se basa solo en signos cl\u00ednicos. En anestesia humana, en los \u00faltimos tiempos est\u00e1 increment\u00e1ndose la utilizaci\u00f3n de la anestesia total intravenosa (TIVA) sobre la anestesia inhalatoria. Esta tendencia no es tan marcada en veterinaria como en humana, pero cada vez se va imponiendo m\u00e1s. Por eso en el presente trabajo quisimos comprobar si la medici\u00f3n de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica se pod\u00eda cuantificar mediante el uso del EEG con ayuda del \"Cerebral State 72 Monitor\" (CSM) para obtener un \u00cdndice de E stado cerebral (CSI) que estuviese relacionado con los planos de anestesia. La falta de estudios de este tema en perros nos llev\u00f3 a realizar el presente estudio con el fin de mejorar la calidad de la anestesia, testar las respuestas del electroencefalogram a durante la anestesia general con propofol, y establecer la relaci\u00f3n de las respuestas cl\u00ednicas durante la anestesia intravenosa con propofol y el \u00edndice de estado cerebral. 73 Chapter 2 2-Material and General Methodology All data routine orchiectomy procedures at Porto Veterinary Hospital.

The sensitivity of samples (14bits equivalent), with second update. To the CSI, frequencies outside the 6 -42 Hz range were filt ered out. The CSI is based on the combination of four subparameteres of the electroencephalographic signal ( ratio, ratio, - ratio a nd BS. The first th ree are depict ed from the spectral analysis and the four th is the burst BSr calculated by the monitor. These sub -parameters are used to define two energy ratios called alpha ( ) and beta ( ). Both and show a shift in th e energy content from the highest to the l owest frequencies with in deeper an These subparameteres are by the follow ing approach (Formula 1) Formula 1: The energy of EEG is evalua ted in specific frequency bands used to define two energy ratios called alpha () and beta (). Both show a shift in the energy content from higher to lower frequencies during anesthesia. The relationship these is separate parameter (-) (Danmeter 2004) . Burst suppression is defined as the percentage of time in 30 -s window where the amplitude of the electroencephalographic signal was less then inputs to a fuzzy logic classifier to calculate cerebral state index (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) Scheme 1 . 80 Scheme CSI subparameters . These subparameters are then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic inference system that calculates the CSI. Fuzzy logic is a problem -solving methodology that incorporates a X control prob automatically t hat when one fails, another might good correlate. The burst parameter indicates deep on the spectral parameters will be inferior because they are not good correlates during deep anesthesia with bu rst suppression due to the nonstationary nature of the electroencephalogram in this situation.

The electrode -to-skin by external noise (<2\u00b5Vp -p, <0.4\u00b5V RMS, 1 - 250 Hz). When excessive noise is the -to-skin impedances at 1 k result in a SQI of 100. If the impedance of the white or sensors exceeds 1k impedance is >5k the CSI, BS an d EMG will be blank (\" - -\" displayed) . In our study, impedances were kept low (within 1 k and 3 k ) by using a special wax (Elefix, paste Kohden Corporation, Japan) placed between the electrodes and the skin. High levels of facial muscular or EMG activity can interfere with the CSI under monitor incorporates EMG The EMG bar shows the energy of the EMG level in the 75 -85 Hz frequency band (0 -100 logarithmic). 83 The EEG data collection ended before the movement of the patient to the appropriate positional and the beginning of the surgery. 84 2.3. Anesthetic clinical end points based on ocular reflexes. The assumption proposed in this work was that th e ocular reflexes could describe the anesthetic stage of the dog. The palpebral and corneal reflexes were tested three times with a swab in ser um to prevent lesions in cornea. T his proce dure was made always in the right eye. The reflexes were co nsidered negatives if there were no response to these three stimulations. The palpebral reflex was tested gently at the lateral canthus of the eye, and the corneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the cornea. The patient also as present (+) or absent ( - ); the position of the eyeball as eyeball rotated ventromedially (ERV) if the was looking towards the middle eye corner, or centred (EC) if the pupil was centred between the superior and inferior eyelid. The tests were performed by the same anesthesiologst for all of the dogs and the observed responses allowed the preposition of rotated ventrally (ERV). In the presence of the reflex, it is symbolized as +, in its absence, it is symbolized as . 85 2.4 Anesthetic Protocol Data was collected according to three different protocols. 2.4.1 Anesthetic protocol A Fifteen mixed -breed dogs, ten which female, aged 3.4\u00b12.4 years and weighing 22.5\u00b110.5kg were analyz (Vetoquinol\u00ae; Univete), thirty minutes prior to the b eginning of the induction of an esthesia. Anesthesia was programmed to allow of 600 ml h-1. A propofol bolus mg kg-1 where around 50 seconds after propofol administration et al. 2006) (Ghent Belgium)), running on a personal computer, was used to drive the propofol syringe pump. Propofol infusion was ceased after the bol us administration. At this point the CSI was expected to have attained its minimum value. Then, with a in resulting increase in the CSI values was expected. In order to avoid a total recovery from an esthesia, the study methodology limite d the recovery to a CSI value of 70. Once the CSI reached 70, the study ended; the depth of entire study dogs were allowed to breathe spontaneously via a facial mask administering 100% of oxygen. If apnea were to occur red, the study would be interrupted, intubated, mechanically ventilated subsequently from the final data analysis. No stimuli is applied at any time. 2.4.1 Anesthetic protoc ol B Fourteen 8 25.3\u00b15.28 mgkg1 acepromazine IM (Vetoquinol, Univete, Lure,France) thirty minutes prior to th e beginning of the induction of an esthesia. Anesthesia was divided in the study and surgical periods: the study period had not no external interference and was divide d in induction and 86 maintenance; the surgical period was characterized by external , dogs were allowed to breathe spontaneously via a facial mask where 100% oxygen was provided. 2.4.1. 1 First study In the f irst phase of the study period, propofol was administered at a constant infusion rate of 200 .the dogs w ere sternal recumbence . The first reflexes were tested when the dogs changed to a lateral recumbence without a cervical tonus after the beginning of the propofol infusion. The palpebral and corneal reflexes were tested s with a moistened with serum. The eyeball position was also observed at each test. The tests were performed by the same operator in all dogs The study was stopped if apn ea occurred (no breathe for more than 15 seconds), or hypotension (mean arteria l blood until loss of corneal dogs intubated, the propofol infusion was stopped and the propofol decrease intubation, were ventilated using a circuit to maintain an end-tidal of 35 mmHg level measured by the Datex S/5 monitor . 2.4.1. 1 Second study In the second phase of the study , propofol was administered 6g ml1, 7 g ml1, 9 g ml1 and g ml1. At each level the propofol plasma concentration was minutes re flex was tested three times and was considered negative if there was no response in all three times. The study would be interrupted if hypotension (mean arterial pressure the corneal reflex was lost. Dogs would be discarded from data analysis in the respective propofol were applie d besides testing of the reflexes. 87 2.4 Statistics Heart rate and mean arterial pressure values were collected propofol those PropCp using analysis of The a ifferent plane an esthesia was given to each group of reflexes. Data was for distribution the Shapiro test Spearman to compare CSI and PropCp, CSI and anesthetic planes, and anesthetic plan es and Rank correlation was used to compare anestheti c planes with CSI and EMG. The analysis of the Electroencephalogram parameters change in the last study, in which the relationship between the anesthetic planes and different ste ps of PropCp were explored, based on a n appropriate a . The mathematical basis of PK was described by Smith et al (Smith, Dutton et al. 1996) . A PK value of 1 means that of the indicator predict no better than a 50 -50 chance. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and CSM data (CSI, BS, SQI and EMG) were compared to baseline values (twenty minutes the of to the paired sample T The t ime delays for the CSI calculation range from 53 to 55 (Pilge, Zanner et al. 2006 ). In our analysis, a delay of 50 seconds in CSI data was taken into account when analyzing CSI data. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.13.0 for Windows. 88 Cap\u00edtulo 2 2-Material y Metodolog\u00eda General Los datos analizados en esta memoria se obtuvieron cuando los perros a los que se anestesiaba fueron sometidos a una intervenci\u00f3n quir\u00fargica de orquitectom\u00eda. Los animales proven\u00edan de Sociedades Protectoras que ten\u00edan convenios con el Hospital Veterinario de Oporto (Portugal). Siguiendo el protocolo de forma est\u00e1ndar y rut inaria se obtuvo el consentimiento por escrito, tanto para la anestesia y cirug\u00eda, como para someterlos a los protocolos de este trabajo. . 2.1- Pacientes y estudio hemodin\u00e1mico En el estudio solo se incluyeron perros sanos, evalu\u00e1ndose su estado de salud mediante la historia cl\u00ednica, el examen cl\u00ednico, y an\u00e1lisis cl\u00ednicos (hematocrito, prote\u00ednas totales, urea, etc.). Todos ellos fueron clasificados en el grupo de \"Estado F\u00edsico I\" seg\u00fan la clasificaci\u00f3n ASA. Ninguno de los animales estaba recibiendo ning\u00fan f\u00e1rmaco antes del estudio. Se administraron los f\u00e1rmacos a trav\u00e9s de la vena cef\u00e1lica. Se utilizo una v\u00e1lvula de tres v\u00edas conectada al cat\u00e9ter (una v\u00eda para la administraci\u00f3n del propofol, y otra para la administraci\u00f3n de suero salino (NaCl al 1%) mediante una bomba de infusi\u00f3n de marca \"Braun\" para la administraci\u00f3n del suero a un flujo constante de 10 ml.Kg/h (10 ml. por Kg. de peso vivo/hora), durante todo el tiempo del estudio. La monitorizaci\u00f3n de los par\u00e1metros hemodin\u00e1micos se llevo a cabo m ediante un monitor \"Datex S/5\". Se registr\u00f3 el electrocardiograma en la derivaci\u00f3n II. La presi\u00f3n arterial se midi\u00f3 de modo no invasivo. Se indujo la anestesia con propofol al 1% (Fresenius Kabi; Bad Homburg, Alemania) utilizando una bomba de jeringa (A sena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) programada para permitir una velocidad de infusi\u00f3n m\u00e1xima de 600 ml h-1. El Software de Rugloop II \u00ae (Demed Engineering, Temse, B\u00e9lgica) fue utilizado para guardar los datos del propofol y almacenar todos los datos hemod in\u00e1micos y electroencefalogr\u00e1ficos de los respectivos monitores, cada 5 segundos 89 y tambi\u00e9n para estimar la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de propofol utilizando el modelo farmacocin\u00e9tico de Beths (Beths, Glen et al. 2001). Los datos del Rugloop II R fueron tr atados con el software Labgrab (Demed Engineering, Temse, B\u00e9lgica) y exportados a un archivo de Excel . En el Rugloop Software no es ta incluido , cuando se compra, el modelo farmacocin\u00e9tico del propofol en perros. Fue necesario modificar su programa ci\u00f3n y crear un archivo donde se insert \u00f3 la farmacocin\u00e9tica de Beth\u00b4s. Al comenzar el estudio de cada perro introducimos las variables relacionadas con el peso del animal estudiado. El sistema de anestesia utilizado para la recogida de datos se muestra en la figura.15 El software Rugloop permite controlar la jeringa infusora con diferentes formas de administraci\u00f3n de l propofol : bolus, tasa de infusi\u00f3n constante y TCI to the operator control the Asena syringe pump(D). 91 Fig 16 - Rugloop II Software. 92 2.2- Monitorizaci\u00f3 n del \"Cerebral state index\" (CSI). El \u00edndice de estado Cerebral (CSI) es un \u00edndice con el que se quiere evaluar la profundidad de la anestesia y que es calculado por el \"Cerebral State Monitor\" (CSM, figura 17) utilizando t\u00e9cnicas de procesamiento de l EEG. Figure 17 : a) CSI monitor (image from CSI user manual). b) Display software in the personal computer . El CSI y la actividad electromiogr \u00e1fica frontal (EMG) son datos recogidos cada cinco segundos por el Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) (Danmeter, DK -5000 Odense C, Dinamarca). Un cable modificado de ECG co n pinzas de coco drilo o aligator se conecta ron al cable CSM. El uso de esos electrodos de pinza facilita el uso cl\u00ednico y reduce el coste del monitor EEG (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al 2000; Akavipat, Dumrongbul et al. 2006). Antes de la aplicaci\u00f3n de los electrodos de pinza la piel se limpia con alcohol 5 minutos antes de la recogida de los datos para permitir su secado (Fig. 18 ). 93 Fig .18 Alligator clamps adapted to collect dog's cerebral data La onda bipolar del EEG en nuestro estudio se deriva de la se\u00f1al grabada por dos posiciones diferentes de los electrodos utilizando tres electrodos en p inza. La primera posici\u00f3n donde se colocada un electrodo se hace de acuerdo con las instrucciones del fabricante para la monitorizaci\u00f3n en humanos de la CSI: en el medio del hueso frontal (blanco), en el lado izquierdo de la frente cerca del borde lateral del ojo y en el proceso mastoides temporal del lado izquierdo de la cabeza (negro). La forma de onda de EEG se deriva de la se\u00f1al registrada entre el electr odo blanco y el negro (Fig 19A e B ). A B Fig 19 A) Dorsal view of canine cranium showing the showing the placement of electrodes during and CSM monitor. CSI electrodes were Placed in left side 94 La segunda posici\u00f3n, teniendo en cuenta la anatom\u00eda de cr\u00e1neo (Fig. 20) y la onda de EEG se deriva de la se\u00f1al registrada entre el electrodo frontopolar (positivo) representada por el color blanco y el electrodo occipital (negativo) representada por el color negro, seg\u00fan estudios de Pele grino y col. (Pellegrino y Sica 2004). El electrodo de referencia se situ\u00f3 en la posici\u00f3n parietal (Fig.21 A y B).

Lateral view of left side of the canine cranium showing the 95 En el State Monitor\" (CSM) se recoge la se\u00f1al de EEG continuamente. La sensibilidad de EEG fue \u00b1400\u00b5V y e l monitor CSM recogi\u00f3 2000 muestras por segundo (14bits equiva lente), con una actualizaci\u00f3n cada segundo. Para calcular el \u00edndice (CSI) se eliminaron las frecuencias que estaban fuera del rango de 6-42 Hz . En el c\u00e1lculo del CSI se utiliza la combinaci\u00f3n d e cuarto subpar\u00e1metros de la se\u00f1al electroencefalogr\u00e1fica. La primera de ellas se deriva del an\u00e1lisis espectral y la cuarta es el ratio de la supresi\u00f3n (BSR %) calculada por el monitor. Estos subpar\u00e1metros se utilizan para definir dos ratios de energ\u00eda lla mados alfa () y beta (). y muestran camb ios de energ\u00eda que se obtienen desde las frecuencias mayores hasta las menores con una anestesia profunda. Estos subpar\u00e1metros se calculan con las siguiente s ecuaciones (F\u00f3rmula 1) Formula 1: The energy of EEG is evaluated in specific frequency bands. These are used to define two energy ratios called alpha () and beta (). Both of these show a shift in energy content from higher to lower frequencies during anesthesia. The relationship between these es as a separate parameter (-).Adapted 2004) . La Salva -Supresi\u00f3n (BSR %)se define como el porcentaje de tiempo en una ventana de 30-s donde la amplitud de la se\u00f1al electroencefalogr\u00e1fica es inferior a 3.5\u00b5V. Estos per\u00edodos de EEG son los que caracterizan los niveles m\u00e1s profundos de hipnosis. Estos par\u00e1metros se usan como entradas , para un clasific ador de l\u00f3gica difusa , que calcula el \u00edndice de estado cerebral (Jensen, Litvan et al 2006) esquema 1 96 Scheme 1. These subparameters are then used as inputs to a fuzzy logic inference system that calculates the CSI. Fuzzy logic is a problem -solving methodology that incorporates a X problem rather than attempting to model a system mathematically. Los cuatro par\u00e1metros mencionados arriba, se utilizan como entradas para esta l\u00f3gica difusa Adaptative Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), qu e regula las normas que rigen las relaciones entre los par\u00e1metros de entrada (Fig 22) . . Figure 22 - Representative scheme from Jensen et al., 1996) 97 El CSI tiene una escala de 0 a 100 (tabla. 2.1), donde 0 indica un EEG plano y 100 indica la actividad del EEG correspondiente al estado despierto. La anestesia adecuada en las cirug\u00edas ordinarias est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ada para que el valor del \u00cdndice este comprendido entre 40 y 60. Todos los valores de la tabla son valores aproximados, basados en los valores medios del comportamiento del paciente. CSI Estado 90-100 Despierto 80-90 So\u00f1oliento 60-80 Ligera anestesio o sedaci\u00f3n 40-60 Anestesia quir\u00fargica 10-40 Anestesia profunda normalmente con BSr 0-10 Cerca del coma (BSr mayor que 75) Table 4 CSI description El \u00edndice de calidad de se\u00f1al (SQI) se recoge constante mente . Se calcula utilizando la calidad de la se\u00f1al del EEG adquirida pero teniendo en cuenta los artefactos de la se\u00f1al durante el minuto anterior y la impedancia del electrodo hasta la piel . El algoritmo de rechazo del artefacto asegura que el EEG no est\u00e1 contaminado por ruido externo (< 2\u00b5Vp -p, < 0.4\u00b5V RMS, 1 - 250 Hz). El SQI se mide como unidades porcentuales (0 -100%, siendo el 100% la mejor calidad de se\u00f1al). Una i mpedancia del electrodo hasta la piel de 1 k resulta en un SQI de 100. Si la impedancia de los sensores blanco o negro supera 1k, el SQI disminuir\u00e1 gradualmente. Si la impedancia del sensor es > 5k los valores del \u00edndice y la Electromiograf\u00eda dejaran de valorarse. En nuestro estudio, las impedancias se mantuvieron bajas (dentro de 1 k y k 3) utilizando una cera especial (Elefix, pasta para EEG, Nihon Kohden Corporation, Jap\u00f3n) entre los electrodos y la piel. 98 La actividad electromiogr\u00e1fica (EMG) elevada, de la musculatura facial puede interferir en el \u00edndice CSI, pero el monito r incorpora un filtro que elimina la mayor parte de las interferencias. 99 2.3. Evaluaci\u00f3n de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica basada en la utilizaci\u00f3n de los reflejos oculares. Una de las hip\u00f3tesis que hicimos en nuestro trabajo es que los reflejos oculares pod\u00edan relacionarse con el plano de anestesia. Las pruebas fueron reali zadas por el mismo anestesista en todos los perros. Los reflejos palpebrales y corn\u00e9ales se probaron tres veces con un hisopo humidificado en suero pa ra evitar lesiones en la c\u00f3rnea: E ste pro cedimiento se hizo siempre en el ojo derecho. El reflejo palpebral (PR) fue probado suavemente en el borde lat eral del ojo, y el reflejo corneal (CR) fue suscitado por una suave presi\u00f3n sobre la c\u00f3rnea. Los reflejos palpebral (PR) y corneal (CR) fueron clas ificados como presente (+) o ausente ( -). Tambi\u00e9n se observ\u00f3 la posici\u00f3n del globo ocular del paciente: Globo ocular girado ventromedial (ERV) si la pupila estaba mirando hacia la esquina del ojo, Centrado (CE) si la pupila se centr\u00f3 entre el p\u00e1rpado supe rior e inferior. Las r espuestas observadas se recogen en la siguiente tabla 5 Planos anest\u00e9sicos Reflejos oculares A PR+/EC/CR+ B PR+/ERV/CR+ rotated ventrally (ERV). In the presence of the reflex, it is symbolized as +, in its absence, it is symbolized as . 100 2.4 Protocolo anest\u00e9sico Empleamos tres protocolos diferentes. 2.4.1 Protocolo Anest\u00e9sico A Se analizaron quince perros sin raza, diez de los cuales fueron hembras, con una edad de 3.4\u00b12.4 a\u00f1os y un peso 22.5\u00b110.5 kg. Todos los perros fueron medicados previame nte con 0,5 mg Kg.-1 de sulfato de morfina (Morphine injection; Martindale Pharmaceuticals) IM (Vetoquinol \u00ae; Univete), treinta minutos antes del comienzo de la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia. La anestesia fue inducida median te una dosis 6 mg Kg.-1 de propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi \u00ae, Bad strada se eligio bas\u00e1ndonos en anteriores observaciones cl\u00ednicas (Ferreira, Ribeiro et al 2006). La administraci\u00f3n de propofol se hizo utilizand o una bomba de jeringa (Asena GH, Alaris Medical Systems) programada para permitir una velocidad de infusi\u00f3n m\u00e1xima de 600 ml h-1 La infusi\u00f3n de propofol ces\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de la administraci\u00f3n del bolo , momento en el que se deb\u00eda tener un valor m\u00ednimo del CSI. Seg\u00fan pasaba el tiempo deb\u00eda producirse una disminuci\u00f3n de PropCp por lo que ten\u00edamos un aumento en los valores del CSI. El estudio se terminaba cuando el \u00edndice alcanzaba un valor de 70. Durante el estudio todos los perros respiraban espont\u00e1neamente a tra v\u00e9s de una m\u00e1scara facial a traves de la qual se administraba ox\u00edgeno al 100%. Si en alg\u00fan caso se produ c\u00eda apnea, el estudio se i nterrump\u00eda y se descartaba ese animal para incluirlo en el estudio. Para poder realizar los procedimientos quir\u00fargicos planif icados se aumentaba la cantidad de propofol administrada, ya que los animales estaban pr\u00f3ximos a despertarse, pero estos valores no se contabilizaban en el estudio. 2.4.1 Protocolo Anestesico B Se estudiaron catorce perros sin raza, con 2.6\u00b10.9 a\u00f1os de edad, incluyendo 8 hembras, con un peso de 25.3\u00b15.28 kg. Los perros fueron medicados con 0,05 mgkg1 de acepromazina IM (Vetoquinol, Univete, Lure, Francia), treinta minutos antes del comienzo de la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia. 101 Durante la inducci\u00f3n de la an estesia, los perros pod\u00edan respirar espont\u00e1neamente a trav\u00e9s de una m\u00e1scara facial y se les suministraba ox\u00edgeno al 100%. La anestesia se realizo en dos estudios o protocolos : 2.4.1.1 Primer estudio En la primera fase del per\u00edodo de estudio, se administ r\u00f3 propofol en una infusi\u00f3n constante de 200 mlh1 . Los perros fueron colocados en dec\u00fabito esternal, y se evaluaron los primeros reflejos cuando los perros se cambiaron a una posici\u00f3n de dec\u00fabito lateral, cuando yo no hab\u00eda tono cervical Los reflejos pa lpebrales y corn\u00e9ales se observaron cada 30 segundos, anot\u00e1ndose tambi\u00e9n la posici\u00f3n del globo ocular. Las observaciones fueron realizad as por el mismo anestesista en todos los perros. El estudio fue detenido en caso de apnea ( el perro no respira durante m\u00e1s de 15 segundos), o hip otensi\u00f3n (presi\u00f3n arterial menor de 60 mm .Hg), o hasta la p\u00e9rdida del reflejo corneal. 2.4.1.1Segundo studio En la segunda fase, se administr\u00f3 propofol en diferentes concentraciones mediante el TCI (Target controlled infusions),con concentraciones de propofol en plasma de: 3 g/ml., 4 g /ml, 5 g /ml., 6g/ ml., 7 g /ml., 9 g / ml. y 11 g / ml. En cada nivel, la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de propofol se mantuvo inalterada durante 5 minutos. Los reflejos de los perros, pal pebrales y corn\u00e9ales, fueron evaluados por el mismo anestesi\u00f3logo. Cada reflejo fue probado en tres ocasiones y fue considerado negativo si no hubo respuesta las tres veces. El estudio se interrumpi\u00f3 si se produjo hipotensi\u00f3n (presi\u00f3n arterial menor de 60 mm Hg), o si el reflejo corneal se pierde. Los datos de los perros con hipotensi\u00f3n fueron descartados. Las variables hemodin\u00e1micas fueron controladas durante todo el estudio. 102 2.4 Estadisticas El ritmo card\u00edaco y presi\u00f3n arterial se midieron antes del i nicio de la infusi\u00f3n de propofol y comparados con los observados en PropCp mediante an\u00e1lisis de la varianza. Los resultados obtenidos de las pruebas de los reflejos fueron analizados y agrupados , en funci\u00f3n de las concentraciones de propofol y, consecuent emente, con profundidad anest\u00e9sica. Los datos fueron analizados mediante la prueba Shapiro Wilk. El an\u00e1lisis de correlaci\u00f3n de Spearman Rank se utilizo para comparar : CSI con PropCp ; CSI con planos anest\u00e9sicos y planos de anest\u00e9sicos con PropCp. La correla ci\u00f3n de rango de Spearman fue utilizada tambi\u00e9n para comparar planos anest\u00e9sicos con CSI (\u00cdndice de estado cerebral) y con EMG (electromiograf\u00eda) . En el \u00faltimo estudio, la relaci\u00f3n entre los plan os de anest\u00e9sicos y diferentes medidas de PropCp, se bas\u00f3 en una medida apropiada de rendimiento para identificar indicadores de profundidad anest\u00e9sica, la probabilidad de predicci\u00f3n (PK) (Smith, Dutton et al. 1996) Un valor de PK de 1 significa que los valores de la variable de predicci\u00f3n, por ejemplo, el indicador de profundidad anest\u00e9sica predice correctamente el valor de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica observado. Un valor de PK de 0,5 significa que los valores del indicad or solo predicen una probabilidad de 50 -50. La frecuencia card\u00edaca, presi\u00f3n arterial media y los d atos obtenidos con el \"Cerebral State Monitor\" (CSI, BS, SQI y EMG) se compararon con los valores de referencia (obtenidos veinte minutos despu\u00e9s de la administraci\u00f3n de acepromazina, que se necesitaba para poder aplicar los electrodos), mediante las prue bas de t de muestras pareadas o Wilcoxon. El an\u00e1lisis estad\u00edstico se realiz\u00f3 mediante SPSS v. 13.0 para Windows. 103 Chaper 3 Results 3.1 Section One Brain monitoring in dogs using the cerebral state index during the induction of anesthesia via target Portugal b CECAV, Universidade de Tra\u00e1s -os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal c Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas Abel Salazar da Universidade do Porto; Hospital Geral de Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Servi\u00e7o de Anestesiologia, Porto, Portugal; d Division of Engineering, Kings College London, London, UK 3.1.1 Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the Cerebral State Index (CSI) and the estimated propofol plasma concentrations in based on the pharmacokinetic model for propofol, was used to control the syringe pump and to estimate plasma propofol concentrations (PropC p) and the CSI values every five seconds. Three electrodes placed in the centre of the forehead, on the left side of the forehead and on left used to collect the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal converted by the Cerebral State Monitor into the CSI. The cerebral electrical changes induced by increasing propofol concentrations appear to CSI monitoring in dogs. The negative correlation between CSI and 104 PropCp demonstrates that the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in dogs during of anesthetic and sedative agents on the Central Nervous System remains a challenge (Flaishon R 1 997). Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) is an anesthesia (Guarracino, et al. 2005) veterinary medicine, have been published using in dogs during anesthesia et al. 2001; Musk, Pang et al. , which state that TCI is an appropriate technique for use in dogs. TCI minimising (Musk, et al. 2005) and allows a more effective and easy control of the depth of anesthesia (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . In human medicine, a variety of analytical concepts have been proposed widely used for this purpose is the bispectral index (BIS), which is largely based on the bispectrum analysis of the EEG (Stanski 2000) . On the other hand, the Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) was recently introduced as an intra -operative monitor of anesthetic depth (Zhong, Guo et al. 2005) . The Cerebral State Index (CSI) provided by CSM monitors is based on a combination of four sub parameters of the e lectroencephalographic signal. Three of these derive from spectral analysis of the EEG, and the fourth is the burst suppression (BS) calculated by the CSM (Jensen, Litvan . CSI the EEG electrical activity of a fully awake individual. CSI is based on the analysis of the EEG frequency using a ideal anesthetic level for humans was established to be between 40 an d 60 (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . In veterinary medicine, BIS monitoring has been proposed as a way to assess dept h of anesthesia dogs (Muir 2003) (March and Muir 2003) and pigs (Martin -Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) . However its applicability is not clear when it between species and drugs. Furthermore the correlation between EEG depression and the BIS index is unclear (March and Muir 2005) . In showed reduction values, it was not possible to establish a BIS interval where it is safe to maintain anesthesia (Lamont, Greene et al. 2005; March and Muir 2005) The CSM may be a useful monitor to access depth of anesthesia in veterinary medicine. This monitor provides a similar brain monitoring function to that of the BIS. The CSM's small size and low cost when compared to other brain monitors makes it an anesthetic procedures. The CSM monitor has not been studied to the same extent as the BIS. In v eterinary anesthesia , the CSM monitor has only knowledge, no stud ies have been published involving the use of CSI on The CSM estimate CSI is different from that used by the BIS monitor. The CSM uses a fuzzy logic analysis tool which is not specifically adjusted to use on humans. On the contrary, the calculations use data during procedures. The objective of this study is to correlation between CSI and propofol -estimated plasma kg-1 morphine IM (Vetoquinol\u00ae; Univete), thirty minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anesthesia .

The EEG waveform was derived from the signal recorded between the (w hite) and mastoid (black) electrodes. frequency Hz. (Danmeter 2004) . Impedances were kept a t a low level (within 1 k and 3 k ) by placing and the skin. 108 The CSI is based on analysis of the frequency content of the EEG signal. The EEG energy is characterised into specific frequency bands. These are used to define two energy ratios, namely alpha ( ) and beta ( ). There is a shift exhibited in the energy content of both and , from a relatively high to a relatively low frequency level, when the animal is in a deeper state of anesthesia . The relationship between these shifts also analysed by CSM as a separate parameter ( -). The monitor, that works online, also amount of instantaneous BS during each period of the EEG in order to quantify the a mount of time the EEG is \"silent\" very complex processes t be carried can also be successfully applied (SQI) was collected at a rate.

When excessive noise is detected, the signal was induced a of 1% (Fresenius programmed to allow of 600 ml h-1. A propofol bolus 50 seconds after propofol administration et al. 2006) Belgium)), running on a 109 personal computer, was used to drive the propofol syringe pump. The pharmacokinetic model for propofol from Beths and colleagues (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) was incorporated in the RugLoop II\u00ae software and was was ceased after the bolus administration. At this point the CSI was expected to have attained its minimum value. Then, with a in resulting increase in the CSI values was expected. In order to avoid a total recovery from the anesthes ia, the study methodology limited the recovery to a CSI value of 70. Once the CSI reached 70, the study ended; the depth of During dogs were allowed to b reathe spontaneously via a facial mask administering 100% oxygen. If apnea were to occur, the study would be the dogs intubated and mechanically ventilated and subsequently discarded from the final data analysis. No stimuli were applied at any time. 3.1.3.4 -Statistical analysis. Data was tested for normal distribution and for homogeneity of variance using Shapiro at PropCp using analysis of variance.

There fore, the location chosen by us to place the electrodes was the same as that referred to by Grenne, Benson and colleagues (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) and described by Pellegrino and Sica as suitable for EEG re cording (Pellegrino and Sica 2004) . Prior to induction of anesthesia , CSI values were 90.7\u00b14 in the dogs used in our study. In humans, CSI values between 90 -100 represent the electrical brain activity of an awake individual while CSI values between 80 to 90 indicate a low level of sedation (Danmeter 2004) . of 2000) may explain the CSI values observed in dogs at the outset of our study. Nolan and Reid suggested that tracheal intubation should not be performed maximum in 2). in taken to attain the maximum PropCp and CSI response may be justified by the large weight variability among the dogs used and by the maximum infusion rate of 600 ml h-1 permitted by When increased, a time lag occurs plasma effect site is reached (Jacobs 1995) . The time needed to transfer the drug to the effect site (the brain in the case of hypnotics) depends on the concentration 115 gradient, and an requires less time . Beths' Glen et al. 2001) was developed using dogs with a wide range of ages with improved control of (Beths, fewer unwante side effects (Musk, Pang values higher than 30% were observed in seven dogs at maximum PropCp and in five dogs at minimum CSI values. EMG is EMG with r apid changes in BIS values in dogs (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . Despite the fact that CSI value (Jensen, Litvan et al. . However, there are published studies that quantify the total influence of EMG on CSI. Low EMG values are ideal when monitoring brain activity. One way this would be the administration myorelaxant drugs. monitoring the SQI, signal -minute period. by the level of impedance of the electrodes on the skin. Impedance of the black and white sensors above a period, impedance was kept low (within 1 k and 3 k ) with the use of wax placed between electrodes and skin, thus allowing us to obtain average SQI values of around 80% over the course of the study period. The CSI could be a satisfactory alternative to BIS for monitoring depth of anesthesia in (Hoymork, The demonstrates more variability in the 116 baseline when compared with BIS. However, both have a of studies reporting on monitoring depth of anesthesia using monitor to have limitations when used in burst suppression observed after the administration of large doses of anesthetic s (March and Muir 2005) . In these BIS' to be limited when monitoring the degree of CNS depression (Greene, Benson et al. 2004; Martin -Cancho, Lima BIS interval for anaesthetising veterinary Greene al.

This reflected by progressive (Zhong, Guo et al. 2005) , this is the first time that it has been reported in dogs. Propofol decreases the arterial (mean arterial pressure <60mmHg) were observed in only two dogs in our study for a very brief period of time when PropCp reached its maximum concentration. Other than these two cases, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were always within dogs during induction of anesthesia . The negative correlation between CSI and PropCp indicates that the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in must be underlined that CSM is a brain monitor not yet validated for use in veterinary anesthesia 117 and, this must therefore be taken into account. Nevertheless, this study shows that CSI monitoring could be a potentially useful tool for accessing the depth of anesthesia in 118 3.2-Section Two Correlation between clinical signs of depth of anesthesia and cerebral state index responses in dogs during induction CECAV, Hospital Veterin\u00e1 Porto, Portugal b CECAV, Unive rsidade de Tr \u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal c Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas Abel Salazar da Universidade do Porto; Hospital Geral de Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Servi\u00e7o de Anestesiologia, Porto, Portugal; d Division of Engineering, Kings College London, London, UK 3.2.1 -Absctract The Cerebral State Index (CSI) is used EEG and depth of anesthesia . of study was to analyse the correlation between ocular reflexes, CSI and estima ted propofol plasma concentrations (PropCP) in dogs during induction were acepromazine 0.05mg kg -1 IM.

The CSI monitoring was not consistent with the clinical observations observed in different stages of depth anesthesia . This could limit the use of CSI monitoring depth of anesthesia with propofol. 120 3.2.2 -Introduction plane of (Pomfrett respiratory stage of anesthesia (Heiko 2004) . So far, only ether was used the clinical stages according to anesthetic depth (Bhargava, Setlur et al. 2004) The development of a brain monitor that can be used in dogs is a real necessity to monitor depth of anesthesia more objectively. provides a direct measurement of the functional state brain which makes the monitoring statistically (Miller, Sleig et be introduced in EEG monitoring used to access the depth of anesthesia . The Cerebral State Monitor (CSM), et al. 2006; Hoymork, Hval et al. 2007) This monitor has not yet been validated in dogs but there is a possibility that the Cerebral State Index (CSI) displayed by the CSM could be used for EEG monitoring in dogs (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2007) . The objective of this study is to analyse the correlation between depth of anesthesia by and propofol concentrations in dogs during induction premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 Acepromazine IM (Calmivet\u00ae, Vetoquinol, France), thirty minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anesthesia .

The EEG waveform in our study was derived from the signal recorded between the frontopolar electrode (positive)represented by the white color and the occipital electrode (negative) represented by t he black color, according to Pelegrino and colleagues' studies (Pellegrino and Sica 2004) . The ground or the reference electrode was placed in the parietal position.

Impedances were kept low (within 1 k and 3 k ) by using a special wax (Elefix, Kohden Corporation) placed between the electrodes and the skin. 123 The CSI is calculated using four sub -parameters of the electroencephalogram: ratio, ratio, ratio - ratio, and burst suppression. These sub -parameters are used to define two energ y ratios called alpha ( ) and beta ( ). Both and show a shift in the energy content from the higher to the lower frequencies with deeper anesthesia . This information can be used to achieve an index which varies from 0 to 100 (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) using the quality of the EEG and on t he signal artefacts during the previous one minute period. The electrode at 1 k result in a SQI of 100. If the impedance of the white or 04). If the sensor impedance is >5k the CSI, BS and EMG running on a personal computer was used to drive the propofol syringe pump.

Anesthesia was induced using a constant infusion rate of propofol 1% (Fresenius Kabi\u00ae; Bad Homburg, Germany). Throughout this period, the animals were breathing 100% oxygen through a face mask. The end point of the propofol administration was the moment when the dogs lost their corneal reflex. However if the dogs became apnoeic (did not eathe for more than 15 seconds) or hypotensive (meaning arterial blood pressure propofol 124 administration was stopped . After the end of the study the dog was intubated and prepared for the scheduled surgery. No stimuli wer e applied at any time the dogs other than testing reflexes. 3.2.3.4 -Clinical observation of the depth Before the induction of anesthesia and after premedication, the dogs were placed in sternal recumbency. The first reflexes were tested when the dogs changed to a lateral recumbence without a cervical tonus after the beginning of the propofol infusion. The palpebral and corneal reflexes wer e moistened with serum. The palpebral reflex was tested gently the lateral canthus of the eye, and corneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the cornea. Each reflex was tested three times and considered ne gative if there was no response to the three taps with the swab. The eyeball or absent ( -); the position of the eyeball was as eyeball rotated ventormedially (ERV) if the pupil was looking towards the middle eye corner, or centred (EC) if the pupil was centred between the superior and inferior palpebral. The tests were performed by the same operator for all of the dogs 3.2.3. 5-Data and statistical analysis The results obtained from testing the different plane of anesthesia was given to each group of reflexes. Data was tested for distribution using the Shapiro Wilk test. Heart rate, mean CSI values were analyzed used to compare CSI and PropCp, CSI and anesthetic planes, and anesthetic planes and PropCp. A delay of 50 seconds in CSI data was taken into account when analyzing CSI data (Pilge, Zanner . Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.13.0 Data was reflexes 8 ). CSI decreased f rom baseline to plane (table 9 ) but no significant correlation was observed and these anesthetic planes 3.2.4.1 planes (R=0.887; P<0.01 ). In plane E, all dogs lost their corneal reflex, and were intubated with At this time point lower EMG values associated with lower CSI values wer e observed.

Five different anesthetic planes based on the analysis of ocular reflexes were and so, different PropCp intervals are proposed to achieve a desired of anesthesia CSI with increasing propofol concentrations but there was no correlation between CSI and the depth of anesthesia provided by the anesthetic planes in this Thus, CSI does not seem to provide trustworthy clinical monitoring the anesthesia propofol. The hemodynamic parameters monitored in this study provided very information depth of anesthesia propofol arterial pressure decreased by about 16% from baseline to plane E, which is of limited clinical use whe n monitoring depth of anesthesia . of three -compartment pharmacokinetic model for propofol for dogs (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) allowed the use of TCI in veterinary anesthesia obtained with the constant were based on Beths acokinetic model (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . Although in our study no blood analyses were performed to measure the real propofol concentration are studies showing that TCI using this pharmacokinetic with improved control of less effects (Musk, Pang et al. 2005) t o manual infusion. The effects of doses of propofol increases the amplitude and the EEG alpha wave rhythm, followed by a shift to EEG gamma and theta frequency. (Jensen, depth. The most studied monitor in veterinary science is the bispectral index monitor BIS (March and Muir 2005) . This monitor seems to have some limitations used in animals, especially when burst suppression is observed after the administration of large anesthetic doses 130 (March and Muir 2005) . In these studies, the hypnotic agen ts were essentially halogenated and the results showed limited BIS usefulness for monitoring the degree of Central Nervous System (CNS) depression (Greene, Benson et al. 2004; Martin - Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) . Increased concentrations of anestheti c agents accurately estimate it is safe veterinary patients (Lamont, et . For BIS values even during a steady state of anesthesia (Greene, Benson et al. 2004) . In humans, CSI monitoring has recently been introduced with BIS. both . Jensen colleagues concluded that the CSI could be a reasonable alternative to the BIS monitor. In a previous study, our group proposed the CSI as a possible satisfactory alternative to BIS for monitoring depth of anesthesia in dogs (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2007) . This study showed that the cerebral electrical changes induced by a 6 mg kg-1 bolus dose of was detected by dogs during induction of anesthesia . The negative correlation between CSI and PropCp suggested that the CSI could be used to assess electrical brain activity in dogs. However, results is lower than the previous study (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2007) . A possible reason for such differences may be related to the time needed to transfer the drug to the effect site. The concentration at the brain in the case of hypnotics depends on the con centration gradient (Musk, Pang et al. 2005 ). When a bolus of 6 mg kg-1 of propofol is administered, the time lag needed and -site concentrations reflects the propofol concentrations in the brain by showing lo wer CSI values. In a constant rate gradient of of propofol between the plasma and the effect -site is lower, and the time to transfer the drug to the effe ct site is longer. Furthermore, this study showed a ml-1). This may be than 90 indicate brain, between 80 to 70 indicate deep sedation, between 60 and 40 indicate excessive . we can see in table 2, the CSI values are far from correlating with these intervals. Furthermore CSI had no correlation with propofol -estimated plasma concentrations and no correlat ion with the clinical signs of the anesthetic planes referred in this study. It is known that EMG activity is the most significant source value Litvan et al. 2006) . The influence of EMG in dogs may be particularly important due to the amount of muscles in the head compared with humans. attempt the mid -line. The influenc e of EMG on the CSI values was a constant observation in our study and it seems to be the main reason for the high standard deviation observed in the CSI values during the with a surgical plane of anesthesia (stage III, planes 2 and 3) (March and Muir 2005) . In our study, the BS was observed in three out of the four dogs that had values of CSI below 40 and happened more consistently in plane E of anesthesia where all dogs lost their corneal reflex. Another important parameter to take into The of SQI of the impedance of the electrodes in the skin. Impedances of the black and white electrodes superior to period, impedances were kept low (within 1 k and 3 k ) by using wax placed between electrodes and the skin. Propofol decrease s the arterial blood pressure by central depression of sympathetic neural output, which results . in sheep show that rapid injection of 132 propofol for the induction of anesthesia produces effects on cardiovascular systems than a slower infusion rate (Zheng, Upton et al. 1998) . In our study, no hypotensive episodes were observed and mean arterial blood pressure showed an average maximum decrease of from \"awake\" values the rate propofol infusion (a constant infusion of 200 ml min-1) and the dogs' weight of over 20 kg may help to explain the hemodynamic stability. In conclusion, of with propofol. The CSM was not consistent with the clinical observations on the different planes of depth of anesthesia . This may limit monito depth of anesthesia and cerebral state index responses in dogs with different target -controlled Veterin\u00e1 Porto, Porto, Portugal b CECAV, Universidade de Tr \u00e1s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Vila Real, Portugal c Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria,Universidad L\u00e9on, Departamento de To evaluate if the Cerebral State Index (CSI), measured by a Cerebral State Monitor (CSM), can study.

PropCp 3 \u00b5g dL- 1 was set initially, then s were i ncreased in 1 \u00b5g dl-1 steps 7, 11 \u00b5g dL-1. Each PropCp was held constant for a 5 minute period, at the end of which depth of anesthesia was classified using palpebral and corneal reflexs and eye position. Cerebral state index (CSI), burst suppression (BSR) and electromyogram were measured at these time points. The 134 Prediction Probability (PK) of these variables, or of State Monitor was able to detect very deep planes of anesthesia when BSR occurs, but was not able to distinguish between the planes the state of the cerebral cortex al. and Takeda Gajraj, Doi et al. 1998) and in animals (Antunes et al. 2003; Otto 2008) the analysis of the EEG with methods based on power spectrum anesthesia to provide a scale of hypnosis. In veterinary medicine, the efficacy of BIS monitoring in the depth of anesthesia , cats (March and Muir 2003) and pigs (Martin - Cancho, Lima et al. 2006) has been studied, but in animals the correlation between EEG depression and the BIS index is unclear, especially when burst suppression is observed after anesth doses (March and Muir 2005) . This may reflect the fac t that \"BIS' calculations species. The Cerebral State Monitor (CSM) is a fuzzy logic based analysis from the EEG monitor and has been used monitoring the The main advantage of this method is that because the relationship between the EEG and the clinical state cannot be eas ily modeled by a mathematical function, the fuzzy logic analysis has the potential to offer a better alternative to establish this relationship (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . In a previous study carried out in our laboratory (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2008) an intravenous (IV) propofol bolus of 6 mg kg-1 resulted in progressive decrease in Cerebral State Index (CSI) values displayed by the CSM, and a slight negative correlation between the plasma target concentration (PropCp) and CSI was observed. This suggested could of anesthesia in dogs. However, in a subsequent in which propofol was given by a continuous infusion of to induce anesthesia to varying clinical depths, t he CSI was not of the depth of anesthesia (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . The objective of this current study is to evaluate correlation ethics and fully informed consent for data collection, for altering the planes of anesthesia and for enrolment in research given induction of anesthesia with propofol in 14 dogs (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . This current report is of the continuation of anesthesia with propofol in these subjects. All dogs and blood analysis (packed cell volume, total protein and blood urea). All dogs were premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 acepromazine IM (Calmivet\u00ae, Vetoquinol, Fra nce) 30 minutes prior to the beginning of the induction of anesthesia . A cannula (18 gauge ) administration. A three way stopcock was used to connect the IV catheter to the propofol and sodium chloride 0. 9% delivery lines. Sodium chloride a rate hour-1 was administered during study measured region are reported. Cuff width was chosen to be around 40% of circumference of the limb . Three measurements were obtained and used to calculate same as that employed in the previous stud ies (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2008) . The electrodes were already in position for the induction of anesthesia (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) and were left in place. The bipolar EEG waveform in our study was derived from the signal recorded between the frontopolar electrode (positive), 138 and the occipital electrode (negative), as described by (Pellegrino and Sica 2004) . The ground or the reference electrode was placed cable CSM cable, was used to provide these electrodes. Before the application of clamp electrodes the skin was cleaned with alcohol 5 minutes before the data collection to allow drying. The CSM displ SQI. of how these parameters are derived has been described fully in our previous work (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . CSI is based on a combination of four sub -parameters of the electroencephalographic signal: ratio, ratio, - ratio and burst suppression (BS). T he CSI is displayed in a scale from 0 to 100 that represents the different depths of anesthesia . The BS is defined as the percentage of time in a 30 -second window where the amplitude of the of on the signal artefacts previous 1 -minute period. included in the facial muscular or electromyographic can interfere with the monitor incorporates EMG The EMG bar shows the energy of the EMG level in the 75 -85 Hz frequency band (0 -100 logarithmic scale).

The pharmacokinetic model incorporated in the RugLoop II software and used to estimate the propofol plasma concentrations was that of Beths et al. (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . RugLoop II was also used to store the pharmacokinetic, hemodynamic and electroencephalographic data every 5 seconds. Thirty minutes premedication, anesthesia was induced with propofol mL hour-1 until of anesthesia were during this induction as previously described (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . Once this previous study was compl eted, the trachea was intubated and the dogs were mechanically ventilated with 100% oxygen in order to maintain the end -tidal CO 2 between 35 - 45mmHg (4.6 -6 kPa). All dogs were positioned in left lateral recumbency during the entire study period. he propofol target control infusion (TCI) was then initialize d by switching the infusion mode in the RugloopII from CRI to PropCp . An initial plasma target of 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was set. It required (mean \u00b1 SD) 9.5 \u00b1 2.4 minutes for the initial high plasma concentrations of the Rugloop II infusion and when the estimated correct value was reached, the pump was automatically re -started and the plasma target of 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was maintained for 5 minutes. At the end of this 5- minute period , reflex testing to assess testing was as described in our previous study (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . The palpebral and corneal reflexes of the right eye were tested three times with a swab damped with serum. The reflexes were considered negative if there were no response to these three stimulations. The palpebral reflex was tested gently at the lateral canthus of the eye, and the corneal reflex was elicited by a smooth pressure on the cornea. The eyeball position was observed. The ocular reflexes were grouped in 'planes' of depth, A to E as described previously (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) and in table 10 . Once the reflexes had were 9 each increase. same procedure s were applied for evaluating the reflexes at the end of each 5 minute step. If mean arterial blood pressure decreased below 60 mmHg, the propofol administration was stopped. After the end of the study a TCI of 3 \u00b5g dL-1 was set and a kg-1 was administered end of the surgery carprofen 4 mg kg-1 SC and a single dose morphine 0.4 mg kg-1 SC were administered. 3.3.3.4 and as described by Smith et al (Smith, Dutton et al. 1996) . A PK value of 1 means that of the indicator predict no better than a 50 -50 chance. The PK calculation was performed the program PKMACRO. eart rate, mean arterial pressure and CSM da ta (CSI, SQI and EMG) are and 95th percentiles, The t ime delays for the CSI calculation ranged from 53 to 55 seconds (Pilge, Zanner et al. 2006 ). In our analysis, a delay of 50 seconds in CSI data was taken into account when analyzing CSI data . 141 3.3.4 -Results The subjects were 14 dogs, of mixed breeds, 8 females and 6 males, aged 2.6 \u00b1 1 years, and weight 24.5 \u00b1 4.67 kg. One dog was exclude d from data analysis because it showed an anomalous EEG flat line throughout the whole study period. Two dogs required initial PropCp doses of of anesthesia in one dog did not reach anesthetic plane E even at 11 \u00b5g dL-1. The plane of anesthesia (as defined by 0) increased with administration of increasing PropCp , but the five separate planes were not observed in all dogs. In most such cases d epth of anesthesia increased, missing a plane (eg. from C to E). However, in one dog the plane decreased from D to C despite an increased PropCp . The hemodynamic the identified anesthetic plane are shown in Table 11 . The results demonstrate that CSI distinguished plane C and E from the baseline (awake). Only four dogs passed through plane D which impaired the analysis. EMG decreased with the depth of anesthesia , and parameters planes were at intermediate values in the region of 0.75. Thus the monitor did not always predict increases or of 0.71. At deep levels of anesthesia the CSI was sensitive to burst suppression, 12 dogs reached the plane E and eight of them showed burst suppression (BS) the percentage BS duri ng plane was on average 11%. Burst suppression was also observed in planes C and D in two dogs with low values, less than 3%.

Data are presented as boxes' Overlap between CSI CSI and four subparameters derived from the time domain analysis domain analysis ( an index these subparameters are used as inputs to a fuzzy logic analysis. Fuzzy logic is a problem -solving methodology that incorporates a X al. 2006) . In points without interfering with the collection of the EEG signal. In our previous study we identified a scale of anesthetic depth based on ocular reflexes (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . In this earlier study in which propofol was infused at a constant rate to induce anesthesia and then to increase depth to the planes of anesthesia identified in the results with the CSM as, anesthetic planes accurately. As it is possible that this failure was because a steady state propofol concentration had not been reached at the effector cells, the objec tive of this current continuation study was to re -evaluate the CSM performance, this time during maintenance of anesthesia with propofol with different target concentrations. A monitor of depth anesthesia can only be called accurate if it (1) provides an a ccurate correlation with cerebral drug concentration, (2) correlates with the state of (3) informs the excessive levels are present (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . In our study, these three aspects were analyzed. The first condition for CSM was not met as the PK value was 0.65 which means that the monitor did not always predict increments or decrements in the amount of propofol. The analysis was carried out 5 minutes after propofol was anticipated to have reached the selected plasma target co ncentration. At the end of each propofol stage, it was assumed that the PropCp was similar to the propofol concentration at the effect site This 145 assumption was based on the half -life for the propofol plasma -effect et al. et al studies with TCI allowed three minutes for the equilibration between blood and drug site action (Musk, Pang et al. 2005) . A potential reason for the poor correlation between CSI and PropCp in this study compared with the previous work (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) is that a different method of statistical analysis was employed. A further reason could be the application of Beths' pharmacokinetic model (Beths et al. 200 1). The model is derived from a population sample of dogs, with its inevitable variations between real and target plasma concentrations of propofol. In humans a 20 -30% variation between real and target propofol plasma concentration can be acceptable clinic ally for TCI use (Coetzee, Glen et al. 1995; Fechner, Albrecht et al. 1998) . However, the Prop Cp based on Beths' pharmacokinetic model could be even more variable as a result of the great breed variability in the dog population. It important to refer that in the Beth`s model the performance of the TCI was evaluated with the administration of an opi oid and in present study the acepromazine alone was used for premedication (Beths, Glen et al. 2001) . In our study no analyses were performed to measure the real propofol concentration in the blood. Regarding the second condition, the present study showed that the sequential increase of the anesthetic depth from plane A to E was followed by a decrease in CSI values, but the CSI did not distinguish accurately between the anesthetic planes B, C and D as the CSI values were overlapped. Although CSI et al. 2006) EMG in dogs may be particularly important due to the amou nt of muscles in the head compared with humans. The influence of EMG on the CSI values was a constant observation in our study and could be another reason for the low values obtain for PK. E. Some studies in humans also suggest that the CSI has a better performance in detecting deep levels of Benson al. 2002) . In dogs, an increase in suppression ratio could lead paradoxical 2005) . Nevertheless, this was not observed in in which burst suppression was observed frequently during plane E the lowest CSI values. During burst suppression, the and ratio a function of anesthetic cannot be the calculation of the final index (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006) . The hemodynamic parameters were monitored in this study to ensure that the dogs were not harmed by the increasing depth of anesthesia . . It is known that propofol decreases the arterial lood pressure by central depression of sympathetic neural output, which showed a surprisingly stable hemodynamic profile, the maximum decrease of MAP being 24% from baseline i n plane E. This hemodynamic stability when propofol is infused may limit data for monitoring depth of anesthesia and strengthen the need for a EEG based monitor for veterinary use, but in this current study no painful stimuli were administered so the cardiovascular response to surgery was not investigated. In conclusion, this study evaluates the use of the in detecting depth five anesthetic planes (Ribeiro, Ferreira et al. 2009) . Although there is some prediction probability between CSI anesthetic planes, the showed clinically important as it was not able to distinguish between anesthetic planes B, C, and D (ie those depths likely to be used in clinical practice), as CSI of anesthesia , and this fact could be relevant for the use of Fuzzy logic analysis in future monitors. 147 Chap ter 4 4.1-Global summary of results In general the results from this thesis point for limited capacity of the monitor accurately seems a useful tool in the future to assess the performance of brain EEG based different ways to evaluate the performance of the CSM monitor under different protocols for propofol administration. Furthermore, during induction anesthesia with a propofol bolus of 6mgKg-1 a of In propofol w as used to achieved the anesthetic correlation was between CSI and PropCp (R=0,47).In the third study, during maintenance of anesthesia with different target controlled infusions of propofol, the PK CSI and 0,65. All these results represent a poor the and drug concentration. 4.1.2 CSI relation with for developing the objective clinical scale to monitor depth of anesthesia in dogs general anesthesia with propofol, and to evaluate the CSM monitor performance in the subsequen t studies. 148 In the second study, during induction anesthesia with propofol 200ml/h, no planes despite the CSI decreases from baseline to anesthetic planes . This means that the monitor did not always predict increments or decrements in the level of anesthesia of anesthesia . The detection of the deep level s of anesthesia and burst suppression is one of the biggest virtues of the CSM monitor when applied to dogs. In the first study only three dogs present burst suppression, related with the lower values of CSI. In the second study, i n plane E, all dogs lost their palpebral and corneal reflex, and were intubated with At this time point lower EMG values associated with lower CSI values were observed. With the exception of one dog that have burst suppression in plane C and D, the BSR was only observed in plane E. In the third study t he highest value observed for d to 0,71. At deep levels of anesthesia the CSI was sensitive to burst suppres sion: twelve dogs reached detected the excessive of anesthesia in eight of them , by revealing an average of 11% . Burst suppression was also observed in Planes C and D in two dogs with BS values less than 3%. The influence of the EMG in CSI values was a constant finding during all studies, and it seems to be the main reason for the high standard deviation observed in the CSI values during the anesthetic planes C, D and E . In the first study EMG values higher than 30% were observed in seven dogs at maximum PropCp , and in five dogs at minimum CSI values . In the third study was interesting verify decreases (R=0,80) . Hemodynamic variables were not a and did not influence the studies of anesthetic depth. In the first study t here was a 13% decrease in mean arterial pressure (P<0.05 ) rate ( between awake values recorded at maximum PropCp . In the second study m ean arterial blood pressure decreased by 16 % from the baseline to plane E ( P<0.05 ). Heart rate did not change significantly during the study . In the third study m ean arterial blood press ure and heart rate did not change significantly , with the exception for MAP in plane C were the difference was minimum threshold value of 60 mmH g in any study, which could have compromised the cerebral autoregulation and influence the results 150 Cap\u00edtulo 4 4.1.Resumen global de los resultados Los resultados obtenidos por nosotros muestran que la capacidad del monitor CSM es muy limitada cuando queremos determinar con precisi\u00f3n diferentes planos anest\u00e9sicos y que adem\u00e1s nos los relacione con los signos cl\u00ednicos observados cuando utilizamos diferentes concentraciones de propofol en la anestesia de perros. Aunque el CSI se muestra efectivo en el p lano m\u00e1s profundo de la anestesia (plano E), cuando se produce la BS, este plano anest\u00e9sico no se alcanza normalmente en las anestesias que hacemos en la cl\u00ednica diaria. Los resultados concretos de esta memoria podemos agruparlos en los apartados siguientes: 4.1.1 - Respuesta del CSI a la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica previsible de propofol. En el primer estudio durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia con un bolo de propofol de 6mgKg-1 se observ\u00f3 una correlaci\u00f3n negativa significativa entre CSI y PropCp (coeficiente de correlaci\u00f3n de -0.57; P < 0,01). En el segundo estudio cuando se utilizo una infusi\u00f3n de propofol de 200 ml-1 para alcanzar los planos anest\u00e9sicos deseados, no se observ\u00f3 ninguna correlaci\u00f3n entre CSI y PropCp (R = 0, 47). En el tercer estud io, durante el mantenimiento de la anestesia con infusiones de distintas concentraciones de propofol, el PK fue 0,65 cuando se estudio la relaci\u00f3n del CSI con PropCp. Todos estos resultados representan una baja correlaci\u00f3n entre la CSI y la concentraci\u00f3n estimada de propofol. 151 4.1.2 - Relaci\u00f3n de CSI con los reflexos oculares observados en los perros . Lo primero fue establecer una escala visual de los reflejos oculares para relacionarlos con los cinco planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica (A, B, C, D, E), cuan do anestesi\u00e1bamos a perros con propofol. En el segundo estudio, durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia con propofol 200 ml/h, no se observ\u00f3 ninguna correlaci\u00f3n significativa entre CSI y planos anest\u00e9sicos a pesar de las disminuciones CSI desde el plano A has ta al plano E. Sin embargo, se observ\u00f3 una fuerte correlaci\u00f3n, o probabilidad de predicci\u00f3n entre planos anest\u00e9sicos de la escala cl\u00ednica y la PropCp (R = 0.887; P < 0,01). En el tercer estudio, la PK entre PropCp y los planos de anest\u00e9sicos fue alta (PK = 0, 78). El uso de PK mostr\u00f3 valores cercanos al 0,75 cuando estudiamos la relaci\u00f3n entre CSI con planos de anest\u00e9sicos. Esto significa que el monitor no siempre es capaz de indicarnos incrementos o disminuciones del nivel de anestesia. 4.1.3 - Evaluaci\u00f3 n de desempe\u00f1o de monitor CSM en la anestesia profunda . La detecci\u00f3n de niveles de anestesia y la BSR es una de las mayores virtudes del monitor CSM cuando se aplica a los perros. En el primer estudio s\u00f3lo tres perros presentan BSR, relacionada con los v alores inferiores de CSI. En el segundo estudio, en el plano E, todos los perros pierden su reflejo palpebral y corneal y fueron intubados con reflejo lar\u00edngeo ausente. En esta fase los valores EMG m\u00e1s bajos est\u00e1n asociados con los valores m\u00e1s bajos de CSI . Con la excepci\u00f3n de un perro que presentaba BSR en los planos C y D, el BSR s\u00f3lo se observ\u00f3 en el plano E en los dem\u00e1s perros. En el tercer estudio el valor m\u00e1s alto observado de PK (PK = 0,91) fue para BSR relacionados con los planos anest\u00e9sicos. Cuando BSR se analiz\u00f3 relacionado lo con la PropCp, el PK disminuy\u00f3 a 0,71. En niveles de anestesia profundos el CSI es sensible a la BSR . Doce perros alcanzaron el plano E, y el CSM (Cerebral State Monitor ) detect o la excesiva profundidad de 152 anestesia en ocho de ellos, presentando un promedio del 11% BS. La BS tambi\u00e9n se observ\u00f3 en los planos C y D en dos perros con valores inferiores a 3%. La influencia del EMG en los valores de CSI fue una constante en todos los estudios, asi el primer estudio se obser varon valores de EMG superiores al 30 % en siete perros en PropCp m\u00e1ximo y en cinco perros en valores m\u00ednimos de CSI. En el tercer estudio fue interesante comprobar que el EM G disminuye con el incremento de la profundidad de la anestesia y mostro una alta correlaci\u00f3n con el CSI (R = 0, 80). Las variables hemodin\u00e1micos no eran objeto prioritario de estudio en estos trabajos y los resultados obtenidos confirman que las variables hemodin\u00e1micas no estaban relacionadas con la profundidad anest\u00e9sica. En el prime r estudio, hubo una disminuci\u00f3n de 13% en la presi\u00f3n arterial media (P < 0,05) y un aumento de 17% en la frecuencia cardiaca (P < 0,05) cuando se compraban los valores medidos en los animales despiertos y los valores registrados en PropCp m\u00e1xima. En el seg undo estudio la presi\u00f3n arterial media disminu\u00eda un 16% cuando se comparaban los valores obtenidos cuando el a nimal estaba sin anestesia con los obtenidos cuando el animal estaba en el plano E (P < 0,05). La frecuencia card\u00edaca no cambi\u00f3 significativamente durante el estudio. En la tercer estudio la presi\u00f3n arterial y ritmo card\u00edaco no cambiaron significativamente en los diferentes planos de anestesia., con la excepci\u00f3n de la presi\u00f3n arterial media en el plano de anestesia C, con una diferencia fue significativa (P < 0,05) resp ecto al valor medido al comienzo de la inducci\u00f3n anest\u00e9sica. Sin embargo , cuando la presi\u00f3n arterial cayo por debajo de 60 mmHg , ese animal se elimino del estudio. 153 Chaper 5 5.1 General discussion In current veterinary anesthesia one of the \"Holy Grail\" is to find to assess anesthesia. The effects difficult establish (Haskins 1996) , but these events could modify the behavior and the q uality of lif e for animals and it is an important welfare matter . The depth of anesthesia will be a major contribute to the standardization of animal care, in clinical practi ce and in research aiming at achieving an adequate anesthetic protocol. At the beginning of the time frame of this thesis the CSM had recently been introduced as an intra -operative monitor of anesthetic depth (Zhong, Guo et al. analysis uses the collected EEG as fuzzy logic analysis. This methodological approach seems to be the best way to quantify the depth of anesthesia in dogs with a previously eloped human monitor because this monitor establishes the variables based on a no n-restricted mathematical structure . The data is analy zed with no prior assumption of the mathematical relationship which me ans that the monitor does not assume an underlying mathematical model governing the (Gambus, Jensen et al. 2010) . Another reason to use this monitor was the fact that this was a novel small handheld monitor that derives the EEG from three forehead electrodes , but with a connector that makes it to use ordinary ECG elect rodes with snap connectors. This allows an easy application and it is also an inexpensive of using electrodes The efficacy of depth of anesthesia monitoring devices are not the same for the quantification of sedation, measuring the effect site concentration detection level of consciousness (Bruhn, Myles et al. 2006) . These variables require calibration points and order the the CSM monitor to veterinary to inform levels anesthesia are present Litvan et al. 2006) . In the present thesis all of these aspects were analyzed. The effect of the propofol in the brain i expected gradually EEG index. However, in all of studies this was exactly The highest between CSI values and the PropCp during the maintenance of anesthesia with different PropCp. It must be taken in to exact prediction while for prediction probability in this case. A potential reason for the poor correlation between CSI and PropCp in our studies could be the appl ication of the Beth\u00b4s model. This model is depict ed from a dogs ' population sample, with its inevitable variations between real plasma concentrations of propofol and plasma target concentration (PropCp). In humans was that PropCp could be clinically for TCI use (Coetzee, Glen et al. 1995; Fechner, Albrecht et al. 19 98). Although one of the main limitations during this study could be the lack of quantification of the real propofol concentration in the blood, the used a reliable pharmacokinetic international than a safe way of monitoring depth of anesthesia while reliable anesthesia monitors for veterinary use.. In the discussion of our results, we must take in to account that when a human monitor is used to evaluate the dogs EEG patterns the accura cy could be diminished. For example, when the BIS m onitor was the EEG as an indication that the animal is waking up, showing high BIS values (Greene, Benson et al. 2004) . Another factor that may be related to this poor correlation is the EMG, which is the most significant source of EEG art ifact. Variations in EMG activity are associated with rapid changes in B IS values in dogs (Greene, Benson et al. 2002) . Despite the fact that on the CSI algorithm (Jensen, 155 Litvan et al. 2006) . The influence of EMG in dogs may be particularly importan t due to the amount of muscles in the head compared to humans. The influence of EMG on the CSI values was a constant observation in our study and it seems to be the main reason for the high standard deviation obs erved in the CSI values in the second study. In the third study it was observed a PK of 0,8 between EMG and CSI. When the performance of the CSM monitor was evaluated during induction of anesthesia , and based on the clinical state of the patient it was not observed a significant correlation between CSI and anesthetic planes. dogs with TCI, a sequentially increase in the anesthetic depth from plane A to E followed by a in CSI values was observed . distinguis accurately the anesthetic C CSI values were overlapped at different anesthetic planes . The main reason for the differences between both studies may be related with t he influence of EMG on the CSI va lues, were observed in planes C, D and E, than in the third study where TCI was used. It is fundamental for the clinician to know when excessive levels of anesthesia are and frequently observed during plane E both and was associated with the lowest CSI values whe n the majority of the dogs lost their reflex. In in study information depth of anesthesia when using propofol. It is known that propofol decreases the arterial pressur e by central depression of sympathetic neural output, which infusion is monitoring depth of an esthesia , and strength ens the need for a n EEG based monitor for veterinary use. 156 Cap\u00edtulo 5 5.1 Discusi\u00f3n general En anestesia veterinaria el encontrar un monitor que nos mida la profundidad anest \u00e9sica de forma eficiente y fiable se ha convertido en la b\u00fasqueda del \"Santo Grial\". Es imposible la evaluaci\u00f3n de la profundidad de la anest\u00e9sica basada en la observaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica, reflejos oculares, movimiento ocular, tono mandibular, etc., cuando se utilizan bloqueante s neuromusculares. Por lo tanto, la evaluaci\u00f3n de objetiva de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica ser\u00e1 una gran ayuda en la normalizaci\u00f3n del cuidado de los animales, en la pr\u00e1ctica cl\u00ednica y en la investigaci\u00f3n para garantizar el adecuado protoc olo anest\u00e9sico. Al comienzo de esta tesis el CSM se hab\u00eda introducido recientemente como un monitor intraoperatorio de profundidad anest\u00e9sica (Zhong, Guo et al 2005). El an\u00e1lisis b\u00e1sico del CSM utiliza las variaciones del electroencefalograma durante la a nestesia, que despu\u00e9s son analizadas seg\u00fan de la l\u00f3gica difusa. Este enfoque metodol\u00f3gico parece ser la mejor manera de cuantificar la profundidad de la anestesia en perros , utilizando un monitor humano previamente desarrollado, porque el monitor establece la relaci\u00f3n entre las variables bas\u00e1ndose en una estructura matem\u00e1tica no restringida. (Gambus, Jensen et al 2010). Otra raz\u00f3n por la que elegimos este monito r fue que es peque\u00f1o , que se transporta con facilidad, y que solo utiliza tres electrodos en la o btenci\u00f3n d el EEG , siendo adem\u00e1s posible el utilizar electrodos de ECG normales , de f\u00e1cil aplicaci\u00f3n y barat os (Seitsonen, Yli -Hankala et al 2000). La eficacia de los dispositivos que monitorizan la profundidad de la anestesia, no es la misma para la cuan tificaci\u00f3n de sedaci\u00f3n, que para medir la concentraci\u00f3n del f\u00e1rmaco en el \"effect site\" de los anest\u00e9sicos y para detecci\u00f3n del nivel de conciencia (Bruhn, Myles et al 2006). Cada una de estas variables requiere puntos de calibraci\u00f3n diferentes. Para evalua r la aplicabilidad del monitor CSM en anestesia veterinaria, los valores obtenidos del \u00cdndice deben cumplir algunas premisas: a. Exacta correlaci\u00f3n del \u00cdndice con la concentraci\u00f3n del f\u00e1rmaco en el cerebro, 157 b. Exacta correlaci\u00f3n del \u00cdndice con el estado cl\u00ednico de los pacientes. c. El \u00cdndice obtenido debe indicar al cl\u00ednico cuando existe n niveles excesivos de anestesia , o cuando aumenta o disminuye la profundidad de la anestesia. (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006). En la presente memoria presentada para obtener el grado de doctor se analizaron todos estos aspectos. Esper\u00e1bamos que el efecto de propofol en el cerebro aumentara gradualmente con el aumento de las concentraciones del f\u00e1rmaco, y que por otro lado, estos cambios se debier \u00edan reflejar se directamente en el \u00edndic e obtenido a partir de los cambios del EEG. Sin embargo, en todos nuestros estudios esto no se ha observ\u00f3 exactamente. El valor m\u00e1s alto ten\u00eda un PK de 0,65 para la relaci\u00f3n entre los valores de la CSI y la PropCp durante el mantenimiento de la anestesia c on diferentes PropCp. Debe tenerse en cuenta que el valor PK 1,0 significa una predicci\u00f3n exacta siempre, mientras que un PK de 0.5 no es mejor que una precisi\u00f3n de 50:50 . Por lo tanto, el valor de PK de 0,65 se considera un valor bajo de probabilidad de p redicci\u00f3n. Una raz\u00f3n posible para la baja correlaci\u00f3n entre CSI y PropCp en nuestros estudios podr\u00eda ser la aplicaci\u00f3n del modelo Beth\u00b4s. Este modelo se obtuvo con muestras de una poblaci\u00f3n de perros, pero ten\u00eda inevitables variaciones entre las concentrac iones en plasma real de propofol y la concentraci\u00f3n plasm\u00e1tica de destino (PropCp). En los seres humanos se observ\u00f3 que variaciones de un 20 -30% entre las concentraciones en plasma propofol y PropCp eran cl\u00ednicamente aceptables para uso TCI (Coetzee, Gle n et al. 1995; Fechner, Albrecht et al. 1998). Sin embargo nosotros seguimos pensando que una de las principales limitaciones de este estudio pudo ser la falta de cuantificaci\u00f3n de la concentraci\u00f3n de propofol real en la sangre , y que tendr\u00edamos que profu ndizar en la farmacocin\u00e9tica del propofol ( Beths, T y col. 2001, Tambi\u00e9n debemos tener cuenta que cuando se u tiliza un monitor para evaluar los patrones EEG en perros , que esta calibrado para usarse en el hombre , la precisi\u00f3n p uede disminuir. La PropCp tuvo una mejor correlaci\u00f3n y un PK mas alto con los signos cl\u00ednicos de la escala bas ada en los reflejos oculares, que con el CSI, por lo que consideramos que esta evaluaci\u00f3n es una manera mas segura de controlar la profundidad de la anestesia mientras no encontremos un monitor fiable que sirva para medir la profundidad 158 anest\u00e9sica para uso veterinario. Por ejemplo, cuando el monitor BIS se aplic\u00f3 a la evaluaci\u00f3n de la profundidad de la anestesia en cerdos, los resultados suministrados parec\u00edan i nterpretar el BS en el EEG como una indicaci\u00f3n de que el animal se est\u00e1 despertando, mostrando valores elevados de \u00edndice biespectral (BIS) . (Greene, Benson et al. 2004). Otro factor que puede estar relacionado con esta baja correlaci\u00f3n es el EMG, que es l a fuente m\u00e1s importante de artefactos de EEG, Las variaciones en la actividad de EMG se asocian con r\u00e1pidos cambios en los valores de BIS en perros (Greene, Benson et al. 2002). A pesar de que el algoritmo CSI incorpora un filtro de EMG que elimina la mayo r\u00eda de la actividad EMG, todav\u00eda puede interferir, y tener una influencia significativa en el algoritmo del CSI (Jensen, Litvan et al. 2006). La influencia de EMG en perros puede ser particularmente importante debido a la cantidad de m\u00fasculos que hay en la cabeza del perro en comparaci\u00f3n con los seres humanos. La influencia de EMG en los valores del \u00edndice CSI fue una observaci\u00f3n constante en nuestro estudio. En el tercer trabajo, se observ\u00f3 un PK de 0,8 entre EMG y CSI. En el siguiente estudio s e administr o propofol en infusi\u00f3n constante de 200 ml/hora en concentraci\u00f3n del 1%. En este trabajo se introdujeron los signos cl\u00ednicos, reflejos oculares, posici\u00f3n del globo ocular, etc. con el fin de observar la correlaci\u00f3n entre las concentraciones plasm\u00e1ticas est imadas de propofol y los signos cl\u00ednicos observados durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia. Sin embargo el rendimiento del \"Cerebral State Monitor\", no se corresponde con las observaciones cl\u00ednicas en los diferentes planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica. Durante el mantenimiento da la anestesia con TCI (Target controlled infusions) en que se aumento secuencialmente el PropCp se observ\u00f3 un incremento de la profundidad anest\u00e9sica desde el plano A al plano E, seguido por una disminuci\u00f3n en los valores del \u00cdndice d e Estado Cerebral (CSI). El PK obtenido fue de 0,74 lo significa que el CSI no puede distinguir con precisi\u00f3n entre los planos anest\u00e9sicos, B, C y D, porque los valores del \u00edndice se superponen en diferentes planos anest\u00e9sicos. La principal raz\u00f3n de las diferen cias entre ambos estudios puede estar relacionada con la influencia de EMG en los valores del CSI, porque durante la inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia com propofol a una velocidad de 200 ml/h se observaron valores EMG mayores en los planos, C, D y E, que en el tercer estudio donde se utiliz\u00f3 el TCI 159 Es fundamental para el cl\u00ednico saber cuando esta en planos profundos de la anestesia y en ellos la BS (Burst supresi\u00f3n) desempe\u00f1a un papel importante. La BS se refiere a per\u00edodos isoel\u00e9ctrico interrumpidos por b reves intervalos de actividad del EEG de gran amplitud. Este patr\u00f3n se desarrolla durante los niveles de anestesia profunda (Rampil 1998; Greene, Benson et al. 2002).La BS se observ\u00f3 con frecuencia durante el plano E en ambos estudios y se asoci\u00f3 con los v alores m\u00e1s bajos del \u00cdndice (CSI), que era cuando la mayor\u00eda de los perros perdi\u00f3 su reflejo corneal. De hecho, es importante destacar el valor de PK 0.91 observado entre BSR y los planos anest\u00e9sicos. Los par\u00e1metros hemodin\u00e1micos analizados en est a memoria proporcionan muy poca informaci\u00f3n en cuanto a la profundidad de la anestesia conseguida con la administraci\u00f3n de propofol. Se sabe que el propofol disminuye la presi\u00f3n arterial de la sangre por que produce depresi\u00f3n simp\u00e1tica central, que da como resultado una disminuci\u00f3n en la resistencia vascular sist\u00e9mica y una potencial hipotensi\u00f3n (Clayes, Gepts et al. 1988). La velocidad de la infusi\u00f3n de propofol tambi\u00e9n es un factor importante que influye en los efectos hemodin\u00e1micos producidos por el propofol (Br\u00e1s , Bressan et al 2009). En nuestros estudios, los perros mostraban un perfil hemodin\u00e1mico estable.La buena estabilidad hemodin\u00e1mica observada durante los estudios realizados por nosotros en la anestesia con propofol en perros limita la utilidad de los datos hemodin\u00e1micos para controlar la profundidad de la anestesia y refuerza la necesidad de desarrollar un monitor basado en las modificaciones del EEG para uso veterinario. 160 Chapter 6 6- General conclusion. In human medicine, m endpoints. During the of this thesis, one of the main problems dealt with was this scale could be a useful tool to ass ess depth of an esthesia in dogs. The main conclusions from the investigational studies in this thesis are: establishment visual objective clinical based on the of could be used to collect EEG skin - electrode impedances indicating rel iable skin prepar ation with both changes increasing and decreasing propofol g during induction of anesthesia with propofol; 4. During induction of anesthesia the performance of CSM was not consistent with the clinical observations on the different planes of depth of anesthesia . This may limit its use during the induction of veterinary routine anesthesia ; 5. The CSI values proposed showed a intermediate planes of 7. The EMG is an important variable to take in account sinc e the performance of the CSM monitor could be greatly affected by this type of electrical activity; 8. TCI to be a user -friendly it to change the anesthetic by the anesthesiologist. Its use will probably increa se in general veterinary anesthesia practice, since it is a good methodology to perform TIVA; 9. Hemodynamic s 6.1- Future research this researh it became clear that the approach should be the development of a monitor of depth of anesthesia just to be used in veterinary patients. The optimal monitor of depth of will be one that integrates multivariables that are displayed in the monitor, and interpreted according to the anesthesia moments. Monitors that combine both and evoked cerebral signals are now under Pilge al. 2009) . Probably the EMG could be used as a part of the signal, where the EMG's usefulness is related to the immediate activation of the frontal muscle al. 2004) . In the future , the equipment to measures cerebral drug effect will be considered as an integral part of the anesthetic monitoring set up. This will allow the anesthesiologists to Conclusiones 1.- La buena estabilidad hemodin\u00e1mica proporcionada por el propofol, incluso en altas concentraciones, proporciona poca informaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica para controlar la profun didad anest\u00e9sica. 2.- El establecimiento de una escala cl\u00ednica objetiva visual para ev aluar la profundidad de la anestesia basada en los reflejos oculares puede ser una herramienta \u00fatil para conocer la profundidad anest\u00e9sica en perros, ya que no encontram os otros signos cl\u00ednicos m\u00e1s fiables y mejores para medir la profundidad anest\u00e9sica. 3.- Los electrodos utilizados en la realizaci\u00f3n de un electrocardiograma se pueden utilizar para recoger la se\u00f1al del electroencefalograma desde valores bajos de las impedancias piel -electrodo, pero hay que tener especial cuidado en conseguir un buen contacto, y haber preparado antes la piel con limpieza y alcohol. 4.- Cambios el\u00e9ctricos cerebrales inducidos por la variaci\u00f3n de concentraciones del propofol en la etapa de inducci\u00f3n de la anestesia se detectan en el \u00cdndice de Estado cerebral (CSI) medido por el \"Cerebral State Monitor\" (CSM) . 5.- Sin embargo el rendimiento del CSM no mostraba relaciones constantes y fiables con las observaciones cl\u00ednicas en los diferent es planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica, lo que limitar\u00eda su uso al periodo de inducci\u00f3n anest\u00e9sica en anestesias de rutina. 6.- Los valores del \u00cdndice de Estado cerebral (CSI) medido por el \"Cerebral State Monitor\" (CSM) muestran una alta probabilidad de re laci\u00f3n (PK) con los planos anest\u00e9sicos obtenidos, cuando suministramos diferentes concentraciones de propofol con el TCI (Target controlled infusions), pero no era capaz de distinguir los planos intermedios de anestesia. 7.- El \"Cerebral State Monitor\" (C SM) e s capaz de detectar y funcionar con planos profu ndos de anest esia cuando existe BS ( Burst supresi\u00f3n). 163 8.- La electromiograf\u00eda es una t\u00e9cnica que hay que tener en cuenta porque la eficacia del monitor CSM puede verse afectada por este tipo de actividad el\u00e9ctrica. 9.- En nuestra experiencia el TCI es una t\u00e9cnica f\u00e1cil de usar, pero todav\u00eda tiene que mejorar y avanzar para conseguir mejores monitores para medir los diferentes planos de profundidad anest\u00e9sica, y que su desarrollo se adapte para pacientes veterinarios. 6.1-Futuras investigaciones Durante nuestras investigaciones qued\u00f3 claro que el enfoque futuro debe ser el desarrollo de un monitor de profundidad anest\u00e9sica dise\u00f1ado s\u00f3lo para pacientes veterinarios. Monitores que combinan se\u00f1ale s de electrofisiolog\u00eda cerebral espont\u00e1nea y potenciales evocados est\u00e1n ahora desarroll\u00e1ndose para los seres humanos (Cuerno, Pilge et al. 2009). El monitor \u00f3ptimo para medir la profundidad de la anestesia ser\u00e1 uno que integre multivariables que se muestre n en el monitor y que se puedan interpretar y relacionar con los diferentes planos de anestesia. Probablemente el EMG podr\u00eda utilizarse como parte de la se\u00f1al, porque como hemos visto el EMG est\u00e1 relacionado con la activaci\u00f3n del m\u00fasculo frontal, que a su vez est\u00e1 relacionada con la anestesia inadecuada, y la inminencia de recuperar la conciencia y fuerte nociception (Viertio -Oja, Maja et al 2004). En el futuro, estos monitores que nos cuantifican el efecto de las drogas en el cerebro se considerar\u00e1n com o parte integrante del control de la anestesia. Esto permitir\u00e1 a los anestesi\u00f3logos ser capaces de diferenciar y cuantificar los efectos de las drogas anest\u00e9sicas. 164 Reference s: Adragna, M.
