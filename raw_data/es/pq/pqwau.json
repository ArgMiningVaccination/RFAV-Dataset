Two woody materials, commercial stemwood (ST) and demolition and construction wood (DC) were selected because of the differences in their persistent organic pollutants (POPs), ash and metals content. For household waste, we used a municipal solid waste (MSW) and a refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from MSW with 5-20 wt% and up to 5 wt% food waste content respectively. No clear effect on the formation of pollutants was observed with different food waste content in the fuel blends tested. Combustion of ST-based fuels was very inefficient which led to high PAH emissions (32 \u00b1 3.8 mg/kgfuel). The use of DC clearly increased the total PCDD and PCDF emissions (71 \u00b1 26 g/kgfuel) and had a clear effect on the formation of toxic congeners (210 \u00b1 87 ng WHO2005-TEQ/kgfuel). The high PCDD and PCDF emissions from DC-based fuels can be attributed to the presence of material contaminants such as small pieces of metals or plastics as well as timber treated with chromated copper arsenate preservatives and pentachlorophenol in the DC source.", "sitename": "Elsevier", "date": "2018-07-19", "cleaned_text": "Informaci\u00f3n del item - Informaci\u00f3 de l'item - Item from co-combustion of wood and household waste fuel blends| |Autor/es: |[Edo Gim\u00e9nez, del Nanotecnolog\u00eda (REMAN)| |Centro, Departamento |Palabras clave: and construction wood and household waste were combusted in a small-scale experimental set-up to study the effect demolition and construction wood (DC) were and metals content.
