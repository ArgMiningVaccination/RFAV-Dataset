Thanks These are diseases that were once worldwide problems and are now incredibly rare. Because of lives over decades. How Vaccines Work The system is comprised of various cells, organs, and fluids in the body that are designed to fight off germs through the production of special known as that specific germ. However, it takes time for the body to create the right type of antibody, meaning the person still the the or death by contracting the disease. Different immunizations last for different periods of time. You get a flu shot every year, while you only get a vaccine for whopping cough every ten years or so. Once the antibody has been created, the body remembers it. It is almost as if it stores the blueprint for the antibody and has the ability to call upon that blueprint any time it recognizes the same antigen. If the antigen in question infects the body again, even if it occurs many years later, the body is able to proper same antigens as the disease but have been weakened or are dead so they are unable to create the disease itself. These antigens are still cause the body to create the antibodies required to fight off the antigen. Because immunization involves introducing antigens into the body, no matter how weak they are, it is not a good idea to \"overload\" your child's immune system. This is why there is a standard schedule for special immunization for children, helping to introduce the elements over a period of time as their bodies grow stronger and fight off the disease.
