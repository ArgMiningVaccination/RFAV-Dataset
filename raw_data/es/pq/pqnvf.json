Nuestro objetivo fue determinar la prevalencia de especies de Ancylostomideos humanos en poblaciones de Argentina nativas o provenientes de \u00e1reas end\u00e9micas, combinando los resultados de microscop\u00eda y PCR. Un total de 140 muestras fecales seriadas fueron obtenidas de individuos nacidos en la provincia de Misiones con residencia en esta y de miembros de una comunidad oriunda del Paraguay establecida en la provincia de Buenos Aires. Las muestras fueron examinadas por la t\u00e9cnica de formol-acetato de etilo (FAE) y una t\u00e9cnica de flotaci\u00f3n como pruebas de cribado, y se efectuaron PCR espec\u00edcas para N. americanus y A. duodenale . Caracterizamos muestras que contienen N. americanus secuenciando un fragmento del gen del citocromo b. La prevalencia de Ancylostomideos seg\u00fan las pruebas de cribado y el m\u00e9todo PCR fueron del 24,3 y 32,8%, respectivamente. Las muestras positivas por PCR se identicaron como N. americanus . La PCR tuvo una sensibilidad del 100,0% en comparaci\u00f3n con el 73,9% de las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n. Hubo 12 muestras de individuos con miembros de la familia infectados con anquilostomas que solo por PCR fueron positivas. Las secuencias de N. americanus mostraron un 90,5% de identidad y fueron m\u00e1s similares entre s\u00ed que a cualquiera de las secuencias obtenidas de GenBank. Este es el primer estudio que proporciona datos moleculares y la caracterizaci\u00f3n de N. americanus en Argentina. El uso com- plementario de FAE y una t\u00e9cnica de flotaci\u00f3n para detectar infecciones por anquilostomas, seguido de PCR para diferenciar las especies, contribuye a producir mejores estimaciones de prevalencia.\u00a9 2022 Asociaci \u00b4on Argentina de Microbiolog Espana, S.L.U. Este es tend prevalent in the tropics and for majority of human hookworm cases worldwide, A. duodenale more endemic in the Mediter- ranean region, China and Africa.43 Hookworm species not only differ in their and clinical the severity of anemia differs depending on the more loss per than N. americanus35. Furthermore, A. for monitoring the severity of effective treatment63. Several methods are which have already proven factors, as infections in endemic Africa4,48,58,61, very few prevalence studies which apply these techniques in human populations from South American countries25,33,45,62. Argentina belongs to the southernmost region of Amer- ica, and is characterized by high variability of its climatic and socioeconomic conditions. In this country, the frequency of intestinal parasites shows a declining trend from north to south and from east to west47. With regard to human 269A. Servi\u00e1n, S.A. Repetto, M.

Distribution of human hookworm infections reported for geographic area. Adapted from 7, 11, 17, 29, 33, 37, 47. This map was created using QGIS 3.4.14 Madeira the infection was mainly recorded in the north of Argentina, being most prevalent in the provinces of Salta and Misiones (Fig. 1)9,12,78. In the province of Misiones, the physical environment favors the high prevalence of theseparasites. Actually, Rivero et de Microbiolog\u00eda in areas with abundant arboreal-shrubby vegetation. On the other hand, in non-endemic areas of Argentina, such as Buenos Aires, there are no updated studies The province of Buenos Aires, located in the center of Argentina, is characterized by temperate climate and the soil has a silty- - -loam cycle. , the high degree of immigrant people from endemic areas (mainly from Paraguay) living in the province of Buenos Aires makes it an important region to be studied42,44. To date, most studies infections in on coproculture6,19,77and only one was based on molecular The single molecular study that dif- ferentiates hookworm species was performed in Salta (36.4%) was more prevalent than A. duodenale (19.1%)12. The knowledge of the distribution of these parasites, both in endemic and non-endemic regions, is the infection each parasite in each geographic area. This information would help to make a better diagnosis of patients and control programs species by combining results of PCR samples the biology of these parasites. Materials and methods Study area and subject sampling Human fecal samples were collected from populations from two provinces in Argentina, representing two different ecoregions: the Province of Buenos Aires, located in the Pampas ecoregion and the Province of Misiones, located in the Paran\u00e1 Atlantic Forest. All samples were obtained as part of a larger cross-sectional conditions in human In the Province of Buenos Aires, 34 fecal samples were collected from immigrants from Paraguay, aged 1- years who had resided in regions of the district of La Plata (3455/prime17.22/prime/primeS 5757/prime16.31/prime/primeW) for a period of residence ranging from 6 months to 22 years, being 8 years the average period. In the Province of Misiones, 106 samples were collected from indi- viduals, aged 1- - -40 years old, from rural areas in neighboring villages in the locality of Arist\u00f3bulo Del Valle (2705/prime43/prime/primeS and had written and oral consent were included. Children or youths were included after theirparents and legal had received some antiparasitic treatment by the time of the research were excluded. The area of study in Buenos Aires is a non-endemic region for hookworms, characterized by a temperate climate and poor structural and socio-environmental conditions. The area is inhabited by immigrants from Paraguay, a hookworm endemic country. Most families with parents having unskilled informal jobs. The rural areas studied in the Province of Misiones are characterized by favorable conditions for the persistence of human hookworm vegetation. Most of the on small- scale farming, and others belong to indigenous groups, who have their homes in open clearings in the jungle. Sample collection After consent was obtained, each individual vials. When participants were children, samples were collected by their parents or legal guardians. Fecal samples were submitted to Centro de Estudios Para- sitol\u00f3gicos y de Vectores (La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina) from April 2018 to October 2019. During this period, the pro- cedure included microscopic examination (screening tests) and molecular analyses samples to parasites. First, each sample was ltered through a double layer of gauze to remove the ethanol solution and 5% formalin until fecal suspension was ltered and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Then, 7 ml of formalin and 3 ml of ethyl acetate were added to the sediment, mixed and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. A saturated sodium chloride solution (S. G. = 1.2 g/ml) was vermicu- laris as analysis of the population studied. 271A. Servi\u00e1n, S.A. Repetto, M. Lorena Zonta et al. Hookworm L3 larvae In order to determine PCR sensitivity, lariform larvae (L3) were isolated from fresh fecal samples. These samples were obtained from three volunteers, who were not part of the sampling performed as object of this study, with a positive parasitological test for hookworm eggs. For this purpose, 4 of fresh fecal hookworm individual 1-cm-wide strips of lter paper and placed into open 15 ml conical tubes. Ster- ile water was added to the bottom of each tube so that the meniscus was about 0.5 cm below the fecal mass. The vol- ume of liquid in each tube was adjusted as needed, and larvae were collected from the bottom of the tubes on day 763. The morphological differentiation of the L3s of N. americanus from those A. duodenale was based on the criteria: measuring of the larva; examining the for of americanus . Molecular analysis DNA isolation from fecal samples Prior to extraction, 500 mg of fecal/ethanol suspension was centrifuged at 8000 \u00d7 g, and the pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of sterilized saline buffer. After centrifu- gation, the pellet to DNA designed BLAST software of the National Center for Biotechnol- ogy Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). cytochrome b (cob) in GenBank (Acc.

In order to compare the performance of the diagnos- tic tests, a minimum size of 125 were calculated using R software version 3.6.3 (R Core Team 2020) through library bdpv60. These values were given interpretation of values from Watson and Petrie71and according to the criteria of Fleiss et al.22 through library irr24. This test was performed to determine statistical the techniques - -MW711819. Results and screening A total of 140 fecal samples from individuals from the provinces of Buenos Aires and Misiones were subjected to the initial screening tests for hookworm infection consist- ing of microscopic on FECT in Misiones and 8.82% CI [2.45%- - -22.87%] in Buenos Aires. On the other hand, the prevalence based on flotation technique was in Misiones [1.05%- - Aires. Globally, in Misiones and 8.82% CI [2.45%- - -22.87%] in Buenos Aires. The overall prevalence of parasites was 76.5% in Buenos Aires and 77.3% in Misiones, being Blastocystis sp. and E. vermicularis hookworm DNA from fragment of Fig. S3). The analytical specicity of N. americanus and A. duodenale PCR with DNA samples from patients with pathogens, counts of N. americanus larvae (1 L3, 30 L3, 50 L3 and 100 L3). All these samples showed amplication, except the one with a single lariform L3 (supplementary Fig. S3). Differential diagnosis by PCR Based on the results from the validation, all the fecal sam- ples (n = 140) were subjected to PCR for the differential diagnosis of amplied. In addition, that were found to be negative by microscopy were found to be positive only by PCR. All these samples corresponded to individuals with at least one in Misiones [5.97%- - -30.39%] in Buenos Aires. 273A. Servi\u00e1n, S.A. Repetto, M. Lorena Zonta et al.

Molecular and phylogenetic analysis A total of 12 cob sequences of 169 bp were successfully obtained from N. americanus corresponded to singleton variable sites two variants, and -11 nucleotides).

In Argentina, very few reported the copro- culture as means of species identication6,12,19,77. In this we proposed to determine the of hookworm species by morphological and molecular tech- niques, as a way to study endemic populations for these parasites methods for technically results in addition to those the screening These cases corresponded to indi- with at least one household member positive for hookworms. With regard to the last point, many authors indi- cated that the is higher in fami- lies whose members not only live in the same but share the same factors better the predisposition to heavy or hookworm infections52. A parasitic between PCR and screening tests was moderate to substantial and the NPV was higher for PCR. This result shows that the microscopy analysis and the PCR method evaluated here may be used as complementary tools, Servi\u00e1n, S.A. Repetto, M. Lorena al. Figure distance matrix showing based on pairwise comparison of the of the cob gene among the sequences obtained in this study, and 4 sequences of available at the GenBank database. There was a total of 169 positions in the nal dataset.

Nos. Sequences obtained in the present study are in bold. Nodal (>50%) is indicated above eggs. This last consideration may explain the low sensitivity of the screening tests, in comparison with the PCR to detect hookworm PCR to differentiate the hookworm species. PCR may be egg-positive but also on individu- with household members. This diagnos- tic strategy includes the preservation of a series of fecal samples in 70% ethanol. This method of sample collection allows to perform morphological and molecular techniques without the need to ask people for a fresh sample to conrm the diagnosis. In this sense, unpreserved stool samples are preferred for molecular studies, stored and transported stool samples transportation temperature for least 3 months67. Our diagnostic strategy is agreement of who recommended the examination of multiple stool samples and the use of different techniques for the N. americanus and this result was consistent with previous worldwide studies as the pre- dominant human hookworm species43,45. On the other hand, A. duodenale is more focally endemic in India, China, Africa, and a few regions of the Americas43. With respect to A. ceylanicum , study hookworm species infecting humans in Asia, and was only found in dogs in South America in 197634,49,53. In Argentina, the few studies which made differential al.6studied the prevalence of intestinal parasitism in children from the Province of Corrientes, and recorded a prevalence of 12% for N. americanus , 1% for A. and 4% asymptomatic population from Province of and detected a prevalence of 36.4% of the hookworm cases identied by species in a study about treatment of soil-transmitted helminths in the Province of highest in adults36,43. In this study, these helminths were found in both children and adults. In Buenos Aires, adults were the most this case Paraguay, which is a hookworm endemic area59. In this regard, these parasites can reside for many years in the small intestine of their hosts and it is known that elderly individuals in hookworm-endemic areas harbor the heaviest burdens8,30. On the other hand, chil- dren were the most infected in Misiones. In general, the riskof hookworm infection in children has been associated with wearing shoes, hand wash practice and personal hygiene20. Hence, children from Misiones likely got infected due Misiones in previous studies23,46,56,78, a lower value (38.7%) was found in the rural area studied. In accor- dance with our results, of Misiones. This decrease in the frequency of infection may be due to control children, recommended by the WHO73. To date, there are no molecular studies available on the differential diagnosis of hookworm in Similarly, there are and no current stud- ies that report hookworm infections in Buenos Aires37. It known that dependent on environmen- tal factors, being the soil and climate conditions of Buenos Aires survival of hookworm eggs. How- ever , this study was focused on the immigrant population from Paraguay, with an average of 8 years of residence in Buenos Aires, taking into account that hookworm infec- tion remains one most chronic infections in humans. In fact, it was estimated that A. duodenale can live in the human intestine on average from 1 to 3 years, and N. americanus from 3 to 10 years, with a maximum lifespan of 18 years10. In this regard, Waks70also overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in Buenos Aires. In this study, it was found that 4.7% of 1218 subjects were infected with N. americanus. in the immi- grant population studied from La Plata city in Buenos Aires. Gamboa et al.23also reported sporadic cases of hookworm infections in suburban areas of La Plata (3 out of the 312 individuals studied); however , they did not the geographical origin of the population under study. On the other hand, Castex and Greenway10reported four human cases of infections caused by A. duodenale in this province, proposing that these cases were indigenous because the people studied had no history of residence in endemic areas. The samples that tested positive only by PCR were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. This last analysis showed that all the sequences of N. americanus included in this study were grouped into a monophyletic clade. We found the primers designed in house were compared, and a maximum of 11 nucleotides when the pairwise analysis was performed. In this sense, when Hu et al.31compared the complete sequence of the cob gene between N. americanus from Togo with another from China (1113 nucleotides), 6% of divergence was found. We obtained slightly homologous amplication products within the cob gene represent poly- morphisms in the sequence among that may have on 277A. Servi\u00e1n, S.A. Repetto, M.

Conclusion In conclusion, in the present study, the aim was to gener- ate better hookworm prevalence estimates infections.

This is the rst study that contributes to the record of N. americanus in two different populations from different geographic areas in Argentina based on molecular data. Moreover , sequences of the cob provided for isolates of N. americanus contributed to the scarce molecular information about this parasite in these regions.
