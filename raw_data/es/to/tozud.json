Contaminated sediments can also be a long-term source of toxic substances to the environment and can impact wildlife and humans through the consumption of food or water or through direct contact.

The most carefully collected and analyzed data are of no use if the data collected are insufficient or of the wrong type. To avoid either of these and other potentially costly errors, EPA the use of the Process. The DQO Process is a management tool designed to help data users and data collectors design the systematic that enables the manager to refine goals and objectives and help answer the question, \"How much data is enough?\" As the steps of and step in process is to specify the problem and identify limitations of data-collection effort. This process allows one to evaluate his or her current knowl- edge base of the problems and identify all avail- able resources. The next step is to identify what decisions or activities will be made based on the data. The answer to this question is vital to ensure the collection of the right type of data. The decision goals should be as narrow in scope as possible, and considerable effort may be re- quired to define them properly. The third step involves identifying all vari- ables focuses on eliminating the potential measurement or collection of data that may not actually be used in the decision-making process. The next step requires the data collector to set or define the boundaries of the study, including the population, which could consist of people, objects, or media, and the boundaries on the population, including space, time, and area. Developing a decision rule, or how the data will be used and summarized, is the next step in the process. This step involves describing how the study results compiled study results as \"If the results be this.\" For example, \"If PCB levels in fish greater than 2 ppm, then a fish consumption advisory will be issued.\" This step, along with the others, helps define the data collec- tion effort specifying the limits of uncertainty acceptable able false-positive must the consequences incorrect and false-negative errors vary with the decision being defined. If a decision to take regulatory action is being made, a possible false-negative error could result in no action being data It is essential that the potential consequences to economic, health, ecological, political, and social issues be considered when deciding on acceptable false-positive and error rates. This may the consultation of a during the DQO Process should Super- fund Site Remediation\" in excellent quality control are integral components of every aspect of a pro- gram's activities. The collection of reliable data is contingent on the use of and adherence a good Quality Assurance Project Plan; the devel- opment of a sound sampling study is contingent on the use of the DQO Process; and use and implementation of the DQO Process is contingent on a Program including the standard for open-water disposal. The degree of sediment contamination in a particular area is often evaluated collected from the area being investigated with those. in the surrounding area. The terms used to describe the different sediments from area whose quality is being assessed. A control sediment is (or nearly so) sediment, free from localized anthropogenic inputs of pollutants with contamination present only because of inputs from the global spread of pollutants (Lee et al., 1989). A control sediment is fully compatible with the needs of the organisms used in the assay, is known not cause toxicity, and is used primarily to verify the health of the test organisms and the acceptability of the test conditions (USEPA/USA- CE, 1991). The control sediment may be artifi- cially prepared in order volumes of a known and consistent quality for use in standard testing and for culturing test organisms (ASTM, 1990). A reference sediment, on the other hand, is collected from may contain low-to moderate levels of pollutants some localized anthropogen- ic sources, representing the background levels of pollutants in an area (Lee et of., 1989). The reference sediment is to be as similar as possible to the test sediments in grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), and other physical characteristics (Lee et al., 1989; USEPA/USACE, 1991; ASTM, 1990). The physical environment of the reference site should also be as similar as possible to that at the sites where the test sediments will be collect- processes such as waves and currents, sediment size, of material assessment, or on are to those obtained from reference sediments using are using Analytical Casidtmtions same control sediments to ensure that the testing was free of some extraneous factors that may have affected the reliability of the test. Depending on the study objeaives, however, controls can also be used as a benchmark which to compare sediments different (ASTM, 1990). A clear understanding of the end uses of the data is essential in the establishment of an appro- priate sampling program. A cost-effective study most undertaken one or more of the follow- ing objectives: B To fulfill a regulatory testing requirement: w To determine characteristic ambient lev- els; n To monitor trends in contamination levels; w To identify hot spots of contamination; or n To screen for potential problems. These different objectives will lead to differ- ent designs. For example, a study for a dredging project may have a specific set of guide- lines on sampling frequency, levels will strive to obtain uniform, random coverage of an area through the collection of samples from a relatively large cumber of sites. The design for a study to track sediment contamination trends will expend its resources to sample fewer sites but would concentrate efforts on fewer sites within zones most likely to be contaminated, while an initial screening study might take very few, randomly distributed samples for analysis supplement the analytical results. Available information to sampled and its surroundings should be used in about bottom topography, currents, of dredg- ing and the frequency locations of point and nonpoint sources of distribution grain sizes, and other factors can provide the basis for determining which of the sampling designs .to use (e.g., Are there reasons to expect localized hot spots of contamination?) and where to place sampling locations (e.g., Which parts of the area are likely to be similar enough to group into the same strata?). Preliminary surveys of an and horizontal distributions of sediments 1988). This methods similar areas into strata, identifying likely locations of hot The or really reflects the lack of a design. This method has no and The worst-case sampling design is based on knowledge regarding the presence and distribution of potential sources of sediment contamination in an area. II is usually considered cost-effective as long as the study objectives are being met. An inherent problem with this design is that it results in an incomplete characterization of an area and is not statistically robust. However, it can be useful as an initial survey to determine the potential for a contamination The effectiveness of this technique depends bathyme- try, and other factors. 2.2.X.3 Random The random sampling design is most useful for cases where little is known about the likely distribution of sediment contamination or sources, or when available information indicates a high degree of homogeneity in an area. The area to be sampled is divided using a grid statistically based on requirements previous two designs. Available information is used to identify different zones that are likely to be similar in degree of contamination or other characteristics. Samples sites are then randomly which is a very complete characterization. However, this is costly because of the large number of sam- ples that need to be collected. 2.2.2 Numbers of Samples Statistics can be used to determine the number of samples .needed. To use statistics in this way, one needs to decide what comparisons will be niade with the resulting data and what will be the desired statistical power of the comparisons (i.e., at what level of confidence will resulting differ- ences be tested). about the inherent environmental variability in the area (i.e., the likelihood that an observed difference is due to an actual difference in contamination rather than just the natural heterogeneity in sediment or benthic population characteristics in the area). There are many different statistical approaches to estimating the number of samples by Baudo (1990) for sediment physical and chemical testing and by Downing and Rigler (1984) for benthic community structure evaluations. In practice, of a purely statistical approach to determining the number of between statis- tical power and the cost of the study. One of the major advantages of the tiered approaches for testing and assessment is the cost savings that results when information is collected relatively inexpensively initially and additional resources are expended only when the information collected thus far is insufficient to make a decision. Guidance how to select a co&effective approach is usually provided in very general terms to the factors using two or more sampling sites (test and reference sites). time and money are assessed for each sampling scheme. Next, a statistical power analysis is conducted to calculate the number of replicate sampling and Analytical Considetatbns optimum scheme is selected production of environ- mental monitoring data of and documented quality in a cost-effective manner. QA/QC should be an integral part of the of study design, execution, and data to ensure the quality of all activities for which QA Pro- ject Plans are a vital part of the QA Program Plan. A QA Project Plan is a simply a written record of the plans that must be made and fol- lowed in executing a study. A QA Project Plan provides detailed documentation of all facets of how and why a particular study will be undertak- en. The Plan also describes the alternative actions that will be taken in the event that things do not go according to the original plans. Once all of the purposes and procedures of the proposed study are recorded in a QA Project Plan, the Plan can be improved or modified, if needed, through reviews by persons knowledgeable about different aspects of the study tool for the datacollection process, it is essential that all personnel involved in the project read and under- stand the Plan and that the Plan be studies (40 CFR, Part 15). Furthermore, nonadherence to the Plan could result in the data being unusable for court proceedings or regulatory decisions. The QA Project Plan is just as important after the study is completed and the data are being used to make an evaluation or decision. The Plan provides the information needed to assess the degree of confidence one can place in the data, as well as the comparability of the data collected in a particular study with those from another study. A common problem that managers and scientists have with using existing data is not that the old data are unreliable, but that the data are of be defined to develop an understanding of makes between a value the assumed or expect- ed value. Accuracy in percent is 100 minus the total error, which is composed of bias and random errors. can result from the basic sampling design, the kind of equipment used to collect the samples, the sample-handling the Because proper QA procedures are being used in the field and laboratory. Comparczbility is the measure of confidence one has in being able to compare one data set with another. Comparability is increased if similar field and laboratory methods were used and Canpa- rability between different is the to the sum of all features and characteristics of the data that determine its capability to satisfy the objectives of the data to interpret the degree of acceptability or utility of overa uncertainty that a decision- maker is willing to accept in results or deci- sions derived from the data, and the the data-collection effort. Duplicate samples are the same popula- tion and carried through all the same steps of sampling, storage, and analysis in an identical manner. Field blank is a clean sample (i.e., distilled water) carried to the sampling site, exposed to sampling conditions, and returned to the laboratory and treated as an environmental sample. Field blanks are to problems caused by conditions in the field, sampling device, sample containers, shipping containers, etc. Measurement error is values and the can of a particular parameter inherent in the use of a particular detection limit is can be measured with cent confidence that the analyte concentration is flea&x than zero in a particular medium (40 CFR Part 136, Appendix B).

It includes wellde- fined plans and procedures for how to ensure the sufficient data application of procedures for obtaining prescribed standards of performance in the monitoring mea- surement process. It is the effected through independent methods to verify findings, exchange of samples and standards among laboratories, and use of standard reference materials. Run&m error is nonsystematic (and, there- fore, unpredictable) error that can mr dur- ing any part of the sample collection, han- dling, and analysis. Hopefully, random errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero so that the overall evaluation will not be affected even though individual measurements will be affected. Representativeness is the degree to which the data accurately precisely represent the accuracy and Sampling error is the difference between the sampled value and the true value, and is a function of natural spatial and temporal vari- ability and sampling design. It also selected/collected improperly measurements. Sampling error is more difficult to control than the other type of error, measurement error, and typically accounts for most of the total error. Uncertuinty is the total variability in sampling and analysis including systematic error (bias) and random error.

Grab samplers have jaws that close by a trigger mechanism upon impact with the bottom surface. Grab samplers offer advantage of being able to collect a large amount of material in one sample, but they have the disadvantage of giving an unpredictable depth of penetration.

Since no set guidelines have been determined for sediment sampling, a good general rule to follow is to use containers recommended for reliable capacity, allowing only enough air space for possible expansion of the sample resulting from the significant alteration of the sample can occur in the first few hours after sampling. Immediate- ly after collection, sediment samples are typically kept on ice or refrigerated. Upon arrival at the laboratory, samples are usually preserved by drying, freezing, or cold storage (ASTM, 1990). The type of preservation required will depend on the parameters being tested. For example, if the sediment is split, since it is recommended that samples for bulk metal analysis be preserved 1991). For this reason, it is essential to know which tests are to be performed, or poten- tially performed, on the samples in advance allow additional sample collection or splitting of samples as for Requirements Specijic Analyses There are basically four analyze chemical and physical parameters of sediments: bulk analysis, descrip- tions of these types of analyses follow, along parameter within a sediment sample or the toxicity of the whole sediment.

The BSTT measures the total toxic effect of all contaminants, regardless of their physical described in Chapters 5, 10, and 11, chemical com- position of the sediments, which may be complex, need not be known. At the end of a specified time period, the response of the test organisms is in toxicity data that can be used to predict whether the test sediment will be It is assumed that the behavior of chemicals in test sediments in the laboratory is similar to that in natural in situ sediments. The effects field or in dredged materials can be predicted from laboratory results in the test sediment (Swartz et al., 1989) and without a priori knowledge of specific pathways of inter- action between sediments and test organisms (Kemp and Swartz, 1989).

Toxi- city test procedures with C. riprius and C. tentans are given in more detail in Adams .et al. (1985), Nebeker et al. (1984), Giesy et al. (1988), Ingersoll and Nelson (1989), and ASTM (1991). Partial life-cycle toxicity sediments have been in a number laboratories. H. azteca are available from various aquatic toxicology laboratories and commercial sources and can be cultured easily in a laboratory. Toxicity tests are initiated by adding juveniles ~7 days old to test chambers that contain bulk sedi- ment with sediment; Ingersoll and Nelson, 1989). 'Ihe length range from ~10 et al.

Amphipods and bulk sediments generally are collected from the field and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 2-24 days before toxicity testing. The tests are initiated by adding immature or adult amphipods to test chambers that contain bulk sediment with overlying water in various ratios. The length of the test generally is ~10 and responses given Swartz et al. (1985a), Dewitt et al. (1989), Nipper et al.

Combined with other approaches such as the AET and the Triad approaches (Chapman, can be used to quality benthic com- munity as a structure and function it must be combined with chemical measurements and other data to generate information on the effects of individual contaminants. Both the Triad and the AET approaches rely on bulk sediment toxicity suitable for any type of sediment. In some cases, the physical or chemical properties of the test sedi- men4 such as salinity or grain size, may limit the selection of organisms that can be used for testing (Ott, 1986; Dewitt et al., 1989). Appropriate controls or statistical models (Dewitt et al., 1988) for sediment properties may be necessary as grain size, must be recognized (Dewitt et al., 1988). Data can be normalized to such factors as organic carbon (DiToro al., 1990, 1991; Nebeker et al., field sediments et al., 1988; et al., can be eval- uated if the length of the test is extended to ensure adequate sensitivity to contaminants, their ability to with- stand laboratory handling, and their ability to survive in control and reference treatments (Dewitt et al., 1989, Reish and LeMay, 1988; Shuba et al., 1981).

However, the bio- logical effects of source control can be represented through use of BSTT. site test results. toxicity tests be used to monitor conditions at the disposal site both before and after a disposal operation. 3.33 General Advantages and Llmltatlons 33.2.1 Ease of Use Most sediment procedures simple to use, requiring limited expertise and standard inexpensive laboratory equipment (PSEP, 1991). Only a few sublethal effects tests require specialized training. Field sampling requires equipment and standard procedures (ASTM, 199Ob). 3.3.2.2 Relative Cost Individual laboratory toxicity tests field are cost-effective because they toxic contaminants, does not require individual chemical measurements, and does as conservative (i.e., environmentally of and of test organism.

In general, the chemical is either added to the sedi- ment and mixed in (Birge et al., 1987; Ditsworth et al., 1990; Francis et al., 1984) or added to the overlying water (Hansen and Tagatz, 1980; Kemp and with Sediments concentra- LC50 sediment for a specific length of time (Swartz et al., 1985) or by larvae of benthic species to the sediment (Hansen and Tagatz, 1980).

However, methods for sampling water measurements must be taken before, during and at the end of the exposure period. In addition, these changes must be chemical data are compared statistically with control or reference data to determine the occurrence of biological effects, and of quality and Skills Most toxicity test procedures require a mini- mum of specialized hardware and level of skill. In general, only readily available and inexpensive laboratory equipment is needed, procedures are fairly simple and straightforward, and a cal requires and equipment, the chemical sampling methods for spiked-sediment toxicity are generally simple and routine. Some effects also require used witb laboratory-spiked sediments, sediments with field sediments. contrast to acute tests, there are relatively (Scott Redmond, 1989), 1991; Nebeker et al., 1988). Chronic exposures to most sensitive are also benthic recol- disposal of toxic sediments and predict uptake of toxicants into food webs.

Tests to determine the effeds of toxicants on a particular biological community should use the most sensitive species found in community or a species which will then be used to determine the extent of the problem area.

To date, there have been few comparisons of methods and species sensitivity, and few chronic toxicity tests have been developed. 4.4.4 Outlook for Future Use and Amount of Development Yet Needed The outlook for future use of SSlTs or other sediment toxicity tests is promising where accurate, direct dose-response data are desired, or where the effects of chemical interactions need to be compiled in a comparisons can be made among species, methods, and laboratories and that R.

The smaller of the surface sizes are not as effec- tive in areas but is much the nize in stony areas.

Statistical derivation of the number of samples required decrease the variability of the data have been discussed by Green (19781, Merritt et al. (1984), Resh and Price (1984), and Klemm et al.

This prior knowledge is often not nor 8-7 a (e.g., the cost of initial sampling to estimate variability and required distribu- tion such as normal for biological samples. Also, variability, as measured by the could different each analyzed many manuals, including the new USEPA macroinvertebrate field and laboratory manual (Klemm et al., 1990), the ASTM methods for sampling benthos (ASTM, 1988), Ohio EPA's Field Methods Manual (Ohio EPA, 1989b), Standard al., 1989), USEPA's (USEPA, 1987). The follow- ing decisions will need to be made once the sample gear is chosen: m Whether samples will be picked from debris and in field, n Which should be used; n Whether a stain (rose be added to the sample to facilitate separat- ing the organisms from debris; tody form preparation of slides for identification. Klemm et al. (1990), Merritt el al. (1984), Pennack (1978) and APHA retained by and APHA et of. (1989) and Klemm et 01.

However, some types of chiro- nomidae and other small benthos pass through the #30-mesh but are be a #30-mesh sieve and that the materials washed through be passed through a &to-mesh sieve; should ihen sorted (Ohio EPA, 1989b). Once washed through the sieves the organisms should be separated from the vegetation and other debris in a white enamel pan. As the materials are separated, the organisms can be placed in different vials for the major taxa. Taxonomy--The level to which the taxonomy should be taken is dependent on the objectives of the study. For a system reconnaissance or screen- ing survey, it is generally not necessary to go beyond the family level (Hilsenhoff, 1988; Illinois EPA, 1987; Plafkin of taxonomic detail should follow the the which are must consis- tent within the program and for each study site. Species-level identifications for all organisms are not necessary for a successful program, and they commonly depend on al.

Regional U.S. EPA or state biologists should be contacted to determine which of the Types of Data Required The types of data analyses that are required to meet program objectives directly affect the types of data required.

U.S. EPA (Plafkin er al., 1989) developed a composite in&x for rapid assessments in lotic of a percent- age of the found of multiple reference sites. The RBPs are flexible and can be modified for different geographical locations, as evidenced by the use of different metrics in Arkansas (Shak- elford, 1988) and New York (Bode and Novak, 1988). The success of the RBPs is in the use of the composite index for rapid assessments that allows for three levels of taxonomic work (i.e., order, family, or genus/species levels). Order and family taxonomy do not require laboratory taxono- my and may be done in the field. The RBPs normally use single-habitat (riffle) sampling and a lOO-organism count in the field. However, they can be adapted for most program uses; for ple, by sampling to the complex benthic community measurements into a decision-makers.

Tolerance values can be found in Hilsenhoff (1987) or can be generated by regional-specific knowledge in this country was developed by Beck (1955) for Florida streams, the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index (Hilsenhoff, 1977, 1982) has gained great popularity and has been updated to revise the scoring system from a range of O-5 to of taxa, (1984), Mason et ol.

Indkator Organisms--Indicator organisms have of biotic indexes for both lotic and lentic systems. first classifications based on indicator organ- isms was done in the lllinois River by Richardson (1928). Simpson and Bode (1980), Bode and Simpson (1982), and Rae (1989), among many others, used Chironomidae as indicator organisms for stream systems. Hawkes (1979) provides an excellent macroinvertebrates for stream quality assessments, and Wiederholm (1980) does same for lake systems. Data analyses for benthic macroinvertebrates in lentic systems have not been as progressive as those in lotic systems with regard to composite et al.

The percent of the individuals within a taxon at a sample site can be compared with the percent contribution at structure. that seven as useful for detecting environmental change as richness measures or the family biolic index. Although the measures Resh (1988) used may not be optimal for widespread use, they may still provide insight into reference and a study site, with high similarity indicating little change, or impact, between the two sites. The use of similarity indexes has been reviewed by Brock (1977) and Washington (1984). The simplest indexes to apply are ibose which use only the types of taxa found, not the abundance of the organisms within each taxon. The Jaccard Index (1908) and Van Horn's Index (1950) are examples of the simpler indexes. Van Horn's Index, where: a = Number of b = Number of taxa collected at the olher site w = Number of taxa common to both stations. A value over 6.5 or 7.0 indicates good similarity. Plafkin et al.

This promising is continuing. Statistical Approaches-Various statistical approaches have been applied to determine wheth- er the benthic community at a study site varies from that at a reference or other site. An excel- lent discussion of this USEPA tical analysis may not be necessary. For instance, the endpoint is the number of taxa or richness measures, the variability is generally quite low and accuracy quite high. In this case, the differences between two communities would need to warranted a statistical change occurs. Sometimes when that change occurs, it is too late protect the apply to both the marine and freshwater systems. The reader is referred to drawback to these methods is the assumption that the data follow a statistical distribution such as a normal or lognormal distribution. This on as- sumptions about a specific distribution of the data.

The most expensive items are the samplers and the microscopes to identify the organisms. However, most state programs and contractors have this equipment available for other program needs. The fieldwork can be conducted during the time a most time-consuming aspect is the laboratory sorting and identifications, which may average 11 hours per site. However, this process compares favorably with the amount of time required to set up and run a toxicity test or to prepare and ana- lyze responding to both temporal and spatial perturbations.

Only 2.8 percent of the sites did not have a biological impact when the chemistry indicated that freshwater systems since the early 1900s (Richardson, 1928).

Because of influences other than sedimentiater quality, it is more common to observe an impacted community when there is no sediment/quality impact (Type I error .with a null hypothesis of no community change).

Usually, the objective of a benthic sampling program is to study the characteristics of and the variation in the benthic community that specific sampling stations. this case, organ- isms in the sediment at that location are sampled together: those that normally reside in the surface few centimeters of sediment and those that normally reside in the sediment (e.g., S-15 cm below the surface). In some instances, a sampling program may have a different objective. For example, sampling for the Benthic Resources Analysis Technique (Lunz Kendall, box com- sediment (i.e., below the In benthic by gut content analyses of fish captured in the same area) to determine the food value of the benthos. Characteristics of the area under study also influence the type of sampling. In intertidal or littoral environments where sampling stations can be occupied by walking to the site, samples are usually collected a hand-held located in then remote sampling from a vessel is performed using a box corer or grab sampler. Sediment grain size may influence final selection of the sampler. Some samplers (i.e., many box corers) perform poorly in to medium sand, objectives and knowledge of benthic communities in the study area will influence selection of the sieve size through which sediment samples mesh size-s be appropriate for the community under study (e.g., 64 /an for meiofauna, 05 or 1.0 mm for maaofauna). Generally, the chances retaining by the use of a finer mesh (but, see Bishop and Hartley, 1986). However, sieve size is an important determinant of level of effort necessary to obtain quantitative data. Very little difference in the field processing time exists between use of a 0.5~mm briefly below.

Stations that be compared to one another (including reference should depth, and in are estimated in on the sample (including all replicates). For example, the is a less accurate descriptive variable than is the abundance taxa because of the greater variability typically associated with one taxon in comparison with the sum of all taxa.

Within a study area, adequate sample size may be determined species collected or by minimizing the error associated with the mean for the variable in question (Gonor and Kemp, 1978). Additional research on replication is presently being conduct- ed by EPA in Newport, Oregon, under the direc- tion of S. Ferraro (Swartz, R.C., 15 March 1989, personal communication). Power analysis can assist in determining the appropriate number of replicates. values detected statistically, of variability about those mean values) and the power of the statistical test to be used. The power of the test is especially For a specified variance associated with a biological variable, the statistical power of a test and the minimum detectable difference among sampling areas can be expressed as a function sample size. The allocation of resources (stations, replication, and frequency) can then be determined with available resources, approach are found in Winer (1971), Saila et al.

A potential drawback to use of power analysis is that it requires aprbri knowledge of variability in the benthic communities studied. variability and and Holme (1984) and Swartz (1978) recommend that an area of 0.5 m2 be to species single sample pre- Gray collected in the second and successive replicates that were not collected in any of the previous replicates most often will be numerically with sufficient sensitivity can be obtained with fewer samples, or that a greater number is required due to extreme spatial heterogeneity.

Typically, comparisons of one or more indexes are made at the same station over time and compared to a baseline value, or comparisons are made between stations in a study area and stations in a reference area If an adequate number of samples is collected (i.e., three or more), statistical tests such as t-tests or Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ] Multivariate techniques group data and display them on a two-dimensional plot or dendro- gram so that stations exhibiting similar communi- ties are dissimilar communities. The numeri- cal and graphical results can then compared with physical and chemical data collected con- currently to whether represent the degree of function analysis. Bernstein and Smith (1986) developed an index of benthic community change along pollution gradients that is derived from results of ordination analysis. The index (called Index 5) is a measure of change from reference conditions. Benthic community surveys data reduced by the elimination of methods exist for reducing data matrices (see Stephenson el of., 1970, 1972, 1974; Day et al., 1971; Clifford and Stephenson, 1975). Both parametric statistical tests and multi- variate analyses may involve data transformations. Transformations of the original data may be necessary for one or more of tbe following rea- sons: n Benthic data sets are usually characterized by large abundances of a few species and small abundances of n individuals tends Sampling effort may be inconsistent (Boesch, 1977). The two basic transformations and standardizations. without reference alterations that depend on some of the data under consideration.

These comparisons may take the form of so that viui- ables responsible for the separation of groups can be used to determine whether other in sediment quality due to toxic substances or organic materials. The use of different methods and analyses may result in different interpretations of the same data. For example, use of the same data with different standardization methods in a classifica- tion analysis can yield very different results (Aus- tin and Grieg-Smith, 1968). Generally, the more analyses that are conducted on the data, the higher the probability of interpreting the data accurately. should be readily available. Equipment includes field collection gear (e.g., priate sampler, ters or a balance). More specialized equipment includes a muffle furnace for determin- ing total volatile reference and a reference library. Computer equipment and appropriate software are make studies costeffec- tive. multivariate analyses may require the accurate identifications. Some computer programming and some level of data management are usually required. A trained benthic ecologist is the amount of training on and methods are used to analyze benthic data, some of which have their origins in terrestrial community ecology. Because tool, liter- of papers have been written about the method. Several books and protocols have consensus exists 011 best techniques to use within an approach (e.g., widespread use of Shannon-Wiener diversity index, although there is debate as to whether this is a suitable index for environmental Many Each of these methods has shown prom- ise in situations, but more testing and vali- dation are needed before any can gain universal acceptance. Very few assessments of the information gained from analyses of data at the species level vs. the major taxa level have been undertaken. Warwick (1988) evaluated of taxo- nomic data for five data sets. Three of the data sets were of macrofauna (from Loch Linne, Clyde Sea, and Bay of Morlaix); one was of nematodes from the Clyde Sea; and the last was of copepods from Oslofjord that were subjected to different levels of particulate organic material. He reported that in none of those five cases was there any substantial loss of information at the family level, and that in two cases the sample groupings related more closely to the gradient of pollution at the phylum level than at more by species re- placement.\" Warwick's paper appears to be the only published work to support the use of higher taxonomic groups for analysis purposes. In cases where only major taxa level data have been collected (e.g., m and Tetra Tech, 1988), it has been difficult to determine differences in commu- nity structure between States. 92.2 ApplicabiIity of Method Human Health, (e.g., feed benthic in loss of and reduction in value infaunal communi- ties (e.g., see Kleppel et al., 1980), has the distribution of the Astiopecten vedi in commu- nity structure are caused by the toxic bioaccumulation of those con- taminants human health if are ingested (e.g., shellfish contamination), or may indirectly affect human health if contaminants are transferred through the likely that it will without extensive research.

All data are compared on a quantitative basis can be normalized to site them to ratio-to-reference (RTR) values as de- scribed by Chapman et al. (1986, 1987a) and Chapman (1990). The reference site chosen (either u priori or a posteriori) is generally the least contaminated site of those sampled, and ideally its sediment and other characteristics (e.g., water depth) would be similar to those of the other sites. To determine RTR values, the values of specific variables normalized concentra- tion This process normalizes the data so that they can be compared even when, for instance, there are large differences in the units of measurement. The reference site may be a single station (whose RTR value is 1.0 by definition) or an area containing several sta- tions for which data are averaged. The RTR criterion is based but does not depend on the assumption that the reference site concentrations are indicative of reference or background conditions.

The distance between two stations (A and 8) is always partially related to the distance between these two and other stations (e.g., A and C, B and C). Mantel's test avoids the possibility of spurious correlations by two random samples, and comparing the actual correla- tion the distribution random samples.

Second, interpretation of physical, chemical, and biological properties (i.e., interpretation of how these relate to the real environment). Third, it uses a prepon- derance-ofevidence approach rather than the data are considered). Because of the comprehensive nature of Triad studies, additional studies are usually also provides a test of the quality of reference areas (i.e., do contamination or biologi- cal occur?).

In areas where benthic communities have eliminated emphasize the need to use knowledge of an area in making any type of quality. chemicals the in need of remedial action. Pilot studies of this nature have been conducted in Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay (Long and Chapman, 1985; Chapman, 1986; Chapman cl al., 1986, 1987a) and in Europe (e.g., Chapman, in press; Chapman et (II.; in interpreting toxicity laboratory difficult to distinguish that mortality provided organisms and tests are appropriate for all chemicals. For this reason, a battery of bioas- say tests 1s recommended. Caution must be used when sediment be specif- ic to certain chemical classes. Interpretation of the Triad approach can be limited by the organisms in the environment if the in situ effects are determined primarily by the same species used bioassay In other words, all biological effects data are based on a single ln cases, independence tests would include a wide variety all interactions between chemical mixtures and the environment. This method is comprehensive because it includes the measurements of multiple chemicals as well as the approach is as suitable for sour- control as it is for in-place pollutant control.

Although the Triad was not because of other considerations, decision-makers were able to by compare suitability and Does not usually required follow-up when a complete study is conducted.

The concept is straightforward. A high level of chemical and biological expertise is required to obtain the data for the three separate Triad componenls. However, many laboratories or groups expertise. 10.3.2.2 The Triad approach not damage, but it can be used to identify contaminated areas for the potential environmental damage due to toxic contamination and the costs the Triad which predict environmental damage.

In addition, Canada has conducted Triad studies in Vancouver to determine the suitability of this approach for implementation of the new Canadian Environmental Protedion Ad (Cross et al., 1991; Cross et al., in review). 10.3.2.5 AbiIity to Be Implemented by L&oratories with Typical use collected nonsynoptic data to derive results in a and fiap- man, the have not been quantitatively determined.

Urban Bay Toxics Action Program The Urban Bay Toxics Action Program is a multiphase program to control pollution of urban bays in Puget Sound. The program includes steps to identify for source control, and form an action team for plan implementation. Initiated in 1984 by Ecology and U.S. EPA Region X's Office of Puget Sound, the program is a major component of the Puget Sound Estuary Program Puget Water Quality Authority (Author- ity) and other state agencies and local govern- ments. Major funding and overall guidance for the program is provided by U.S. EPA Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds.

It is recommended that a search for existing data be conducted as part of determining the need collecting new samples. The existing database matched biological data from Puget Sound comprises over 300 samples.

Its first application is in a work plan for sediment investigations at Great Lakes areas the IJC). 118(c)(3) of Water Quality Act of 1987 calls for U.S. EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office to survey at least five AOCs as part of a 5-yr study and demon- stration program called a series of activities involving physical mapping and characterization, sampling, chemical analyses, toxicity testing, and in situ community analysis. The assessment began in 1989 and was completed in 1991. The ARCS program also seeks of developing It possible that other Great Lakes harbors, rivers, and estuaries will be added to the list of AOCs, in which case remedial action plans would have to be developed there.

The Green Book contains national guidance for evaluating the suitability of dredged material for ocean disposal; it re- places the guidance of the original manual (USEPA/USACE, 1977) that was published by USEPA and the USACE in 1977. The manual stresses the use of bioassay and bioaccumulation testing as evaluative tools, and it contains tech- nical guidance on the use of such tests. The following is a summary of the 1991 manual and the approach used by USEPA and the USACE to determine the suitability of dredged material for ocean disposal. The manual will be revised at a future date, based on the findings of an EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) review (SAB,1992), and changes will be made to the Ocean Dumping Regulations (referenced below). 13.1 APPLICATION The 1977 U.S. Ocean Dumping Regulations [Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 220-228]. The manual is applicable to all activities involving the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters outside the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured. The guidance in this manual is appli- cable to dredging operations conducted under permits as well as to federal projects conducted by the USACE. The procedures in this manual do not apply to activities excluded by 40 CFR 220.1. It is important to note that the regulations are legally binding and that the guidance provid- ed in this manual is responsive to the specific requirements of these regulations, but the manu- al does not carry the force law. cient of the for disposal. Within the tiers, specific physical, chemical, and biological tests are recommended. regional and manuals to implement the national guidance in the 1991 Green Book (such as using local spe- cies in biological tests for particu- lar contaminants in chemical analyses). 13.1.1 current use The 1991 Green Book replaces the 1977 Green Book. USEPA Region and USACE Dis- offices and the Green procedures dredging issued under USACE permits prior to the completion of the new local agreement/manual for the area cov- ered by existing local guidance. New dredged-material disposal projects, projects that have not had sampling and analysis plans approved prior to finalization of the local agreement/manual, should be evaluated under the updated guidance in the 1991 Green Book. Ongoing projects that have been approved based on 1977 Green Book guidance should be reevaluated according to 1991 Green Book guidance and the new local agreement/manual within 3 years of permit approval. 13.1.2 Potential Use Green be applied to dredged-material evaluations for the foreseeable future. The manual will be revised at a future date based on (1) the findings of an EPA SAB re- view (SAB, 1992), (2) technical advances in assessing sediment contamination and marine changes the Ocean Dumping Regulations. 13.2 DESCRIPTION Analysis of sediment to determine its suit- ability for ocean disposal is conducted accord- ing to the procedures in the 1991 Green Book. The 1991 Green Book recommends procedures that satisfy section 103 of the and Act of 1972 Law 92-532. The MPRSA was enacted to regulate ocean dumping of all materials that might adversely affect human health, the marine environment, or other uses of the oceans. addition, of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention), of which the United States is a signatory. MPRSA section 103 specifies that all trans- portation and dumping of dredged material into ocean waters must be evaluated to de- criteria 40 CPR dredged material is presented in the 1991 Green Book. If the results of the appro- priate tests show that material a designated ocean dredged-material disposal site (ODMDS) is supported. If the test results show that the material does not meet the cri- teria set forth in the regulations, significant environment include negative human-health effects from uses of the marine environment. The manual does not present guidance for the disposal of dredged material burial, and predisposal treatment) that are beyond the scope of the document. 13.2.1 Description of Method Integral to the 1991 Green Book is a tiered-testing procedure to characterize dredged material and predict environment researchers, and is dredged-material and permitting process for new and existing projects. Knowledge of local condi- tions is both recommended and necessary to adapt the in dredging and disposal areas. The tiered-testing procedure in the concentration (LPC), defined in section 227.27 of the Ocean Dumping Regulations. The LPC for the liquid-phase concentration of dredged material in the water column is the concentration that, after allowance for acutely toxic concentration. The LPC of the suspended particulate and solid phases is the concentration that will cause unreasonable bioaccumulation. evaluator exit the testing procedures at any tier. However, to begin the evaluation in Tier II, III, or IV, the existing data must satisfy the requirements of the cases, of LPC com- pliance can be made in Tier I, II, or III. In extraordinary cases, where LPC compliance cannot be determined by Tier III, the dredged material must be evaluated under Tier Tier IV are case-specific investigations of the dredged material at the ODMDS. Significant investment in the re- search and development of analytical methods is usually necessary Tier IV testing. Similarly, an applicant can try to save time and money by proceeding directly to Tier II, III, or IV if it is believed that analysis in the earlier tiers will not lead to a definitive evaluation. rial must comply with the regulations if it be dumped at an ODMDS. The tiered-testing procedure facilitates this summary, the Includes state-of-the-art methods potential impact of is to determine whether the water-column and benthic LPC is met for the proposed dredged material, as defiied in the Ocean Dumping Regulations. decision options are possible as the dredged-material evaluator proceeds through the tiers. (1) disposal option supported; disposal is not sup- ported; proceed to the next tier. (3) The LPC is not met; the ocean or to decide not to oceandump. However, a of LPC noncompliance does ocean actions might be feasible to make the dredged material meet the LPC. Management actions for dredged material that exceeds water-column or bentbic LPC are rrot included in the Green Book because of the wide range of available options and the project-specific nature of such work. It is assumed that the users of the 1991 Green Book are generally familiar with the need for and methods of dredged-material testing. The manual is not a standalone document. The guidance in the manual requires the consult the regulations frequently (40 CFR Parts 220-228 is included in the Green Book as Ap- pendix A) and to have a general understanding of material contained in the numerous citations and references. The guidance in the manual concentrates on data collection and decision points, and it only summarizes recommended field and laboratory procedures that can be used to obtain data. The user must refer to the origi- nal sources for most of the physical, chemical, ysis of existing physical, chemical, and biologi- cal information. For many dredging projects, there is a wealth of readily available information on the proposed dredged material and on the characteristics of the disposal site. This is espe- cially true of areas that have historically under- gone maintenance dredging or have been studies, such fishery area not be sufficient to reach a evaluation, but often there accessible high- quality data an early decision with lowered expenditure of time and resources. Whatever the source of information for Tier I evaluations, the quality of the data must be evaluated and weighed accordingly. The references of data ob&ned from different information sources. If the information set compiled in Tier I is complete and comparable to information that would appropriately satisfy the LPC in Tier II, III, or a decision on regulatory compliance be completed without proceeding be com- pleted within Tier I, the weight of evidence of the collected information must convincingly show that the dredged-material disposal either will or will not meet tbe LPC. Included in Tier I is an assessment of the three exclusionary criteria in 40 CFR 227.13(b): (1) the dredged material is predominantly sand, gravel, or rock from a highenergy area; (2) the material is suitable for beach nourishment; or (3) the material is similar to the disposal site and from an area far removed from pollution sources. If one or more of the above exclusion- ary criteria can be satisfied, the LPC is met for the dredged material and no further evaluation is required. If none of the exclusionary criteria met and the collected information is to provide reliable, rapid screening of impact potential without the need further testing. This purpose is fulfilled for water-column evaluations, but at present for that includes the application of a numerical mixing model. in Step 1, the model is used as a screen; all of the contaminants in the dredged material are assumed to be released into the water column during the disposal process. If the model of contam- inants of concern If LPC compliance shown in Step 1, Step 2 is conducted. In Step 2, chemical data from an elutriate test of the dredged materi- al are run in the model. Compared to the as- sumption of total contaminant release in the Step 1 screen, the elutriate data applied in Step 2 are a more precise representation of the concentra- tion of contaminants that would column during ocean dis- posal of dredged material. If the model predicts in Step 2 that any WQC are exceeded, the water-column LPC is not met (open-ocean disposal not supported). If there are WQC for all of the contaminants of concern, if no WQC are exceeded by the Step 2 model, and if no contaminant synergistic effects are suspected, the water-column in the regulations. 1991 Green Book recommends using the USACE Automated mixing of dredged material at ODMDSs. ADDAMS models can be run on a personal computer with a minimum of hardware. The models account for the physical processes dredged-material Three address different contaminant requiring the greatest amount of dilution to meet the LPC. The models simulate movement of the disposed material as it falls through the water column, as it is transported and diffused by the ambient current, and as it spreads over the bottom. The models have some limitations; for example, the DIFID model will not work for very shallow disposal sites where the discharge time from the barge exceeds the descent period to the bottom. However, the models can simulate a wide range of disposal options. USEPA and the USACE are in the process of field-verifying these models. Appendix B of the 1991 Green Book is a summary of the ADDAMS models; the armput- er personnel at the USACE Experiment are available to supply model updates, answer ques- tions, and assist with the selection and individual models. 13-\"Green Book\" Se&nent-Testing Approach metals. chemical percent interest.

The evaluations in this tier are based on the of the dissolved and suspended portions of the dredged material that remains in the water column after initial mixing. The bioassays are run if the Tier II evaluations are inconclusive, e.g., if there are not applicable WQC for all contaminants of concern or suspect synergistic bioassays are used to calcu- late the &, concentration of the dredged mated in the water c&unn. The LPC for this evaluation is 1 percent environment 4 b after disposal.

At the conclusion of the tests, the tissues of the organisms are analyzed for the contaminants that are identified in sensitive bioindicators and strongly recommended in the Green Book be for three species types stipulated in the regulations. The ecological and economic relevance of the organisms and the practical aspects of using the species in the tissues of the organisms to two criteria: (1) the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Action Levels for Poisonous or Deleterious Substances in Fish and Shellfish Human Consumption and (2) the contaminant levels in organisms that are exposed to the reference sediment. Regardless of the statistical comparison to the reference-material test organisms, if the not met. If the dredged-material results are lower than the FDA action levels and not statistically greater than the reference material level, is satisfied.

Since these tests are case-specific and since they require significant time and money to complete, evaluative criteria must be agreed on in advance by USEPA and by the USACE to determine compliance with the UK. Conducting Tier IV benthic testing is possible with current methods, but the 1991 Green Book emphasizes that this tier is not intended for rou- tine application. Tier tests consume resources of the dredging applicant and the regulatory options and whether to perform Tier IV testing or to consider an alternative that does not involve ocean dumping, role of the regulatory authority is to design tests that lead to a evaluation for the Under FDA action levels and against bioaccumulation data obtained from or- ganisms that are exposed reference- material organisms are from the vicinity of disposal site and analyzed for the contaminants fieldcollected organisms, for bioaccumulation. 13.2.1.2.1 Type of Sampling Required Section of the Book, Collec- tion and Preservation of Samples, provides plans storage. To adequately and conduct a dredged-material evaluation, a comprehensive sampling plan should be in place before sampling begins. Sufficient amounts of sediment and be ccrnveniently handled and transported, but large enough to meet the requirements for all planned analyses.

SC, 2E0 multiple methods have been for broad applications in the United States (USEPA/SAB, 1989; Adams et al., in press). The approach used by the National Status and Trends Program (NSTP) of the National Oceanic with biological effects based on a weight of evidence from many studies. In this approach, the data for many chemicals are assembled from modeling, laboratory, and field studies to deter- mine the ranges in chemical concentrations that are rarely, sometimes, and usually associated with toxicity. The data from many of the studies of the individual approaches described elsewhere in this document to develop informal guidelines by the Nation- al Status and Trends (NS&T) Program (Long and Morgan, Long, 1992). NOM analyzes sediments from numerous locations nationwide as a part of its monitoring program. The guidelines were developed as tools for identifying locations in which there is a potential for toxicity to living resources for which NOAA is the federal steward. Areas in which chemical concentrations often exceeded the guidelines were tests. Environment Canada evaluated development of guidelines NSTP Approach (MacDonald and Smith, 1991; MacDonald et al., 1991). The Florida Department of Environmental Regulation elected to guidelines as a part of its sediment management strategy (MacDonald, 1992). The California Water Resources Control Board will use the NOM guidelines in its initial evaluations of ambient chemical data. Following that step, data from field studies, laboratory bioassays, and Finally, the Inter- national Council for Exploration of the Sea Study Group on the Biological Significance of Contami- in the development of guide- lines for participating nations (Dr. Herb Windom, warrant concern and to identify sampling sites and areas in which there was a potential for toxicity (Long and Morgan, Concentration was presumed that the potential for toxicity was relatively high in areas where exceeded upper of assumedthat the potential for toxicity was relalively low in areas where none of the chemical concentrations exceeded the lower bounds of the guidelines. used the guidelines as a means of placing ambient chemical data into perspective with respect to the potential for toxicity (for example, Squibb et al., 1991 for New York/New Jersey Harbor; Mannheim and Hathaway, 1991 for Boston Harbor; Soule et al., 1991 for Marina Del Rey). The Florida Department of Environmental Regulation has used the guidelines as informal tools for interpreting ambient chemical data and for identifying regional priorities for quality management potentially toxic chemi- cals in ambient sediments; n Ranking and prioritization of areas and sampling sites further with ranges in chemical concentrations; sediment n Range: toxic or always observed. ranges are from numerous in and method are: (1) spiked-sediment bioassays, equilibrium-partitioning mod- els, and field studies and determine the chemical concentrations associated with no observed effects and those associated with adverse effects. (2) Enter the data into a database, including type of biological test performed, effects or no effects, the type of study method and approach, and the degree of effects concentration of the chemical. (3) For those analytes for which data candi- data in is able. Two slightly different methods have been used to determine the three chemical ranges. First, two percentiles in the chemical concentra- tions associated with toxicity were derived by Long and median was identified as the Effects Range-Median (ERM). In their evaluation of the ascending data tables, Long and Morgan (1990) used only the chemical concentrations that had been associated with toxicity (i.e., the \"effects\" data). The conceptual basis for this approach and the three ranges are illustrated in Figure 14-2. Later, MacDonald (1992) identified the three used concen- trations associated with biological effects (the \"effects\" data) and those associated with no observed effects (the \"no-effects\" data). In this method, a threshold effects level (TEL) was calculated first as the square root of the product of the lower 15th-percentile concentration asso- ciated with 50thpercentile concentration of the no-observed-effects data (the NER-M). A safety factor of 0.5 was applied to the TEL to define a No-Observable-Effects Level (NOEL). Next, a Probable-Effects Level (PEL) was calculated as the square root of the product of the SOth-percentile concentration of the effects data (the ERM) and the 85th-percentile concen- tration of the no effects data of these methods is advocated other. The significant fea- ture of this approach is the use of a weight of evidence developed in the ascending tables, In addition to two metbods described here, many others could be applied to the ascending data tables to derive guidelines. The method used by (1992) considered both the \"effects\" and \"no-effects\" data, whereas that of Long and Morgan (1990) used only the \"effects\" data. Different percentiles in tbe ascending were used the ERLs and between tbe PELS and the ERMs was very good, usually within a factor of 2. In both documents, the lower of the two guidelines for each chemical was assumed that toxic no- effects data associated with concentrations of napthtbalene to the ERL and ERM concentra- tions for napbthalene. Long and Morgan (1990) reported the ERL as 340 ppb dry wt. and the ERM as 2100 ppb dry wt. for naphthalene, based on an ascending data table of 49 data points. These guidelines defined ranges of the chemicat below the ERL were toxic toxicity is unlikely below the 81 percent of the chemical concentra- tions between the ERL and ERM values were associated with the toxic effects and 93 percent of the data points were associated with toxicity above ERL end ERM nd above effects-based guidelines that are on a weight evidence reported as ranges in concentrations. The guidelines are based data from multiple studies and research methods, thus providing a weight of evidence. In recognition of the variability in the kinds of data that are available, they presented as instead of absolute providing interpretive tool with broad applicability. They are presented along with all of the supporting evidence in ascending tables, providing tbe user an interpretive framework for comparison with ambient data. In this approach it is assumed that tbe data from all individual studies are equal in weight and credibility, although they may have involved very different methods and test endpoints. It is as- sumed that the methods used by the individual investigators were reasonably accurate. is with toxic those associated with toxic effects. The guidelines can be formulated Approach relies on the use of a generated by the three to the data, minimizing the need for additional sampling. However, evaluation of the regional applicability of the some cases, require further meth- ods are described by Long and Morgan (1990) and MacDonald (1992). 14.2.1.2.3 Types of Data Required The NSTP Approach was intended to integrate a diverse assortment of information into a database to support derivation of numerical guidelines. Consequently, numerous all of these types of approaches. Suitable data were available from a wide variety of sources. While collection and analysis of these data sets were labor-intensive, subsequent, inue- mental updates (BEDS) by MacDonald (1992). All of the compiled data were fully evaluated prior to incorporation into the BEDS to The screening dures to support the development of the 3EDS were designed to ensure that only relevant and highquality were to derive the guidelines. No subjective biases were employed in screening the data; as many sources of data were included as possible. Candidate data from each study were evaluated to determine the ac- ceptability of the experimental design, the test protocols, the methods, and the statisti- cal procedures that were used. Only data in which there were matched measures of sediment chemjs- IANSTP Approach try and biological effects were included. those which either statistically significant biological results were results between samples were mainly throughout North America. jointly Florida Department of Environ- mental Regulation, Canada, and MacDonald Environmental Services L&l. In the evaluation of candidate data from field studies, only those data were used in which at least a lo-fold difference in the concentrations of at least chemical among the samples was reported. Once this criterion was met, the data from many of the field studies were evaluated to determine the mean chemical concentrations in toxic samples (i.e., significantly different from controls) and those in samples with a effect was noted and that there was a strong association between the chemical gradient and the biological gradient. Concentrations associated with nontoxic reference conditions were noted \"no effects.\" Those in which there was no concordance between the measures of effects and chemical with asterisks were used as 'effects\" data by both Long and Morgan (1990) and MacDonald (1992). 14.2.1.2.4 Necessary Hardware and Skills l'be primary skills required to are development of the database. Expertise is required to evaluate the suitability using screening This process requires experience in the evaluation of sediment data and the methods that were used to develop the data. The database has been developed on a personal computer and is readily transferable to other sys- tems, but requires provides a means chemical concentrations to adverse biological ef- feds. This information can be manipulated in environment or exported into other formats. 14.2.1.3 Adequacy OfLlocrmrenti The NSTP Approach was documented by Morgan (1990), in which the approach 'was peer-reviewed both within and outside NOA& A second of the document was issued in 1992, following further review. A synopsis of the ap preach was descrii in a scientific journal (Long, 1992). The approach has been descrii orally in numerous technical and scientific forums. Mac- Donald and Smith (1991) and MacDonald et cll. (1991) desaii the application of the approach in the development of guidelines for Canada. Mac- Donald (1992) descrii the use of Ako, these a visual and statistical intended to the prokction of human life or wildlife. Rather, they are intended provided sufficient data exist and provided the toxicity of the ckrnical is doseresponsive. Long and Morgan (1990) assigned a high degree of a&idence to gui&lines for ckmicals for which data existed Can many different approaches, different regiq and in which there was a good agreement in the data hn different studies. MacDonald (1!392) calculated guidelines only for those chemicals for which there was a minimum of 40 data points, after determining the minimum data sets of increasing size (e.g., 4 to 60 data points) and determining when the estimate amtains fian a wide variety of sediment types, the resultant guide lines are considered to be widely applicable.

The calculations of the guideline values themselves are very simple and quick. Also, the guidelines can be used very quickly and easily. If the necessary data are not available for entry into a database, then the costs to generate them be relatively needed. 14.23 Tendency to Be Cmservative The capabilities guidelines have not been independently quantified. The protectiveness of the guidelines could data from chronic endpoints or applying a numerical safety as was applied in Also, the guidelines would become more conservative if data were included only from areas in which toxicants were highly bioavailable. 14.3.2.4 Level NOAA, following an in-house and outside peer review. It has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The approach has been used by Environment Qnada and Florida Department of Environmental Regulation in the development of their respective guidelines. It has been adopted by a committee of the International Council for Explo- ration of the Sea for use by member nations. 'Xbe State of California has adopted a similar approach to the development of sediment (Imenzato et al., 1991). The numerical use of the approach have been used by NOAA to compare potential for toxicity at monitoring sites nationwide, within San Francisco Bay, and within Tampa Bay. Approximately &O copies of the report by Long and Morgan (1990) have been distributed. Users of the report have compared ambient concentrations of survey and monitoring data., and estimates of ecological risk (for example, Mannheim and Hathaway, 1991; Soule et uf., uses the guidelines in its estimates of ecological National priority List hazardous waste sites. 'lhe guidelines have been used as a basis for interpretation of chemical data in court cases. 14.3.2.5 Ability to Be Implemented by Laboratories with Typical Equipment and Handling Facilities The spreadsheets and database needed to generate the guidelines can be prepared with a personal computer and need not be very compli- cated. Entry of data into the database and the generation of the asending tables are very simple. The calculations of the be per- formed manually, desk-top IIre database can be mented with new data available. the approach can become more the necessary level of effort required in the development of the original set of guidelines was relatively bigh. database would require only a few minutes. Manipulation of raw matching data from biologi- cal and chemical analyses performed in a field study would require from a few hours lo several days, depending on the size of the data set, fol- lowed by entry of the data points into the data- base. 14.3.2.7 Degree to Which Resulfs Lend The guidelines and the ascending tables on which they are based can be used in a number of ways. First, the data from analyses of ambient samples can be compared visually with the ambient concentrations exceed either of the guide- lines. Second, the ambient concentrations can be compared with the data in the ascending tables to determine the kinds of toxic effects The developed thus with account for the effects of factors that control bioavailability of the toxicants. This is not a weakness of the approach; rather, it is a weakness available data. Nevertheless, this wealmess may hinder of ambient with guidelines, The BEDS database includes a provision for entering data analy- ses of acid volatile sulfides and important strength of this approach is that it provides the user some flexibility in the use and interpretation of the guidelines. All of the data are provided in ascending order for the user to see and evaluate. The degree of certainty in the data can be assessed and judged by the user. Ranges in concentrations are provided, instead of rigid, single absolute One of the most attractive features of this the estimation in the BEDS database indicate that only 5.8 percent of the chemical concentrations within the no-effects range for cadmium (0 to 1 mg/kg) determined by (1992) were associated with adverse biological effects (Figure 14-3). These data probability of observing adverse effects within associated with adverse effects. These data suggest is a Evaluation of the guidelines for mercury reveals that a lower level of confidence should be placed on the guidelines for this element.

Confidence in the utility of the guide- lines is inspired by the weight of evidence from these multiple studies. 14.3.2.9 Degree of Accuracy and Precision By iteratively adding and removing different data sets from the ascending tables, MacDonald (1992) determined that a minimum of 40 were develop reliable guidelines. Clearly, the guide- lines is to be expected as data are added or deiet- ed, but, once the minimum amount of data is compiled, this variability appears to minimal. MacDonald (1992) generally doubled or the amount of data in the ascending tables compiled by Long and Morgan (1990) mainly with new data from field studies and laboratory spiked-sediment bioassays. Also, thereby deleting the freshwater data included in Long and Morgan (1990). The effects on the guideline concentrations of eliminating some data and adding a substantial amount of new data are illustrated in Tables 14-1 and 14-2. The ERL and ERM values, based on the Long and Morgan (1990) data tables and the larger MacDonald (1992) tables, are compared by using the methods of Long and Morgan (1990) applied to both data sets. For 13 aromatic hydrocarbons, the average of the ratios between the two sets of guidelines was 1.5 (1.9 for the ERb and 1.2 for the ERMs). For eight trace metals, the average of the ratios be- tween the two sets of guidelines was 1.7. The metals ERL values changed more than the ERM values (average ratios of 1.9 for the ERLs and 1.5 for the ERMs). Overall, 7 of the 23 ERL values did not change and the ratios between the two sets of ERL values ranged from 1.0 to 9.4, Also, 7 of the 23 ERM values did not change. Of the 46' values, 14 remained 17 increased, and that the guide- lines are not terribly sensitive to the addition of new data once a minimum amount has Also, they suggest that the guidelines originaliy developed by Long and Morgan (1990) generally are substantiated by additional data compiled by MacDonald (1992). The accuracy of the guidelines in predicting toxicity bas not quantified. in the Artbur Kill and rarely exceeded them in the lower Hudson River. In a recent survey funded by NOAA, sediments from the Arthur Kill were extremely toxic to amphipods and other species, whereas the sediments from the lower Hudson River were not toxic. 14.4 STATUS 14.4.1 Extent of Use The NSTP Approach is being used by NOAA's National Status and Trends Program, by Environment Canada, and by the Florida Depart- ment of Environmental Regulation. A variation on the approach is being pursued by the California Water Resources Control Board.

Therefore, knowledge of and access to the guidelines was limited. As interest in the guidelines increased, they were released in a government document with a limited distribution. Therefore, the main reason for the limited use of the approach has been the limited awareness of its existence.

First, additional data are needed from studies in which TOC, grain size, and acid volatile sulfides were measured. Second, to establish cause-effect relationships. Third, additional are from field studies in which very strong chemical gradients observed. These number of large field surveys are under way and being planned by NOAA and will lead to additional data to be included in the database. Once these additional data are available, they could be entered into the database and used develop updated guidelines. 14.5 Adams, W.J., R. A. Kimerle, and J. W. Bamett, In press.
