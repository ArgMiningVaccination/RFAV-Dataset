Introduction to unprepared healthcare systems. The virus claimed many lives. So far, the pandemic has led to 93,805,612 cases and 2,026,093 deaths as of 19th Jan. 2021 [ [1](#bib1)]. COVID-19 has indeed perplexed the medical system with its pervasive symptomatology, a and to the disease being fatal [ [2](#bib2)]. As per World Health Organization (WHO), about 80% of infections are mild-to-moderate or asymptomatic; 15% develop severe disease critical [ [3](#bib3)]. Presently, there is no anti-viral specific to options like medications, antivirals, antihelminthics, and steroids have been repurposed for the management of COVID-19 in various phases of the pandemic and studies have research studies are in progress [ [5](#bib5)]. Recently, remdesivir has been widely recommended including the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), but further clinical trials Currently, no other therapeutic agents have been proven to be effective in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 [ [6](#bib6)]. Homeopathy is one of the popular systems of complementary medicine and has been used in epidemic outbreaks in the past. Homeopathy has been used for treatment and prevention in the epidemics of Cholera, Spanish flu, Dengue, success [ is anecdotal evidence that homeopathy was successful during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, in which at least 20-50 million people died worldwide [ [9](#bib9)]. According to Dewey [ [10](#bib10)], the rates for with homeopathy encephalitis syndrome with homeopathy as an adjunct to usual care in tertiary care setups. In dengue hemorrhagic fever, adjunct homeopathy could bring early improvement in platelet count and a decrease in hospital stay by 2 days [ [11](#bib11)]. Similarly, in Acute encephalitis syndrome, homeopathy as an adjunct the institutional management protocol, could decrease the death rate by 15% in comparison to those who received the institutional management protocol the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the Ministry of Ayush, Government India, had the advisory to use homeopathic medicines in the recommends giving homeopathic medicines as an adjunct to the standard of care for treatment of the cases [ [13](#bib13)] in the spirit of the National Health Policy of India-2017 for integrative therapy [ [14](#bib14)]. This study undertaken to explore the efficacy of the adjunct homeopathic treatment to the standard of care in the management of COVID-19. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study design & setting This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind assess medicine in (aged 18 Chirayu Hospital, a designated COVID-19 treatment, tertiary care hospital in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. The ethical clearance was obtained from Central Ethics Committee, Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy, New Delhi (Ref No.1-1/2020-21/CCRH/Tech./23rd EC) and the Institutional Ethics Committee, Gandhi Medical College, and Hamidia Hospital, Bhopal as per the understanding between the hospitals (letter no 13341/MC/IEC/2020). The study was between each This was registered in Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2020/06/026195). The study's protocol has the COVID-19 screened study eligibility. Symptomatic were included in the study. However, patients with severe heart, lung, mothers, and also patients considered incapable to complete the study, or not by investigators were excluded from the study. Post-hoc classification to case for COVID-19 of viral pneumonia or hypoxia. - -Moderate disease: adolescent pneumonia signs of 90% on room air. - adult with clinical signs of pneumonia on room air. 2.3. Intervention In the standard of care + homeopathy (SC + H) group, patients were prescribed homeopathic medicine, selected based symptoms, and given as an adjunct to the standard of care for COVID-19. However, in some cases, as per requirement, more than one homeopathic medicine was required and used after to administer medicine or placebo to the patients. All the homeopathic medicines were prescribed in the centesimal scale of potencies. The repetition of the medicines was of the treating homeopathic following the guidelines of homeopathy for centesimal potencies given in the 5th edition of Organon of medicine [ [18](#bib18)]. Placebo was also repeated following a similar pattern followed for medicine. As an adjunct to the standard of care, patients in the standard of care + placebo (SC + P) group received sucrose globules impregnated from Willmar Schwabe, a practice-certified pharmaceutical company. The medicine/placebo pills were prepared by the study team (DD, and AK). All patients received supportive care according to the standard of care of the hospital as per the prevailing recommendation of the state government for COVID-19. It consisted of azithromycin 500 mg (once daily), pantaprazole 40 mg (once daily), calcium 500 mg (twice daily), Montelukast 10 mg/Levicetirizin 5 mg (once daily, during hours of sleep), Zinc 50 mg (once daily), vitamin D3 60000 IU (weekly). This regimen of standard care was given for 5 days. However, this protocol was modified as the per the symptoms of the patient. Anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic and others were given to patients as per the need of the individual case. 2.4. Outcome measures The primary outcome of the study was clinical recovery. Clinical recovery was estimated through change to rate their symptoms experienced over the past 24 h, 0 being no symptom to 10 being the worst suffering from the symptom imaginable. The score of each symptom was added to the score for each patient. The outcome was assessed every day between 8 a.m. and 12 noon. The secondary outcomes were time to fever clearance and time to clinical recovery. Time to fever clearance was defined as the time from the first dose of the study drug until the temperature dropped to \u00b0C and remained below this temperature for at least 48 h. The body temperature of patients was recorded every 6 h. Time to clinical recovery was the time from enrolment till the total symptom score became '0'. 2.5. Laboratory investigations As admission, all patients underwent for the patients, who did not improve clinically, as per the need of the case. 2.6. Data collection The clinical data of each patient was recorded systematically on a of fever, symptom severity and resolution, laboratory parameters, date of being COVID-19 positive, exposure and travel history, and others as per the homeopathic case recording format for homeopathic prescriptions. All the data were collected prospectively. 2.7. Sample size Considering that this was the first research of its kind in homeopathy and COVID-19, and based on the study team's earlier experience, it was expected that 30% of patients in the SC + H group and 14% of patients in the SC + P group would have total symptom score '0' within 10 days of follow-up. With a power of 90%, and an alpha error of 5%, the required sample per group was 139. Assuming a 10% withdrawal rate, a total of 305 ratio) to either the SC + H group or the SC + P group through a computer-generated randomization chart. One of the investigators, JG was responsible for the randomization of the patients. She was not involved in the screening of patients for enrolment. Once a patient was found to be eligible and consented, the screening physician telephonicallycontacted to JG for group assignment. JG kept a record of the name of the patient against the serial no of randomization chart. Treating homeopathic the study group assignment. The statistician was aware of the group assignment. The overall patient for were identical in colour, odour, and appearance. The medicine or placebo pills to the randomization schedule. In the case of a change of medicine, the vial was replaced with another vial of subsequently prescribed medicine, but the vial had the same number as mentioned in the previous vials. The medicine and placebo were dispensed by the treating homeopathic physicians to the patients. 2.9. Statistical analysis The variables were reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviations (SD), if they distributions or as median range (SD) was used for descriptive statistics and standard error (SE) for inferential statistics. The qualitative ones were reported as numbers (percent). For comparing the variables, t-test Mann-Whitney test used. The qualitative variables were compared by a chi-square test. The analysis was performed on an intention to treat basis. For patients who stayed in the hospital for less than 10 days, the last observed status of symptoms was carried forward for analysis. A longitudinal analysis with the main outcome (total symptom dependent variable, treatment assignment, and times of outcome assessment (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) as between- and within-subject factors, respectively, estimate time to fever clearance and time to clinical recovery and the statistical significance of the difference between the groups was assessed by the log-rank test. The rate of recovery as the cumulative percentage symptom score at baseline, for clinical were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 20.0 (IBM corp., IBM SPSS\u00ae Statistics for Windows, Armonk, New York, United States). 3. Results 3.1. Baseline data A total of 320 patients with RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the Of these, 15 patients refused to participate, patients the remaining 300 patients consented to participate in the study. They were assigned to either SC + H group (n = 151) or SC + P (n = 149). The CONSORT flow diagram of patients in the study is . mean 13.57) years and (41.51 \u00b1 14.27) years in the SC + H and SC + P groups, respectively. About 63% of patients were of male sex, and the sex-wise distribution of participants was comparable. The most common comorbidity was hypertension followed by diabetes mellitus and chronic lung diseases. At the time of enrolment 62.91% (n = 95) had pneumonia in the SC + H group, while 51% (n = 76) had pneumonia in the SC + P group. Among all the patients, 1.39% (n = 2) had oxygen saturation below 90%, 27.27% (n = 39) had between 90% and 95% in the SC + H group and 3.54% (n = 5) had oxygen saturation below 90%, 28.36% (n = 40) had between 90%-95% in the SC + P group. The patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe as per presentation severe (n = 21) patients were comparably distributed between the groups i.e. 7.28% (n = 11) and 6.71% (n = 10) in SC + H and SC + P respectively. 55.62% (n = 84) and 44.29% (n = 66) of moderate patients and 37.08% (n = 56) and 48.99% (n = 73) of mild patients belonged to the SC + H and SC + P groups, respectively. The median time from RT-PCR positive to enrolment to study was 1 day (IQR = 1) in both the groups. The median time from onset of symptoms to initiating treatment was 5 days (IQR = 3) in the groups.

We observed that in the SC + H group, time to clinical recovery was about 2 days earlier than that in the SC + P group (SC + H: 5.95 \u00b1 SE 0.16 days, 95% CI: 6.58 to fever clearance Fifty-six participants had fever at baseline and another 11 developed fever post-enrolment in the study. A Kaplan-Meier curve was drawn to compare the ( [Fig. 4](/pmc/articles/PMC9080028/figure/fig4/) ). We observed that in the SC + H group the resolution of fever was 20 h earlier than in the SC + P group (SC + H: 35.04 \u00b1 SE 6.48 h, 95% CI: recovery and resolution of pathognomonic On day 10 of treatment, 75.50% of patients recovered in homeopathy in comparison to 36.91% in the control group. A graph depicting the trend of recovery between the groups is given in [Fig. 5](/pmc/articles/PMC9080028/figure/fig5/) A. was 8 times higher in the SC + H group than the SC + P group (adjusted odds ratio = 8.36; 95% CI: 4.63 to 15.07; P = 0.0001). After 5 days of treatment, a significant number of patients in the SC + H group got rid of symptoms. The cumulative percentage of patients difference in the proportion of patients in the SC + H group with resolution of dyspnoea (2 = 8.72, P = 0.003); sputum production (2 = 21, P = 0.0001); fatigue (2 = 26.46, P = 0.0001); cough (2 14.92, P = 0.0001) except headache = 0.43, graphs depicting the cumulative percentage of patients, who became free from these symptoms over 10 days of follow-up are given in were for the Arsenicum was prescribed to 9.93% patients (n = 15), Bryonia alba and (n = (n = 96) patients received one homeopathic medicine only, while 36.42% (n patients required two or more homeopathic was observed in 1.6% (n 5) of patients who were shifted to ICU support; of which 1.98% (n = 3) from the SC + H group, and 1.34% (n = 2) from the SC + P group. Among the 2 patients from SC + P group, one had uncontrolled blood sugar and the other patient had a non-responsive fever. Out of 3 patients of SC + H, one had severe dehydration with bedsores, one had a non-responsive fluctuating oxygen saturation. No deaths were reported from both Discussion Our study found that adjunct individualized homeopathic medicine with the standard of care clinical recovery with early resolution of symptoms compared to those who received placebo along with the standard of care. This study is the first of its kind with adjunct individualized homeopathic treatment of COVID-19. As the pandemic progressed and more people recovered from COVID-19, it was realized that post-COVID symptoms one symptom related to COVID-19 [ [21](#bib21)]. In our study in the standard care group, 63% had at least one symptom at the time of discharge from the hospital. However, in the adjunct treatment group, only 24% of patients had any residual symptom related to COVID-19 at discharge from the hospital. Adjunct homeopathy could significantly shorten the time for fever clearance, thereby reducing the for antipyretics. in who received adjunct homeopathy than in those who received standard of care only. It is observed that patients in the SC + H group required fewer antipyretics and other medications for symptom relief. In study, we found that Arsenicum album, Phosphorus, and Bryonia were the most prescribed not a systematic study. Similar findings were reported by Michael et al. illnesses Influenza. In the absence of specific anti-virals, adjunct homeopathy can be a boon for the management of COVID-19 patients in an integrative approach. Homeopathy may be studied as a standalone therapy in cases of mild and cases in future studies. Adjunct homeopathic management of patients on standard of care can be beneficial not only in early recovery and better clinical outcomes but also in the in the SC + H group than in the SC + P group. Nonetheless, objective evidence of the resolution of pneumonia seems to be more appropriate. In our study, we did not estimate the viral load and the time to its clearance. It will be of interest to see the in relation to following number of COVID-19 patients during the study at the hospital, the follow-up laboratory tests of all the patients could not be done due to a resource crunch. Future studies may estimate the changes in laboratory parameters. However, this does not the of the study results as clinical improvement is evident an early symptoms of the patients. Restricted access to patients due to high transmission of infection is COVID-19. Future studies may target to study the effect of homeopathic medicine on these markers and ultimately on cytokine storm [ [25](#bib25)]. Our study being a single-blinded trial, has its limitation due to experimenter bias, as the physicians responsible for the group allocation and homeopathic treatment were aware of the group assignment. Further, the primary outcome of our study there is the treatment group [ [26](#bib26)], however, the patients were not aware of the group assignment. In spite of the randomized allotment of patients to the groups, our study had differences between groups for total symptom score at baseline, patients having parameters. However, the moderate/severe (based on the presence of pneumonic changes in and patients having higher total symptom scores at baseline were more in the SC + H group. Further, it is suggested that future studies need to Keeping in view the evolving understanding of disease and treatment, the team was allowed to conduct the single-blinded study by the COVID-19 task force of the Ministry of Ayush. Further, due to limited access to patient and stressed as double-blind to avoid experimenter biases. The standard of care protocol also evolved with the progress of the pandemic. So, the treatment outcome of later guidelines may be different than the standard of care provided in this study. Serious adverse events were not observed in this study. The beneficial vision envisaged in the National Health Policy of India for integrative of diseases [ [14](#bib14)]. 5.
