As over 70,000 congregate this week, between Aug. 27 to Sept. 4, in the high altitudes of the hot and windy Black Rock Desert, Renown Health's emergency and clinical care for Burners who may find themselves ill and in need of additional urgent, emergent care or hospitalization. This year, people from across the world are expected to make the journey in RVs and cars brimming with tents, food, water, artwork, and temporarily Rock the state's third largest city. \"The Burning Man Project has done excellent preparing participants to have a safe, healthy, and wonderful time building Black Rock City and living on the playa for nine days to nurture the distinctive culture emerging from that experience. However, bringing over 70,000 people together in a high altitude, desert environment with limited access to water, food, and sanitary conditions- always presents a challenge,\" says Brian Erling, MD, MBA, president and CEO of Renown Health and an experienced emergency medicine physician. \"Having excellent care on the playa and plans in place back here in Reno helps to mitigate that risk and ensure the health and safety of all participants.\" \"We welcome every Burner to northern MD, the medicine who heads up the largest Emergency Department at Renown Regional Medical Center; which has the highest-level trauma center for 100,000 miles, located in Reno, NV. Dr. Frey has 23 years of experience in the medical field, and 23 years of experience treating people who have experienced Burning Man. \"Burning Man is a fascinating event, and most people have a great time. However, if things go wrong, they are fortunate to have the BlackRock City Emergency Services Department, 24/7, to help. Back here in Reno, we serve as their 'back up,' providing care as needed, for ill supporting clinical teams when they're feeling Rooms that provide the highest level of emergency and trauma care in the region: Renown Regional Medical Center is the only Level II Trauma Center between Sacramento and Salt Lake City.

Renown Meadows Medical Center includes South Reno's first 24/7 Emergency Room. Located areas such as sports medicine, ultrasound and emergency medical services. A few interesting medical conditions (Playa Foot and Playa Lung), are associated with Burning Man. The Black Rock Desert in northwestern Nevada is part of the lakebed of the ancient Lake Lahontan, a deep lake that existed 15,000 years ago. Lake Lahontan left fine sediments on the lake bottom to form the extremely flat surface. Playa dust is made of both larger and smaller particulate matter. The Playa dust is in the air, on the ground, and on everything in Black Rock City. People combat the dust with masks, bandannas, and colorful respirators to keep the chalky dust out of their mouths and nostrils, but the effort is often futile. Playa Foot is a malady unique to the Black Rock Desert caused by the alkali dust that makes up the desert. It is, in essence, a chemical burn. The best prevention is keeping feet as much as bed and wearing and closed shoes each day on the playa. \"Playa Lung, where the particulate is breathed into the cause of William Graham, MD, a specialist in Pulmonary Medicine and Critical Care Medicine at Renown Health. \"The dust can cause health issues for smokers, children and elderly and people with pre-existing conditions like asthma and COPD. The best prevention a mask that's comfortable with n99 filters, wear the mask as the filters often. Be sure to drink lots of water protection from windstorms. A doctor visit is recommended if any effects of breathing in dust persist beyond a week or two.\" Dr. Derek Beenfeldt is the Chief Medical Officer for Renown's not-for-profit insurance arm HometownHealth, and has been a frequent participant in the Burning Man experience over the years. In the interest of wanting every person to have a wonderful experience while here- especially since over half of the participants live outside the U.S. health care system, he reminds people of the number of free and low-cost on-site health care and testing resources provided on the playa at Black Rock City. \"It is important for Burning Man participants to know that without US health care insurance coverage, the costs can be significant for transportation off the playa for a medical evacuation, hospital emergency department care or hospitalization. Even for people who have insurance, in the past, some have faced some significant out-of-pocket expenses for the flight or transportation or emergency departments.\" He shares the nurses, medical students, and physicians are on site Black Rock City in RVs to provide emergency response and urgent care to participants as needed. Local Hospital Response Since 2011, the Burning Man organization, has contracted with Humboldt General Hospital in Winnemucca, Nev., to staff and equip Rampart Urgent Care, a field hospital that offers X-rays, ultrasounds, a hand-held head scanner, lab single-room wooden structure is easily seen- medics to Rampart Urgent Care services, which is covered as part of their ticket fee. The Nevada State Health Division, Bureau of Health Protection Services is also on the playa. You will know them by the Nevada State Health Division logo on their shirts.
