Homeopathy is deemed a complementary or alternative therapy because its efficacy has been 2018 ](#X0-Gibson2018) ; Fisher, [ 2017 ](#X0-Fisher2017) ; Ministerio de Sanidad, Pol\u00edtica Social e Igualdad, [ 2011 ](#X0-MinisteriodeSanidadPoliticaSocialeIgualdad2011urldate) ], and when it has been proved, its effectiveness is no greater than the placebo effect [Cucherat et al., [ 2000 ](#X0-CucheratHaughGoochetal2000) Howe, Goyer and Crum, [ 2017 et al., 2017 ](#X0-MathieRamparsadLeggetal2017) ; Loeb et al., [ 2018 ](#X0-LoebRussellNeupaneetal2018) ; Zion and Crum, [ 2018 ](#X0-ZionCrum2018) ]. Hence, homeopathy is considered to be a practice based on theoretical principles which are not backed by science, which is why it is also called a \"pseudoscience\" or \"facsimile science\" [Oreskes, [ 2017 ](#X0-Oreskes2017) ]. In Spain, this treatment is legal if prescribed by a health professional, although, as with other alternative therapies, there is no specific regulation on the required training of therapists. The regulated sale of homeopathic products is a special case; this has always been restricted to pharmacies, where homeopathy has gradually carved out a niche for [Pray, [ In not sold on vitamins, minerals herbal which years, homeopathic products were marketed in pharmacies as medicines. At the end of 2017, however, the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices turned down the license applications of the latest homeopathic products registered as such in Spain. Nevertheless, their sale was not restricted. At the time, there was no national legislation allowing celebrated the measure as a victory, it was to be short-lived; in April 2018, the to harmonize national legislation with the European Directive in this regard. [ 1 ](#fn1x0) [ 2018 ](#X0-Salas2018urldate) ]. Spanish politicians have come out against these unconventional Indeed, a Spanish Euro-parliamentarian requested the European Commission EC) to revise the directive and to stop calling homeopathy \"medicine\" [Cabez\u00f3n, [ 2018 ]. EU legislation on homeopathic medicines was introduced in 1992 with the aim of ensuring their quality and safety whilst at the same time providing a clear indication of their homeopathic nature. At the time of adoption of the legislation, it was considered that EU for the safety of homeopathic products, in Spain there is a latent debate on the regulation of homeopathy that, whenever the issue is aired by politicians, leads to social debate and breaking news. It is interesting to note that, since 2017, thanks to a nonbinding legislative proposal on pseudoscience, the country's four main political parties have shared the same stance: there is no scientific evidence to support complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and, therefore, it cannot receive public funding or be included in the public health system. They have even come out against pseudoscience and in support of the need to monitor these practices. Therefore, in Spain there is, politically speaking, no artificial [Ceccarelli, [ 2011 ](#X0-Ceccarelli2011) 2013 ](#X0-Ceccarelli2013) In other words, politicians have admitted that the effectiveness of homeopathy is not a \"scientific\" debate because there is a clear consensus within the scientific community on the absence evidence supporting the effectiveness homeopathic that concerns governance. Although the use of homeopathy in Spain is limited compared with other alternative therapies \u2014 only 5% of the population are homeopathy users [Cano-Or\u00f3n, Mendoza-Poudereux and Moreno-Castro, [ 2018, in press ](#X0-Cano-OronMendoza-PoudereuxMoreno-Castro2018) ; Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas, [ 2018 ](#X0-CIS2018) ] \u2014 the skeptical movement's campaign against homeopathy has gained momentum [Cano-Or\u00f3n, [ 2018, submitted for publication ](#X0-Cano-Oron2018) ]. This type of activism, which is also present in countries such as the U.K. and Australia [Caldwell, [ 2017 ](#X0-Caldwell2017) ; Brosnan, [ ](#X0-Brosnan2015) [ ](#X0-Flatt2013) ; Chatfield, Partington and Duckworth, [ 2012 ](#X0-ChatfieldPartingtonDuckworth2012) ], has been promoted by civil society itself to discredit these therapies. The skeptical movement's discourse to ban to reject pseudotherapies), media (social media users bringing pressure to bear on journalists to get them to support the scientific perspective) and economic consequences (the fall in sales of homeopathic products). Regarding the use of homeopathy in Spain, several facts are particularly striking in terms of the user to access information about treatments [Cano-Or\u00f3n, Mendoza-Poudereux and Moreno-Castro, [ 2018, in press ](#X0-Cano-OronMendoza-PoudereuxMoreno-Castro2018) ]. Friends and acquaintances, who may the network\" [Evans al., 2007 ](#X0-EvansShawThompsonetal2007) ], were the most consulted source, followed by the Internet (28.2%). Nevertheless, this second information source can be inaccurate [Cole, Watkins and Kleine, sources depending entirely user's level literacy [Armstrong-Heimsoth et al., [ 2017 ](#X0-Armstrong-HeimsothJohnsonMcCulleyetal2017) ]. an lead to misinterpretations. In all likelihood, the personal experiences of family and friends have a greater influence on homeopathy users, who may then perform an active search on the Internet to find specific information on the treatment in question. According to the latest Spanish Foundation of Science and Technology report [Fundaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda, [ 2017 ](#X0-FECYT2017urldate) ], 57.8% of Spaniards obtain information about science and technology on the Internet, specifically social networks (43%) and general digital media (34%). Due to the general disregard for homeopathy in Spain, and taking into account that homeopathy consumers have found in the Internet an important information source, this study has the following objectives: (a) to quantify headlines of homeopathy-related three-year to classify the story coverage tone (equidistant, skeptical or neutral) of the phenomenon; and (c) to identify the predominant news genre used in its coverage. The study of the coverage of homeopathy by means of analyzing the headlines of digital dailies during period allow us to indicators on their stance on the issue. Outcomes could help in identifying if these stances could be an obvious influence on public and political debates, i.e., whether there is any synchronicity in the analyzed period among the informative tone of digital dailies, the campaigns of the social movements' anti-homeopathy and the political decisions taken by the government. [ ] Health journalism Science journalism, especially the in establishing the frames and narratives through which knowledge about health medicine is understood and circulated\" [Hallin and Briggs, [ 2015 ](#X0-HallinBriggs2015) , dealing with news stories about pseudoscientific therapies, such as homeopathy, reiki and acupuncture, it is essential to identify how information is presented [Nissen et al., [ 2013 ](#X0-NissenJohannessenSchunder-Tatzberetal2013urldate) ]. In a meta-analysis of the media coverage of CAM, Weeks and Strudsholm [ [ 2008 ](#X0-WeeksStrudsholm2008) ] found that, by and large, its tone was clearly positive depending on the country. More recent studies of the media treatment of CAM in other countries obtained similar results [Lavorgna and Di Ronco, [ 2017 ; Dong and Chan, [ 2016 ](#X0-DongChan2016) ; Lauricella, [ 2016 ](#X0-Lauricella2016) ; Yel, [ 2014 ](#X0-Yel2014) ; Dunne and Phillips, [ 2010 ](#X0-DunnePhillips2010) ], although discourse apparently gaining Flatt, [ ](#X0-Flatt2013) ; Lewis, Orrock and Myers, [ 2010 ](#X0-LewisOrrockMyers2010) ]. 2.1 [ ] Media coverage of homeopathy In the specific case of homeopathy, Steuter [ [ 2001 ](#X0-Steuter2001) ] discovered that the coverage of homeopathy in newspapers and magazines in the U.S.A., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the U.K. was mostly neutral and without \"bias and distortion\" [Steuter, [ 2001 ](#X0-Steuter2001) , p. 4]. In light of this finding, it was understood that their point of view or tone was favorable with respect to the effectiveness of homeopathy. Only 15% of the news stories analyzed in this study presented homeopathy as \"junk science.\" In more recent media coverage of the topic: - According to a study conducted by Steuter [ [2010](#X0-Steuter2010)], the homeopathy-related news stories English-language dailies in Canada, the U.S.A., the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and India, over a 10-year period (1998-2008), were mainly neutral (39%) and positive (38%), while more skeptical coverage, characterized by a negative point of view or tone (15%) or \"oppositional balance\" (8%), was not as commonplace. On the whole, the study confirmed that the media coverage of homeopathy was similar in all these countries, with the only exceptions being the U.K., for exceeding the positive mean the U.S.A., where a greater number of skeptical stories were published. - In the U.K., two studies quantitatively analyzed the state of Corti\u00f1as-Rovira compared the in the U.K. with that in Spain by analyzing The Guardian , The Times and The Daily Telegraph from 2009 to 2014, during which it was claimed that the homeopathy-related coverage of U.K. media outlets versus 17.1% in favor and 11.8% ambivalent). second study, carried out by Caldwell [ established 2007 as a critical juncture. Specifically, it pointed to the article that David Colquhoun \u2014 a university professor and leader of the skeptical campaign against homeopathy in the U.K. \u2014 published in Nature against the master's degree in Homeopathy as a turning point in the media coverage of homeopathy. Articles about university courses in homeopathy had been hitherto neutral or positive, but as of 2007 most coverage was negative. - In Spain, Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and [2015](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015)] , El Mundo , ABC , La Vanguardia and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya ) between 2009 and 2014, concluding that, in general, the effectiveness of homeopathy was clearly challenged in 50% of the cases (25.7% in favor and 24.3% ambivalent). The authors highlighted the coverage of El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya and La Vanguardia , stating that while the former tended to adopt a position in favor of this therapy, the latter was ambivalent in most cases. In terms of the most prevalent genre, news stories were the most numerous, although El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya was again singled out for having published more opinion pieces than news stories. We could be forgiven for thinking that the type of approach employed by these dailies is linked to 2005 ](#X0-CaulfieldDeBow2005) ] analyzed the results and the tone of homeopathy-related papers in PubMed, detecting that the majority employed neutral or positive language when the were mostly in addition to the literature produced by academia, when writing news stories, journalists play a central role in constructing frames [Hallin and Briggs, [ 2015 ](#X0-HallinBriggs2015) ; Stocking and Holstein, [ 2009 ](#X0-StockingHolstein2009) ] and \"can contribute to the public's mental picture of health, related to attitudes \"women journalists, [Arendt, [ 2016 20]. a study was also performed on this issue, in this case focusing on journalists. Here, polarization comprised two factions: one that felt that news about pseudoscience should have no place in the press, and the other holding that it should be covered, but only to inform and warn society [Corti\u00f1as-Rovira et al., [ 2015 ](#X0-Cortinas-RoviraAlonso-MarcosPont-Sorribesetal2015) ]. 2.2 [ ] Media effects of digital news From a communication theory perspective, recent studies indicate that in impact is minimal [Bennett and Iyengar, [ 2008 ; and Iyengar, [ 2010 ](#X0-BennettIyengar2010) ; Shehata and Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck, [ 2013 ](#X0-Scheufele2000) ; Scheufele and Tewksbury, [ 2006 ](#X0-ScheufeleTewksbury2006) ], since persuasion and the transmission of certain frames have the sole effect of strengthening what audiences are already willing to the testing of these theories in the science communication 2014 ](#X0-Jang2014) , p. For [ [ 2013 ](#X0-Brewer2013) ] addressed the construction of scientific media messages can citizens' beliefs, in case about paranormal investigations. Jang [ [ 2014 ](#X0-Jang2014) ], when analyzing the phenomenon of \"selective exposure\" to controversial scientific issues in the digital realm, discovered that, in these cases, the respondents did the \"confirmation bias\" pattern, but that diverged from their existing knowledge. Similarly, Chang [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Chang2015) ] underscored the respondents' greater level of skepticism, because information that contradicted or clashed with their existing was viewed with suspicion and led to confusion. Knobloch-Westerwick et al. [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Knobloch-WesterwickJohnsonSilveretal2015) ], after analyzing how exposure to [Pariser, that contradicted their beliefs, albeit in a very modest fashion. As for the media impact on the public perception of CAM, Caldwell [ [ 2017 ](#X0-Caldwell2017) ] reveals how, since the launching of the skeptical media campaign against homeopathy, the media have tended to criticize its teaching at U.K. universities. For its part, the U.K. government has gone from supporting this alternative therapy to demanding evidence of its effectiveness. This specific confirm influence, although not level (the taking or not of homeopathic pills), but at an institutional and social one. 3 [ ] Objectives and hypothesis The objectives of this study are the following. On the one hand, to quantify how often homeopathy is present in digital dailies and to check if the peaks in publication frequency concur with related political events, and on the other hand, to identify the dominant slant or tone of the headlines of homeopathy-related stories and observe their evolution during the analyzed period (qualitative study). These objectives will be carried out via the main hypotheses of our study: the pattern and flow of publication peaks in the digital dailies analyzed could be connected to establishment politics and skeptical movement agenda issues. What is understood here as a political issue is a public debate or a political statement regarding the regulation or governance of the health system, or policies implemented in this respect, whereas Methods corpus comprises all the headlines of news items containing the word \"homeopathy,\" published in the 391 nationwide digital outlets after that either did not actually contain the term \"homeopathy\" or, when they did, homeopathy was neither the main nor a peripheral issue, this number was reduced to 1,673 news stories distributed as follows: 320 items in 2015; 532 items in 2016; and 825 items in 2017. The headlines were then following Westall [ Lozano Ascencio, Pi\u00f1uel Raigada and Gait\u00e1n Moya [ [ 2010 ](#X0-LozanoAscencioPinuelRaigadaGaitanMoya2010) ], they are the most critical information link between media outlets and their audiences. Moreover, a journalists the chance to indicate from which perspective the story has been narrated. Taking into account the current digital ecosystem, in which people have access to a great deal of information but no time to read it all, they are now more likely to read headlines than body copy, if they read those at all. According to Lozano Ascencio, Pi\u00f1uel Raigada and Gait\u00e1n Moya [ [ 2010 ](#X0-LozanoAscencioPinuelRaigadaGaitanMoya2010) ], visual zapping on dailies, which includes reading most of the headlines, is now the most prevalent reading method. For many, reading headlines is a good way of keeping abreast of the news and being well-informed. Thus, their analysis reveals the discursive sphere that is most accessible to audiences and whose narrative is the most influential. In this study, the headline of each story was analyzed, including the platform on which it had been posted, the date of publication, the headline's slant or tone (favorable, equidistant, skeptical or neutral), and the news genre (information, opinion, interview or others). To identify the tendency of the homeopathy-related news stories contained in the corpus, a manual analysis was performed on their headlines' tone, which was classified as follows: These four categories have been adapted from those used by Escrib\u00e0-Sales, had no bearing on their research topic. Nevertheless, we believe that it is interesting to measure the number of news stories mentioning homeopathy (in some part of the body copy) but without focusing on the topic, insofar as this offers a broader idea of the therapy's visibility in the Spanish media. of sample of 20.6% (n = 344). The headlines of the main Spanish digital dailies \u2014 specifically, those with the largest readership [Negredo, Vara and Amoedo, [ 2017 ](#X0-NegredoVaraAmoedo2017urldate) ] that had published over 30 news stories on homeopathy during the three-year study period \u2014 were analyzed in depth (Table [ 1 ](#x1-130011) ). Since the News Vara and 2017 in general\" as the third most consulted source, El Periodico de Catalunya was also included to this category due to the number of news stories it had published (50 during the three-year period) and because it has and addition to the viewpoint used, this analysis included the type of story (data retrieved from the database and verified), i.e., information, opinion, interview or others, and the publication frequency during the study period. Pearson's 2 test was used to check the correlations between the information trends and the most read digital dailies, the genre (information, opinion, interview or others), and the date of publication. 5 [ ] Results Throughout the three-year study period, the headlines of these eight digital dailies dealing with homeopathy were, on the whole, skeptical (40%) or neutral (33%), while favorable (15%) or equidistant (12%) approaches were less frequent. However, (Figure [ 1 ](#x1-140011) ) reveal an evolution in both the news treatment of homeopathy and the number of news stories published on the subject. While in 2015, 320 homeopathy-related news stories were published and the most prevalent slant on headlines was neutral (44%), in 2016 their number increased to 532, with the skeptical approach (41%) approach gaining further ground in headlines. In light of the results of Pearson's 2 test, there was a significant correlation ( 2 = 33.384; p = 0.000; n = 1,673) between the year of publication and how homeopathy-related headlines were addressed. The temporal distribution of the stories (Figure [ 2 ](#x1-140022) ) reveals a similar pattern over the three years, with August being the month when these were fewer and March and June those when the largest number was published. Figure [ 2 ](#x1-140022) shows the developments that the media deemed the most newsworthy: - In 2015, the largest number of stories on homeopathy was published in April and coverage of headlines was mostly neutral. Specifically, the peak in media coverage coincided with the announcement of the construction of a private hospital in Madrid that would offer homeopathy services (Figure [2](#x1-140022), A). - In 2016, the largest number of stories was published in March and coverage of headlines was mainly skeptical. The coincided with the closure of the master's degree program in Homeopathy offered by the University of Barcelona (Figure [2](#x1-140022), B). - In 2017, there was a peak in coverage between April and July, due to the following developments: - World Homeopathy Day took place on April 10. Skeptical groups took campaigns (Figure [2](#x1-140022), C). Furthermore, the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology report, [Fundaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola para la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda, [2017](#X0-FECYT2017urldate)], revealing that half of the respondents believed in homeopathy, was also published that month (Figure [2](#x1-140022), D). - In May, the Colleges of Physicians of Las Palmas and Madrid closed their homeopathy sections. Additionally, the death in Italy of a child with who had been treated exclusively using homeopathy (Figure [2](#x1-140022), a), received a great deal of media coverage. - In June, the College of Physicians of Barcelona began proceedings against five doctors for of Pharmacy released a statement warning that homeopathy posed a health risk to citizens (Figure [2](#x1-140022), c). - In July, the month with the largest number of stories, the health minister for the Valencian Community issued a statement in which she said that homeopathy was not medicine and urged the central government not to recognize it legally as such (Figure [2](#x1-140022), d). - World place on April 10. Skeptical groups took developments that, despite having a great impact on Spanish law, did not receive as much coverage as the ones described above. For instance, in February (liberals) put forward a nonbinding legislative proposal with the aim of obliging medical practitioners to report colleagues who resorted decided to delegate responsibilities and powers of decision in this regard to the country's regional governments. An analysis of the eight most-read digital dailies publishing the largest number of homeopathy-related news reveals that the was information (Figure [ 3 ](#x1-140033) ). However, El Pa\u00eds and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya stand out because they published the greatest number of opinion pieces on the subject, for publishing more opinion pieces than news stories. In this connection, it should also be noted that ABC only published news stories. As for interviews, they were generally few and far between. Except for El Confidencial and La Vanguardia , publication frequency increased over the three-year study period, exponentially in some cases (from 2015 to 2016 in the case of ABC and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya , for example), with the exception of 20Minutos and Eldiario.es , which in 2016 published fewer stories than in 2015 and 2017. Second, regarding the classification of the headlines' treatment of tone (Figure [ 4 ](#x1-140044) ), El and theirs in skeptical terms. During skeptical headlines became more commonplace, to the detriment of favorable ones, with the exception of 20Minutos , which published a higher number of favorable headlines in 2017. The case of El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya deserves special mention in this regard, as it changed its stance from not publishing any equidistant or skeptical headlines in 2015, to publishing mainly in 2017. According to the results of Pearson's 2 test, there was a significant correlation between the eight digital dailies and how they addressed headlines on homeopathy-related stories ( 2 = 40.886; p = 0.006; n = 475) and the news genre ( 2 = 91.042; p = 0.000; n = However, there was no significant correlation the dailies, genre ( 2 = 6.358 p = 0.704; n = 475). The correlation between the news genre and how headlines were addressed was also significant were found ( 2 = 8.922; p 0.444). It was decided not to perform a comparative analysis of all the digital dailies and their individual viewpoint because some had published few stories, which would have invalidated the statistical conclusions. 6 [ ] Discussion It is interesting to note the increase in the number of homeopathy-related stories during the study period. For example, nearly as many stories were published in 2017 as in 2015 and 2016 together. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that in 2015 homeopathy was still a marginal topic for the media, whereas by 2017 it had become newsworthy. The fact that homeopathy has found its way onto the political agenda has increased public awareness of the issue. There is growing concern among the Spanish government and political establishment about the legal status of CAM, and a general consensus on the need to crack down on its practice in the public health system. The viewpoint of headlines of homeopathy-related stories published in eight Spanish digital dailies from 2015 to 2017 tended to be skeptical (40%), a tendency that increased over the period. For instance, this can be illustrated by comparing the treatment of headlines in April 2015 with that in April 2017, the month during which World Homeopathy Day takes place. While it received no media coverage in April 2015, it of facts, most popular genre, coinciding with Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015) ], except in the case of El Peri\u00f3dico Catalunya , which published the greatest number of opinion pieces. If the analysis of the slant or tone of headlines of homeopathy-related stories were restricted to those appearing in the five digital dailies ( El Pa\u00eds , El Mundo , ABC , La Vanguardia , and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya ) selected in a previous study [Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos, ](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015) ], results would be 15% equidistant (i.e., ambivalent), 66% skeptical and 19% favorable, out of a total of 316 stories. To obtain these results, the data corresponding to the neutral category not included in the study performed by Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015) ] were eliminated from the sample. Thus, it may be claimed that the media coverage of headlines of homeopathy-related stories was generally more skeptical (from 50% to 66%) than favorable (from 25% to 19%). In their study, Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Escriba-SalesCortinas-RoviraAlonso-Marcos2015) ] singled out La Vanguardia for its mainly ambivalent coverage from 2009 to 2014. In the period 2015-2017, 14% of headlines of homeopathy-related stories appearing in this digital daily were equidistant, while most were skeptical (42%). These data confirm the skeptical drift of the digital press. From 2009 to 2014 El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya , for its part, stood out for its position in favor of this alternative therapy [Escrib\u00e0-Sales, Corti\u00f1as-Rovira and Alonso-Marcos, [ 2015 of that it published in 2017 taking a skeptical line. There is no scientific evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebos. any number of pathologies is greater than in placebo control groups. Strictly speaking, nor can it be regarded as harmless when a contrary, scientifically effects. On the the regulations governing the marketing of homeopathic products and the professional training of therapists differ from country to country. For example, EU Member States such as France and Germany have included homeopathy in their health systems, as well as introducing specific official training courses for therapists. Lastly, a business alternative considered a health fraud since pills Therefore, the study of the news coverage of homeopathy in digital dailies, which leaves its mark on social networks and other similar spaces, is an effective way of identifying its positive or negative bias at any given time. In relation to previous studies the effects media scientific [Brewer, [ 2013 ](#X0-Brewer2013) ; Jang, [ 2014 ](#X0-Jang2014) ; Chang, [ 2015 ](#X0-Chang2015) ; Knobloch-Westerwick et al., [ 2015 ](#X0-Knobloch-WesterwickJohnsonSilveretal2015) ], it may be stated that the media legitimize scientific discourses and conceal or discredit those described Caldwell [ [ 2017 ](#X0-Caldwell2017) ] in the U.K. On the other hand, according to the studies performed by Chang [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Chang2015) ], Jang [ [ 2014 ](#X0-Jang2014) ] and Knobloch-Westerwick et al. [ [ 2015 ](#X0-Knobloch-WesterwickJohnsonSilveretal2015) ], individuals are interested in science news that contradicts, in some way, their existing knowledge. The fact that homeopathy sales have dropped, in the midst of this media vortex, and the indignation of the skeptical media coverage, points showed that 50% of the homeopathy-related stories published in five flagship Spanish digital dailies ( El Pa\u00eds , El Mundo , ABC , La Vanguardia , and El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya ) were skeptical. A similar trend has been revealed in 391 headlines of homeopathy-related stories published in eight Spanish digital dailies during three years (2015-2017). Thus, it could be confirmed that the country's digital press is contributing to debunking homeopathy and building a public image against the practice. At the same time, the media's skeptical stance on homeopathy mirrored the central position in the agenda issues, which the political establishment defended during at least the last two years of this study. Hence, the pro-science stance of the eight digital dailies that questioned the effectiveness of homeopathy was intensified during the period increasing the skeptical by 16%, reach 66% total number of the headlines published. This skeptical perspective of the headlines coincided with (a) the agreement reached by the main Spanish political parties not to allocate public funding to CAM initiatives and to issue public statements underscoring the lack of scientific evidence supporting homeopathy; (b) a social debate on homeopathy, mainly promoted by gradually attracting more media coverage; and (c) a drop in sales of homeopathic products due to lower demand [Vigario, [ 2017 ](#X0-Vigario2017urldate) ]. The eight Spanish digital dailies analyzed here shared a skeptical viewpoint in most of its headlines of homeopathy-related stories, contributing to spreading the idea that the sale of homeopathic products was a scam and tantamount to throwing one's money down the drain, due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. In this sense, that dailies have been demanding and public health. Therefore, not only did the media unite in a common cause with colleges of chemists, pharmacists and biologists, but scientists from other fields also entered the fray, lobbying the public administration to ban the sale of homeopathic products in pharmacies and to disavow medical practitioners who prescribed them. In light of the above conclusion, it is evident that dailies have been disseminating signals to public opinion about the end of the lack of the regulatory control of homeopathic treatments, at the same time as policymakers began to take measures to improve the governance of practitioners and consumers. Limitations of this work lie in its analytic assertions. Since the aim here was to analyze manually the homeopathy-related news stories published in 391 digital media outlets over a three-year period, it was only possible to focus on the headlines and not on the body copy. In addition, the possibility of performing a more the remainder of the stories' elements was rejected in the end. In future research, it would be interesting to discover what the public and physicians think about homeopathic treatment and whether it is connected with media discourse, while also comparing these results with those obtained during the period coinciding with the social campaign against homeopathy launched in the U.K. and Australia. This would enable us to gauge whether the level of public rejection or lack of political and social legitimacy of homeopathy was a consequence of the media's endorsement of the views of the scientific community in this respect.
