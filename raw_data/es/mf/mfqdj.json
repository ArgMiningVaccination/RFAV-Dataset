We -- Nicola and Roger -- have arrived here to share in the discovery of Self through communal living. We invite anyone who resonates with our purpose, vision and intentions to share in our journey of awakening at our ecovillage. Our purpose is to harmonise the inner reality of the human spirit with the outer reality of pristine nature. Mindfulness is our way of being in the world. Meditation is foundational to the life of this community. We are attuned to the presence of Divinity within, which manifests throughout our daily lives through commitment to our practice. We eat an exclusively plant-based, wholefoods diet based on what grows here and local environs. Our approach to food is minimal, optimal and sustainable. We love what we have and we appreciate the abundance of what nature provides us daily. Staple foods are banana, papaya, jackfruit, taro, coconut, and greens. We also keep dry-goods such as beans and peanuts in storage. A healthy community is built upon integrity, respect, honesty and we cultivate between one another here importantly contribute to the overall harmony of the community.

In this sense, living as part of a community offers an antidote to the level of disconnect that we experience in contemporary culture. If you have not lived in a communal or intentional space before, then it will certainly require some adaptation to assimilate with the life of the community. Think about your first day, your first week at a new job: you are gradually getting a sense of how the place works and what your role is in the organization. Living in a community requires a very different orientation to living in regular society. The pattern of life is not individualistic, but shared; this requires a willingness to live beyond your comfort zone and contribute to activities that enhance the experience of community life. Everybody comes to an ecovillage with their own unique attributes, perspectives, dreams and of individuals whilst harmonizing in pursuit of a collective vision is the goal of community: it is a balance, a dance, a work in progress to which we are all aspiring in our day-to-day life. For some, finding the balance between 'me' and 'ours' is intuitive societal of these subtleties about the way humans share space can only be understood meaningfully through lived experience. The way of life that we offer here is simple, yet profoundly healing: everybody comes here with a yearning to connect with a more tranquil state of being, and departs with a renewed sense of purpose and peace. Nicola and Roger, the hosts of this space, are here to share about the journey of self-realisation. Ayuda Everybody here contributes four hours of active service per day, six days a week, to the upkeep of our beautiful home in nature. What you spend your time doing in support of the community really depends on your unique capacity, skillset and personal inspiration. Whilst there may be one thing that you are really good at, we all contribute in a small way to all aspects of our daily life, which often requires learning a new skill. Gardening is a priority, as we live off-grid, but there are myriad ways you can express your creativity through offering work on a daily gardening, or syntropic Vehicle media filmmaking Idiomas hablados Bislama: Fluido Ingl\u00e9s: in spacious, well-appointed cob bungalows a view of the mountain and a located beside a river for swimming.

Our ecovillage is a sanctuary for meditation and connection with nature, and we require that all visitors come with a willingness to disconnect from any internet usage beyond the bare essentials. We do have WiFi access via satellite for communication purposes with your friends and family, however it is not a place to scroll mindlessly on your phone. For the duration of your stay here. you will be expected to limit their internet usage to a specific timeframe on weekends.
