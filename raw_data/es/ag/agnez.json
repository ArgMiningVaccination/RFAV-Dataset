Millones de personas luchan contra los males de espalda, los dolores de cabeza o alg\u00fan otro dolor que se resiste a cualquier tipo de tratamiento, y a la mayor\u00eda se les repite que no existe cura para sus dolencias. El psicoterapeuta Alan Gordon padec\u00eda uno de esos dolores cr\u00f3nicos. Acudi\u00f3 a numerosos m\u00e9dicos y recibi\u00f3 diferentes diagn\u00f3sticos, pero ninguno de los tratamientos le ayud\u00f3. Frustrado por los abordajes convencionales, desarroll\u00f3 la terapia de reprocesamiento del dolor (TRD), un protocolo mente-cuerpo que no solo le permiti\u00f3 eliminar su propio dolor cr\u00f3nico, sino que ha transformado la vida de miles de sus pacientes. El abordaje neurocient\u00edfico de la TRD muestra que, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, el dolor cr\u00f3nico se genera debido al mal funcionamiento de los circuitos cerebrales relacionados con el dolor. La TRD logra reconfigurar el cerebro para romper el ciclo del dolor cr\u00f3nico.
