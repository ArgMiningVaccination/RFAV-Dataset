An attempt is made to study these potential associations in a cohort of girls with IPA from our hospital.Patients and methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted that included girls with a diagnosis of IPA from the Paediatric Department of the Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz (Madrid, Spain) between January 2007 and May 2015. A record was made of family and personal history with perinatal data, as well as anthropometric data and biochemical values at the time of diagnosis.Results Out of a total of 76 girls with IPA, 2.7% had a history of small for gestational age. When body mass index was analysed according to modified criteria of WHO 2007/Cole obese at diagnosis. Using the criteria set by the Spanish Ministry of Health, 6.6% were overweight and 18.4% obese, with None of them a comparative analysis between normal and overweight and obesity IPA girls, latter and lower levels of HDL cholesterol.Conclusions IPA girls included in the study do not have a higher prevalence of small for gestational age compared to the general population. Prevalence of overweight and obesity in girls with IPA is not higher than the prevalence in the normal population. Hasta la fecha hay datos contradictorios sobre la relaci\u00f3n entre adrenarquia prematura idiop\u00e1tica (API) y el antecedente de peque\u00f1o para edad gestacional as\u00ed como con la presencia de obesidad y otras alteraciones metab\u00f3licas. Es nuestra intenci\u00f3n estudiar esa posible asociaci\u00f3n en una cohorte de ni\u00f1as con API de nuestro hospital.Pacientes y m\u00e9todos Estudio descriptivo transversal que incluy\u00f3 a ni\u00f1as diagnosticadas de API en el servicio de Pediatr\u00eda de la Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz entre enero de 2007 y mayo de 2015. Se recogieron datos sobre antecedentes familiares, antecedentes personales que inclu\u00edan datos perinatales as\u00ed como datos antropom\u00e9tricos y datos bioqu\u00edmicos al diagn\u00f3stico.Resultados Del total de 76 ni\u00f1as con API, un 2,7% presentaba antecedente de peque\u00f1o para edad gestacional. Utilizando la clasificaci\u00f3n del \u00edndice de masa corporal seg\u00fan criterios modificados de OMS 2007/Cole 2000, un 11,8% ten\u00edan sobrepeso y un 11,8% obesidad al diagn\u00f3stico. Seg\u00fan los criterios del Ministerio de Sanidad, un 6,6% presentaban sobrepeso y un 18,4% obesidad. Un 21,2% evidenciaron insulinorresistencia y un 13,95% presentaban dislipidemia. Ninguna de las pacientes cumpl\u00eda criterios de hipertensi\u00f3n arterial. En el an\u00e1lisis comparativo entre ni\u00f1as con API que presentaban normopeso frente a las que ten\u00edan sobrepeso y obesidad, las segundas presentaban niveles significativamente m\u00e1s elevados de triglic\u00e9ridos e insulina y m\u00e1s bajos de colesterol HDL.Conclusiones Las ni\u00f1as con API estudiadas no presentan mayor porcentaje de peque\u00f1o para edad gestacional que la poblaci\u00f3n general. La prevalencia de sobrepeso y obesidad entre las ni\u00f1as con API no es superior a la de la poblaci\u00f3n de su entorno. Premature adrenarche is defined as the hair and/or adult-like apocrine odour before age 8 years in girls and 9 years in boys. Idiopathic premature adrenarche (IPA) is diagnosed of IPA in the general is unknown, [3](#bib0155) but it is a fairly frequent reason for medical visits, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1. [4](#bib0160) To date, studies have analysed potential associations of IPA with a history of small for gestational age (SGA) or the presence of obesity association between SGA and IPA proposes that malnutrition in the prenatal period may trigger a series of epigenetic changes that would alter the function of the adrenal gland after birth. To this, we need to add the potential impact of the rapidity of of Catalonian girls with history of SGA. [1](#bib0145) However, there is no conclusive evidence that a history of SGA may directly predispose to the development of IPA. This may be due to the existing studies having been conducted in different populations, with different sample sizes and different criteria for the definition of SGA. [2,10](#bib0150) The potential association between metabolic disorders, blood pressure Some studies of insulin resistance with elevated levels is a consistent finding in studies of girls with IPA, but there is some controversy in regards to the association of IPA with dyslipidaemia and high blood pressure (BP). [2](#bib0150) There is also a degree of disagreement on the relationship that may exist in cases of obesity concurrent with IPA. For instance, on one hand, some studies have found an association between obesity and high serum urine more in the IPA population compared with the general population. On the other hand, there are also studies that did not find evidence of hypothesis, 45% of a cohort of Catalonian girls with IPA and a history of SGA progressed to PCOS at a later age. [13](#bib0205) Considering the disparity in the evidence on the association between IPA with a history of SGA and metabolic disorders, we thought it would be relevant to sample of girls that met the diagnostic criteria for IPA. Thus, we hypothesised that girls with IPA would be more likely to have a history of SGA compared to the general population, and also be at higher of and set the following objectives: a) to analyse the association between IPA and a positive history of SGA; b) to assess the prevalence of overweight and obesity in girls with IPA; c) to determine the prevalence of high blood pressure and of changes in lipid and carbohydrate D\u00edaz.Sample size calculation Considering that the prevalence of estimated at [14](#bib0210) obtaining a difference of at least 10% between the general population and girls with IPA required the inclusion of at least 53 girls with diagnostic criteria for IPA in the study cohort, for an level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Girl without underlying disease and not undergoing chronic treatment that met the for and/or apocrine odour years. - - Absence of the larche. - - Normal ACTH levels out We reviewed the records of patients managed in the Department of Paediatrics of the Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz between January 2007 and May 2015 with a diagnosis of suspected IPA, without introducing, modifying or removing any data in the IT system and not entering into direct contact with patients to gather information.

We then performed a descriptive analysis of quantitative variables, calculating the we used the test to verify that the variables were normally distributed. For variables that were not normally distributed but whose histogram had a shape that was very similar to a Gaussian bell, we decided to use the mean and confidence intervals obtained in the descriptive analysis. However, for variables that did not follow a normal distribution and whose histogram revealed a distribution, we use the median interquartile range. For qualitative we the prevalence. We performed a bivariate analysis by means of the Student t test, dividing the sample into two groups for comparison: patients with obtained in our with the results reported in the most recent round of the ALADINO study, conducted in 2013. [22](#bib0250) Of the total of 80 girls that sought care for premature adrenarche, 3 had results in the test that presence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and were therefore from diagnosis was by genetic testing, which suggestive of premature adrenarche, the data in her records was insufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis of IPA. Thus, the final sample comprised a total of 76 girls. Of all of them, 74 had been born in Spain, 1 in Brazil and 1 in Bulgaria. As for ethnicity, 69 (90.7%) were Caucasian, while 5 were of Latin American, 1 of African and 1 of Indian descent. The median chronological age of the sample As the maternal age at menarche, the mean was 12.2 years (11.86-12.54). There was a family history of PCOS in 27.3% of the patients, of hyperandrogenism in 37.5%, and of fertility problems in 16.7%. Only 2 girls had a history of SGA, which amounted to a prevalence of 2.7% ( [Table 1](#tbl0005)). None of the girls met the criteria for high blood pressure. We found insulin resistance in 21.2%. Of the patients in who HOMA with excess weight ( [Table 3](#tbl0015)). Comparative analysis of girls with IPA and normal weight versus girls with IPA with overweight or criteria, we a prevalence of 11.8% for overweight and of 11.8% for is, prevalence of excess weight of 23.6%. When we applied the BMI categories of the Spanish Ministry of Health, [16](#bib0220) we found a prevalence of overweight of study sample did not exceed the prevalence reported for estimated at [14](#bib0210) When we reviewed the literature, we found inconsistent data regarding the association of IPA with SGA. Thus, a retrospective study that compared girls with premature pubarche the to was increase the risk of premature pubarche and other complications in the future. The same of researchers designed a cohort composed of newborns of less than 2, to of premature adrenarche and metabolic disorders. [8](#bib0180) Along the same lines, an Australian study published in 2005 [24](#bib0260) that defined SGA as a birth weight and/or on reference charts [25](#bib0265) found a history of SGA in 35% of girls with IPA. Conversely, 3 studies (one conducted in France, one in Scotland and one in Finland) did not find a greater prevalence of SGA in girls with IPA compared to controls. [26-28](#bib0270) The discrepancies that exist between studies may be due to the application of different criteria to define IPA and SGA, as well as differences in sample size and the population under study. In the study presented here, we analysed the prevalence of overweight and obesity applying different criteria: on one hand, a combination of the criteria set by the WHO in 2007 and the criteria proposed by Cole et al. in 2000, [18](#bib0230) using reference the BMI tables having results based on international criteria; on the other hand, the criteria set by the Spanish Ministry of Health, which allowed us to compare our results to those of the most recent study of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Spain: the ALADINO study. [22](#bib0250) When we pooled the data for girls with overweight and girls with obesity, we found a prevalence and of 25% applying the criteria of the Spanish Ministry of Health. The prevalence found in our study did not exceed the prevalence reported in a nationwide study as large as the ALADINO study, in which the combined prevalence sample based on the criteria of the Ministry of Health (18.4%) was slightly greater than the prevalence of obesity in the ALADINO The study used a BMI above the 85th percentile to define overweight sample and obesity in 31.4%, that is, 65.1% of the girls had excess weight. These percentages were greater than those observed in the Australian general population. On the other hand, a study conducted in the Finnish population defined excess weight of with controls. [27](#bib0275) The heterogeneity of the criteria used to define IPA, overweight and obesity may influence the lack of consistency in the results reported in the literature. At the time of the study, patients overall did not present with changes in BP, 14% had an abnormal lipid syndrome, assessed by means of the definition of the ATP III and the WHO 1998 criteria. They found that metabolic syndrome was more common in patients with IPA compared to controls, a difference that was statistically significant, and that the Similarly, a study Catalonian girls with a history of SGA, elevated levels of DHEA-S and low levels of SHBG (which, according to the hypothesis, are associated with IPA) found statistically significant differences in the ratio of the percentage of abdominal visceral fat to subcutaneous fat, hyperinsulinaemia and levels of IGF-1compared to the control group. [9](#bib0185) Another study by the same research group [8](#bib0180) found an association between a history of SGA and rapid weight gain between birth and age 2 years, which would predispose to and explain the greater percentage of visceral fat and prevalence of insulin resistance between ages 2 and 4 years. The main hypothesis of the authors is that the higher frequency adiposity weight. [23](#bib0255) In our sample, the comparison of patients of IPA with normal those overweight obesity index. This suggests that excess weight in girls with IPA is associated with changes in cardiovascular risk factors. However, determining limitation of this study is the lack of a control group with which to make comparisons. Other limitations include not having levels of peptides associated with the pathophysiology of obesity. We can conclude that in our study, girls with IPA are not more likely to have a history of SGA than the general population. On the other hand, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in girls with IPA is not greater than that in Spanish girls of similar age overall. Last of all, the changes we found in the lipid profile and carbohydrate metabolism of girls with IPA were significantly more prevalent in those that had overweight or obesity. In short, we think that it would be useful to contribute to a larger number of patients from different regions in Spain and the establishment of homogeneous criteria for the definition of IPA, SGA and excess weight with the purpose of Molano FJ, Andr\u00e9s Zallo L, Fornos Rodr\u00edguez M, P\u00e9rez Segura P, Gavela P\u00e9rez T, Sanz Calvo ML, et al.
