SITE DESCRIPTION The 72-acre Vega Baja Solid Waste Disposal Site is located in the Rio Abajo Ward of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. The site includes a 55-acre residential area known as Comunidad Brisas del dwellings and a 17-acre undeve loped, uninhabited area. Vega Baja Site is on relatively flat terrain and is surrounded by residential areas to the north, east and west. To the south, the site is bordered by conical limestone operations as well as native soils, rocks and boulders, were present within the residential area of the site and were up to 10 feet in height. SITE HISTORY From 1948 to 1979, the municipality of Vega Baja offered and used the site as an unlin ed solid waste disposal and open burning facility for commercial, industrial and domestic wastes. An estimated 1.1 million cubic yards of either disposed of or burned at the facility. In the late 1970s, local residents began constructing homes on sections of the uncapped waste disposal area. Two hundred and thirteen houses were built on of now developed area, and in the northern portion of the undeveloped area of the site. During the period of disposal, the site was owned by the Puerto Rico Land Authority. In 1984, the Puerto Rico Land Authority attempted to transfer approximately 55 acres of the property to the Puerto Rico Housing Department. The Puerto Rico Housing Department has subsequently attempted to give deeds to several residents; however, it is not clear in the records which residents hold deeds to their properties, if any. The other portions of the site remain under the ownership of the Puerto Rico Housing Department or the Puerto Rico Land conducted at the site since 1994 under the direction of the EPA and the PREQB. These activities are summarized below. 1994 - Site Inspection The EQB conducted a Site Inspection in May 1994 that consisted of the collection of five surface soil samples samples from the site drainage ditch the Rio Indio, and two groundwater samples from upgradient and downgradient municipal wells. Inspection between June a nd August 1996 that consisted of the collection analysis of 153 samples for Target Compound List (TCL) and Target Analyte List (TAL) parameters. A total of six sediment and five surface water samples were collected from the drainage ditch and the Rio Indio and 2 500108 analyzed for TCL and TAL parameters. from upgradient and downgradient - Groundwater Study START conducted a groundwater investigation between April and June 1998 that included the installation and sampling of three groundwater monitoring wells (depths ranged from 195 to 215 surface) and seven water supply wells. Samples were analyzed for TCL and TAL parameters. 1998 - Phase I, II and III Soil Sampling The EPA conducted three phases of soil sampling activities between April and area, the undeveloped area in the southern area of the site and along the drainage ditch. A total of 814 samples were analyzed XRF, and ten percent the samples were to a laboratory for residences, which were XRF. A total of 283 samples were sent to a laboratory for confirmatory lead analysis. At residences where lead concentrations greater samples at 1-foot depths. a laboratory for confirmatory analysis. 1998 ATSDR Blood Lead Testing The Agency of Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Puerto Rico Department of Health conducted a blood lead study of children who lived at the site. None of the blood lead levels in the children (blood was analyzed from all preschool-aged children at the site) exceeded the Center for Disease Control and Prevention action level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL - the maximum measured concentration was 8.4 ug/dL). 1999 - NPL Listing The site was included on the National Priorities List (NPL) in July 1999 based on a Hazard Ranking System Evaluation in 1999. results, it was concluded by EPA that dioxins were not a contaminant of concern. 1999 to 2001 - EPA Removal Action conducted removal acti ons at two residential properties, 5569 Alturas Street and 5460 Los Angeles Street, and at 5571 Alturas Street where a church building is located. Lead-contaminated soils and trash were between October 1999 of EPA in September 1999. The OU-1 RI included an ecological survey, the installation of seven monitoring wells, and sampling of groundwater, sediment, issued Record of Decision in April 2004 selecting no further action for groundwater. Consent Order In a Baja (operator), Puerto Rico Housing Department (owner), Puerto Rico Land Authority (owner), Motorola (generator), Pfizer (generator), Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (generator), and Browning-Ferris Industries of Puerto Rico (transporter). 2004 PRPs Removal Action In March 2004, EPA advised the PRPs that an unauthorized disturbance had occurred at the site involving the removal of a portion of one of the Trash Mounds on a residential property at disturbance of soils on adjacent properties. Materials that had had been placed in the adjoining non\u00adresidential portion of the site. EPA and the PRPs conducted site inspections, which indicated that the remainder of the Trash Mound (located at 5565 Alturas Street) had been the waste involved was characteristically hazardous. At EPA's PRPs including removal of the unstable remaining portion of the Trash Mound at 5565 Alturas. Both areas were restored by placement of a geotextile barrier and one foot clean soil, which was revegetated. Removed materials were consolidated with those that had been relocated as part of the unauthorized disturbance, and also covered a of clean soil and revegetated. Waste testing confirmed that the materials were non-hazardous. SITE CHARACTERISTICS The majority of the residential of site is covered by densely spaced residences, asphalt roadways and other of the site (southwestern portion) is highly vegetated and is undeveloped. The southern boundary of the site is characterized by the presence of limestone mogotes caves. A multi-lane highway, Route 22, is located to the north. There are no surface water features on the site other than a drainage ditch that runs west-east through the site parallel to Alturas Street and discharges to the Rio Indio located approximately two-thirds of a mile to the east. Based on field observations, the ditch is dry except during storm events investigation). The Rio Indio flows into the Rio Cibuco which flows north to the coast of the island eventually draining into the Atlantic Ocean. The unconsolidated materials at the site represent only a thin layer (generally two to four feet thick) which glass rusted metal. The mogotes located in the southern portion of the site are of the the The surrounding is residential with an estimated population within a \u00bc-mile radius of the site of 2,280 people and an estimated population within one mile of 6,871 people. Th e U.S. Census 2000 website reported an average persons per household of 3.07 for Vega Baja. If applicable to households at the site, this average would result in an estimated population of 657 people living in homes on the site. Some of the residents grow small quantities of edible food scope of the OU-2 RI Field Investigation was defined in the Final Quality Project Plan (QAPP) Addendum and the results were presented in the Final RI Report. The RI included the following sampling programs: Residential sampling: to determine the concentrations of lead in soil, indoor dust, and tap water, and the concentrations of target analyte list (TAL) metals, target compound area and to collect further data on the levels of PCBs Trash Area metals, TCL pesticides, sampling: to and TCL pesticides. Residential Lead As described in the RI Report, lead sampling performed at the site prior to the RI primarily consisted of collection of data based on XRF field testing. The residential lead sampling program in the RI included 55 areas spread across 35 properties where concentrations of lead previous from 12 inches to bedrock) in each of the areas (except at 5576 Alturas where bedrock was encountered at less than one foot). Access was not obtained at two properties, therefore, only 33 properties and 49 areas were sampled. A total of 146 soil samples were collected for lead analysis and submitted, under chain-of-custody, to the laboratory for analysis. Of the 33 properties sampled for lead in soil, 31 were also sampled for household dust and 30 for tap water. Residential Blocks Pre-RI soil sampling in the Residential Area included collection soil were 4 500110 PCB Aroclors (26 samples). The RI included the collection of 46 additional surface soil samples from the Residential Area for TAL metals, TCL pesticides, and PCBs analyses. The goal of the RI sampling was to collect sufficient additional samples TAL metals and TCL pesticides. A total of RI in the Non-Residential, wooded area in the southern portion of the site included the collection of 25 samples (from 10 locations) that were analyzed for TAL metals, and 16 samples (from 7 locations) the majority of this area. Additional sampling was conducted in the Non-Residential Area during the RI in soil assessment. XRF instrument, or until the vertical rock face of the mogote physically limited the potential waste disposal area. A total instrument detected concentrations rock outcrop was encountered, were sent for laboratory confirmation analysis. collected the the collection of 11 samples (from four locations) that were analyzed for TAL metals, pesticides removed the three remaining Trash Mounds during the RI to support the development of the baseline risk assessment. Specifically, two RI samples the existing Trash at surface and PCB Aroclors. Background Ten off-site areas affected by site disposal activities were sampled during samples were collected in each background PCB or bedrock, whichever was shallower. Nine of the ten areas did not appear to have been disturbed by anthropogenic activities. The other area was located within a baseball and the soil samples were sandier, perhaps reflecting the A \"PRINCIPAL THREAT\"? The NCP establishes an expectation that EPA will use treatment to address the principal threats posed by a site wherever Section of \"source materials\" at a Superfund site. A source material is material that includes or c ontains hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants that act as a reservoir for migration of contamination to ground water, surface water or air, or acts as a source for direct exposur e. Contaminated ground water generally is not considered a source material; however, Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs) in ground viewed as source material. Principal threat wastes are those source materials considered to be highly toxic or highly mobile that generally cannot be reliably contained, or would present a significant risk to human hea lth or the environment should exposure occur. The decision to treat these on a site-specific basis through a detailed analysis of the alternatives using the nine remedy selection criteria This analysis provides statutory finding that the remedy employs as of Investigations The following metals from a Trash Mound and from the Non-Residential Area), iron, manganese, thallium, and zinc (in one sample collected from a Trash Mound during the pre-RI study). As presented in the Final RI report, statistical and graphical comparisons of background arsenic, chromium, show that potential risks from these contaminants at the site are not significantly different than those presented by exposure to was the pesticide dieldrin four samples, two of which were Mounds). There were 16 surface soil samples above mg/kg lead screening All sample above 400 mg/kg in the 8 properties had sample results higher than 400 mg/kg in the 1 to 12- inch interval but were below the screening value in the surface There was one property where a sample deeper than one foot was above screening all shallower samples on that property were below the screening value. Overall, out of the 33 properties where RI soil samples were than mg/kg at interval. The extent of lead contamination above the screening level of 400 mg/kg in the Non-Residential Area of the site was delineated during the RI and is bounded by the near-vertical rock face of the southern mogotes. Approximately 8.5 acres of the Non-Residential Area are above the lead screening value of 400 mg/kg with multiple locations where lead has been detected at concentrations above 1,000 mg/kg. Similarly, the nature and extent of contamination within the existing Trash Mounds at the site have been characterized. All Trash Mound samples levels for lead, arsenic, thallium, and iron. For this site, there are properties with elevated indoor dust concentrations of lead: 5570 Alturas (824 mg/kg lead in dust) and 5376 Santa Maria (624 mg/kg lead in dust). Potential that runs thr ough the Site parallel to Three the sample locations located up to 1,180 mg/kg. SCOPE AND ROLE OF THE ACTION EPA is addressing the cleanup of this site by implementing remedial actions to address soil contamination. The cleanup of the site, which is the subject of this Proposed Plan, will provide for implementation of and no further remedial action is taken. This Proposed Plan presents the results of the baseline human health risk assessment and screening-level ecological risk assessment for exposure to soil. As part of the RI/FS, EPA conducted a baseline risk assessment to estimate the current and future effects of contaminants on human health and the environment. A baseline risk assessment is an analysis of the potential adverse human health and ecological effects of releases of hazardous substances from a site in the absence of any actions or controls to mitigate such releases, under current and future land uses. The baseline risk assessment includes a human health risk assessment (HHRA) and an ecological risk assessment. These reports can be found in the Administrative Record. Human Health Risk Assessment A four-step human is Risk and How is Calculated\"). The baseline risk assessment began by effects in exposure populations. These populations included current and future residents and intermittent adolescent visitors to the site who may be exposed to contaminants through incidental ingestion of soil, dermal contact with soil and inhalation of airborne dust for current residents of the site. In addition, potential current exposures to were current airborne dust by future construction and industrial workers at the site. Standard EPA exposure and risk procedures were Lead Children and Lead Model (ALM) were used to risks the assessment site-specific dust and tap water sampling results were used in the IEUBK mode l) to reduce the uncertainty results from generic, lifetime cancer risk estimated for adult residents is 4.4 x 10-5 and for child residents is 7.5 x 10-5. For future RME assumptions, the comparable estimated risks for adult and child residents are 5.2 x 10-5 and 9.5 x 10-5, respectively. Non-cancer hazard indices exceeding EPA's threshold value of 1.0 were also calculated for child residents under current and future RME and central tendency (CT) exposure assumptions, inhalation of dust contaminated with manganese. three that were were identified as being at concentrations that are similar to background concentrations (Golder, 2008 and 2009a). Based upon the determination of concentrations being similar to background, these compounds do not warrant a remedial action. The reference dose associated with thallium was recently withdrawn by the EPA due to uncertainty in the development of the value; therefore, the non-cancer hazard that w as associated with thallium exposure was removed from the risk assessment. If new information becomes available, the consideration of thallium as having the potential to cause an increase in blood lead (i.e., greater than 5% of the population exceeding 10 ug/dL of lead in the blood) to residents living on the site. Based on the potential for increased blood lead concentrations in residents at the site, it was determined that a remedial action was warranted to reduce the potential exposures from lead at the site. Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment A Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment (SLERA) was conducted to evaluate potential and an risk calculation risk a based on the ratio of a selected exposure concentration to a selected ecological screening level effects concentration. A HQ than two contaminants that in invertebrates, compounds was associated with a HQ greater than 1.0. The next step that was followed was to refine the selection of contaminants of potential concern at the site, which is documented in the addendum to the SLERA referenced above. There exposure point concentrations (i.e., through the use 95% upper\u00ad confidence limits instead of maximum soil and Northern bobwhite, at the site were determined to be associated with exposure to lead at the site. Exposure to other compounds detected at the site were determined not to pose an unacceptable risk to ecological receptors, and the compounds do not a remedial objective. A cleanup value of mg/kg was determined to be protective of avian populations that use the site. Summary It is EPA's current judgment that the Preferred Alternative identified in this Proposed Plan, or one of the other active measures considered, is necessary to protect public health, welfare and the or threatened releases of hazardous substances, namely lead, into the environment. 7 500113 WHAT IS RISK AND HOW IS IT CALCULATED? A Superfund baseline human health risk assessment is an analysis of adver se health effects caused by hazardous substance releases om a site in the absence of any actions to control or mitigate these Identification: In this step, the contaminants of concern at the site in various media (i.e., soil, groundwater, surface water, and factors as toxicity, frequency of occurrence, of the contaminants in the envir onment, concentrations of Exposure Assessment: In this step, the different exposure pathways through which people might be exposed to the contaminants identified in the the include, not limited to, the concentrations that people might be exposed to and the potential human be expected to occur, is calculated. Toxicity Assessment: In this step, the types of adverse health effects associated with chemical exposures, and the relationship may include the risk of developing canc er over a lifetime or other non-cancer health effects, su ch as changes in the normal functions of organs within the body (e.g., changes in the effectiveness of the immune syst em). Some are and potential for non-canc er health hazards. likelihood of an individual developi ng cancer is expressed as a probability. For means excess canc er risk\"; or additional cancer may be seen in a popul ation of 10,000 people as a result of exposure to site contaminants under the lifetime risk in the range of 10-4 to to a one-in-ten- thousand a (HI) is calculated. An represents the sum the individual exposure levels compared to their corresponding reference doses. The key concept for a non-cancer HI is that a \"threshold level\" (measured as specific to protect human health and the environment. These objectives are based on available information and value of 450 mg/kg, which has been to be protective of ecological receptors, including avian populations, at the site. To achieve these RAOs, a cleanup goal for soils at the site was identified. The results of the risk assessment (both Human Health and Ecological) indicated that the only contaminant for which a cleanup sites generally is based on the IEUBK model results and the nine criteria analysis per the National Contingency Plan (NCP), which includes an analysis of ARARs.\" Based these considerations, EPA has established a lead cleanup value of 450 mg/kg to be effectiveness, implementability and cost as the criteria, with the most emphasis on the effectiveness of the remedial technology. Those technologies that passed this initial screening were then assembled into five remedial alternatives for soil contamination. The time frames presented below for construction remedial action, to ensure integrity and elements that are discussed below. Institutional Controls All of the remedial alternatives, with the exception of the No Further Action Alternative (Alternative 1) would include institutional controls such none of the to achieve protectiveness. Institutional controls are a common element to each of the alternatives to address certain uncharacterized apply as follows: Areas Non-Residential Area where cover is used to contain contaminated materials will be subject already undertaken will be subject to institutional area post-excavation sampling lead above already been undertaken will be subject to institutional controls, likely via the existing \"Call Dig\" program. The specific mechanisms for establishing institutional controls addressed as of the remedial design phase. More information Institutional Controls http://www.epa.gov/fedfac/pdf/ic_ctzns_guide.pdf Pre-Design Investigation Remedial Design. The where access could not be obtained during the OU-2 RI. Additional soil sampling at eight properties where additional lead concentration needed sampling for comparison to the cleanup goal. Where bedrock is exposed at the base of the Drainage Ditch, no samples will be collected. Delineation and sampling performed when soil remains in place after excavation (i.e., sampling will not be performed if the excavation is advanced to bedrock). In addition, long-term effectiveness. Indoor Dust Monitoring of risks related to lead in indoor dust will be the same for all remedial alternatives (other than No Further Action) and minimized. three months after completion lead sampling identified Option Some the Trash Mounds Area may prove to consolidation, portion of the items (e.g., broken glass, small pieces of metal, etc.). These materials can be consolidated and covered in the Non-Residential Area. Materials that are unsuitable for consolidation will be disposed of or recycled at an off-site facility. Any materials to be sent Surface Water Management and Erosion Control The the site will result in earthwork the active alternatives involve design to provide for the runoff and to minimize soil erosion from covered areas. The surface water management erosion control system will consist of following the remediated areas the for surface water runoff at the site, the surface water management plan is likely to tie into the ditch; however, the specifics of the surface water management be developed during detailed design will control requirements. access properties adjacent Trash M ounds in the that found to extend will also be needed for the PDI sampling, and possibly for the remedial action. Because the Drainage Ditch is associated with the roadway right-of-way, formal access agreements may not be needed from all residences that border the ditch. However, notification be given to owners of properties the ditch in advance of sampling and remediation activities. EPA Region 2 Clean and Green will be considered and, to the extent practical, will be incorporated into the detailed design of the remedial alternative. Some examples of operational that would be are those others. Remedial Alternatives Alternative 1 - No Further Action The No Further Action Alternative was retained, as required by the National Contingency Plan (NCP), and provides a for alternatives. No remedial actions would be implemented as part of the No Further Action Alternative. Although no direct action would be taken, there may be natural processes (e.g., erosion/dispersion, etc.) that would reduce the bioavailable concentrations of contaminants over time. At this site, the natural processes that would reduce bioavailable concentrations reasonable timeframe (i.e., >30 years). Total Capital Cost Operation and Maintenance Total Present Net Worth $0 Estimated Construction Time frame $0 $0 0 years Alternative No. 2 - Removal with On-Site Consolidation and Cover in the Non-Residential alternative the removal be consolidated in the Non-Residential Area prior to installation of the cover system in that area. The final design of the cover system in the Non-Residential Area will be determined during detailed design, but Total Capital Cost $4,350,000 Operation Maintenance $20,000/yr Total Present Net Worth $4,680,000 Estimated Construction Time frame < 1 year Alternative No. 3 - Removal with Off-Site Disposal Alternative 3 Mounds, Area the in non-hazardous backfilled and grade of Trash Mounds and any elevated mounds within the Non-Residential Area, which will be restored to the grade of surrounding areas. Total Capital Cost $23,440,000 Operation and Maintenance $0 Total Present Net Worth $23,440,000 Estimated Construction Time frame < 1 year Alternative No. 4 - Removal with On-Site Ex-Situ Stabilization and Cover in the Non-Residential Area Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 2 in that it includes excavating contaminated soils from Area. However, unlike Alternative 2, additives would be mixed into the consolidated materials, and then the mixture would be placed in the Non-Residential Area and covered using the same cover system described for Alternatives 2. Prior to implementation of this alternative, both bench-scale (laboratory) studies and an pilot study would be required to confirm the effectiveness the treatment and to determine appropriate amendments and gather data to support the detailed design. Total Capital Cost $25,420,000 Operation and Maintenance $20,000/yr Total Present Net Worth $25,820,000 Estimated Construction Time frame year are used evaluate the different remedial alternatives individually and against each other in order to select the best alternative. This section of the Proposed Plan profiles the relative performance of alternative THE NINE SUPERFUND EVALUATION CRITERIA 1. Overall Protectiveness of Human Health and the Environment evaluates whether and how an alternative eliminates, reduces, or contro ls threats to public health and the environment through instit utional controls, engineering controls, or treatment. al statutes, regulations, and other requirements that pertain to the site, or whether a waiver justified. 3. Long-term Effectiveness and the ability of an alternative to maintain protection of human health and the environment over time. 4. Reduction of Toxicity, M obility, or Volume (TMV) of Contaminants through Treatment evaluates an alternative's use of treatment to reduce the harmful effects of principal contaminants, thei r ability to move in the environment, and the amount of contamination present. 5. Short-term Effectiveness considers the length of time needed to implement an alte rnative and the risks the alternative poses to work ers, the community, and the environment during the relative availability of goods and services. 7. Cost includes estimated capital and annual operations and maintenance costs, as well as present worth cost. Present worth cost is the total co st of an alternative over time in terms of today's dollar value. Cost estimates are expected to accurate a acceptance. against the nine criteria, noting how it compares to the other options under consideration. The evaluation of the alternatives in relation to the nine criteria are discussed below. A more detailed analysis of the presented alternatives can be found in the Feasibility Study report. Overall Protection of Human Health and the Environment 11 500117 Alternative 1 does not provide for protection of human health and the environment since there are current and future risks that would not be addressed by that alternative. Since Alternative 1 does not achieve this threshold criterion, it will not be discussed further in the Comparative Evaluation. The other three alternatives can all achieve protection of human health and the environment. Compliance with Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) expected the site, employs institutional and engineering controls for materials not currently exposed. eliminates for materials not currently exposed and the containment area. Alternative 2 eliminates risk solely by relocating accessible site, and employs institutiona l and engineering controls for materials not currently exposed and the containment area. For all alternatives, the institutional and engineering controls to be employed for the currently inaccessible areas are expected to be reliable in the long term, and five-year reviews will be Alternative of long-term effectiveness and permanence since long-term operations and maintenance would not be required at the site to mitigate risk for currently accessible soils. Although the inherent hazard of the lead remains under the cap for Alternatives 2 and 4, the cap is expected to effectively eliminate the exposure failure, however small, would exist, the long-term effectiveness of Alternatives 2 and 4 would not be as reliable as Alternative 3. Further, in the event of cap failure, Alternative 4 would pose less risk than Alternative 2 until the cap replaced/repaired, the contaminants would be less mobile. Reduction of Toxicity, Mobility, or Volume Through Treatment Only Alternative 4 provides treatment of lead\u00ad contaminated will by operation of construction equipment during excavation, transportation, treatment, and other construction activities. Alternative 2 will have the lowest level of short-term impacts since it involves less transportation of impacted materials compared to Alternative 3 and it does not involve the addition of additives and mixing that are required by Alternative 4. Alternative 3 is expected to have the most disposal through the neighboring community. Implementability In general, all three alternatives are implementable since the technologies and skills are readily available. Alternative 2 is considered the easiest to implement since it does not require additional testing and does not involve off-site transport of materials. Off-site disposal determined because there are no disposal f acilities in Puerto Rico that could accept such materials without pre-treatment to remove the hazardous characteristic. Cost Alternative 2 is expected to have the lowest implementation cost since it does not involve off-site disposal or stabilization/solidification treatment. Alternative 3 will have a higher cost than Alternative 2 due to the need for off-site transportation and disposal. Alternative 4 is expected to have the highest cost due to the need for stabilization/solidification treatment of all excavated materials, includi ng the impacted soil in the Non-Residential Alternatives 2 and 4 include similar long-term O&M costs, but O&M component. State/Support Agency Acceptance The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico agrees with the preferred alternative in this Proposed Plan. Community Community acceptance of the preferred be evaluated after the public comment period ends and will be described in the Responsiveness Summary section of the Record of Decision for this site. The Record of Decision is the document that formalizes the selection of 12 500118 the remedy for a site. SUMMARY OF THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE Alternative 2, Removal with On-Site Consolidation and Cover in the Non-Residential Area, is the preferred remedial alternative for soil contamination at this site. This alternative provides for removal of lead- contaminated lead above site of 450 mg/ kg, and removal of Trash Mound materials. Removed materials would be mound materials are present would then be covered with a soil cover system. Confirmation sampling would be conducted after removal of materials to confirm that the cleanup goal has been achieved at the target depth. Air monitoring will be of workers and nearby residents. An option is included for materials that are not conducive to consolidation and cover (i.e., large debris) to be sent off-site for disposal or recycling. Any to in the Remedial Design. The final design of the cover system in Non- Residential Area will be determined during detailed design, would cause exposure to underlying materials. Although the future use of the Non-Residential Area has not yet been determined, institutional controls will be established to preclude residential use of the soil cover area to ensure the cover will be protective. A routine inspection and program impacts inspections immediately following extreme rainfall events within the first year after cover installation). Performance monitoring will be performed to confirm management minimized, three months after completion lead were the where access could not be obtained during the OU-2 RI, additional soil sampling further lead concentration soil sampling lead for comparison to the cleanup goal. The remediation of the site will result design to provide for the runoff and to minimize soil erosion from covered areas. The surface water management erosion control system will consist of following the remediated areas the for surface water runoff at the site, the surface water management plan is likely to tie into the ditch; however, the specifics of the surface water management be developed during detailed design will sedimentation control Access to the Drainage Ditch will also be needed for the PDI sampling, and possibly for the remedial action. Because the Drainage Ditch is associated with the roadway right-of-way, formal access agreements may not be needed from all residences that border the ditch. However, notification will be given to those residents who live along the ditch in advance of sampling and remediation activities. Consistent with EPA Region 2's Clean and EPA will evaluate and seek to employ sustainable technologies and practices with respect to this alternative. As is EPA's policy, Five-Year Reviews will be EPA provided information regarding the cleanup of the Vega Baja Solid Waste Disposal Superfund Site to the public through public meetings, the Administrative Record file for the site and announcements published in the Primera Hora and Vocero newspapers.

New York, New York 10007-1866 (212) 637-4308 Horario: Lunes - Viernes 9:00am a 5:00pm Por cita DESCRIPCI\u00d3N DEL LUGAR Los 72 acres del Antiguo Crematorio de Vega Baja est\u00e1n localizados en el Barrio R\u00edo Abajo de Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. El Lugar incluye una zona residencial de 55 acres conocida como Comunidad Brisas del Rosario, con 213 viviendas y un \u00e1rea de 17 hect\u00e1reas sin desarrollar y deshabitada. El Lugar de Vega Baja se encuentra en un terreno relativamente plano y est\u00e1 rodeado por zonas residenciales al norte, este y oeste. Al sur, el Lugar est\u00e1 rodeado por colinas de piedra caliza conocida como mogotes c\u00f3nicos. Cuatro \"mont\u00edculos de basura,\" que se cree que contienen la basura asociada a la antigua operaci\u00f3n del Lugar, as\u00ed como los suelos nativos, rocas y grandes piedras, se encontraban en la zona residencial del Lugar con hasta 10 pies de altura. TRASFONDO DEL LUGAR Desde 1948 a 1979, el municipio de Vega Baja ofrec\u00eda y utilizaba el Lugar como deposito de desperdicios s\u00f3lidos y quema al aire libre de desperdicios comerciales, industriales y dom\u00e9sticos. Se eliminaba o quemaba un estimado de 1.1 millones de yardas c\u00fabicas de desperdicios s\u00f3lidos en el Lugar. A finales de 1970, residentes locales comenzaron a construir casas en las secciones de la zona de de disposici\u00f3n de desperdicios. Se construyeron doscientos trece casas en la parte superior del relleno sanitario y tierra contaminada con plomo, ars\u00e9nico y pesticidas. Basado en fotograf\u00edas a\u00e9reas hist\u00f3ricas, la disposici\u00f3n de desperdicios s\u00f3lidos se concen traba principalmente en la porci\u00f3n suroeste del \u00e1rea ahora desarrollada, y en la porci\u00f3n norte del \u00e1rea subdesarrollada del Lugar. Durante el per\u00edodo de disposici\u00f3n, el Lugar era propiedad de la Autoridad de Tierras de Puerto Rico. En 1984, la Autoridad de Tierras de Puerto Rico intent\u00f3 transferir aproximadamente 55 acres de la propiedad al Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico. El Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico posteriormente ha intentado otorgar t\u00edtulos de propiedad a los residentes; sin embargo, no est\u00e1 claro en los registros que residentes tienen t\u00edtulos de propiedad, si alguno. Las otras partes del Lugar permanecen bajo la propiedad del Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico o de la Autoridad de Tierras de Puerto Rico. INVESTIGACIONES AMBIENTALES PREVIAS Se han llevado a cabo diversas investigaciones ambientales y acciones de remoci\u00f3n en el Lugar desde 1994, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de la EPA y la JCA. Estas actividades est\u00e1n explicadas en detalle en el R\u00e9cord Administrativo del Lugar. PROGRAMA DE MUESTREO DURANTE LAS INVESTIGACI\u00d3N DEL SUELO-OU2 El \u00e1mbito de la OU-2 de RI Investigaci\u00f3n de Campo se defini\u00f3 en el documento Final del Plan Propuesto de Calidad (QAPP) y los resultados se presentaron en el Informe Final de RI. El mismo incluy\u00f3 los programas de muestreo siguientes: Muestreo Residencial: para determinar las concentraciones de plomo en el suelo, polvo dom\u00e9stico, y el agua de la pluma, y las concentraciones de la lista de analitos (TAL) de metales, lista de compuestos (TCL) pesticidas y bifenilos policlorados (PCB) o Aroclors en el suelo, para fines de referenc ia de evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos. Muestreo de \u00e1reas no residenciales: para delinear la 2 500127 extensi\u00f3n del \u00e1rea contaminada con plomo y para recoger m\u00e1s datos sobre los niveles de PCB y plaguicidas en el suelo con fines de referencia de evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos. Muestreo del \u00e1rea de Mont\u00edculos de Basura: para determinar las concentraciones de metales TAL, pesticidas TCL, y Aroclors PCB en el suelo, con fines de referencia de evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos. Muestreo de Trasfondo: para determinar los niveles de trasfondo de metales y plaguicidas TAL y TCL. Los resultados de las investigaciones de Suelos Los siguientes metales se detectaron en el suelo del Lugar en concentraciones por encima de los niveles de detecci\u00f3n de la EPA basados en el riesgo: plomo, ars\u00e9nico, cromo, cobre (en tres muestras que se recogieron de un mont\u00edculo de basura y del \u00e1rea no residencial), hierro manganeso, talio y zinc (en una muestra recogida de un mont\u00edculo de basura durante el estudio de Pre-RI). Como se indica en el Informe Final de RI, comparaciones estad\u00edsticas y gr\u00e1ficas de trasfondo de ars\u00e9nico, cromo, manganeso y los niveles con las concentraciones del Lugar muestran que los riesgos potenciales de estos contaminantes en el Lugar no son significativamente diferentes a las presentadas por la exposici\u00f3n a concentraciones de trasfondo. El \u00fanico compuesto org\u00e1nico detectado con concentraciones superiores a los niveles de evaluaci\u00f3n fue el plaguicidas dieldr\u00edn (en cuatro muestras, dos de los cuales se encontraban en los mont\u00edculos de basura). En las propiedades residenciales hubo muestras de suelo con resultados por encima de los 400 mg/kg del nivel de detecci\u00f3n de plomo. El grado de contaminaci\u00f3n por plomo por encima del nivel de detecci\u00f3n de 400 mg/kg en la zona no residencial del Lugar fue delineado durante el RI y est\u00e1 delimitada por la pared de roca casi vertical de los mogotes del sur. Aproximadamente 8.5 cuerdas de la zona no residencial est\u00e1n por encima del valor de un examen de plomo de 400 mg/kg, con m\u00faltiples lugares donde el plomo ha sido detectado en concentraciones superiores a 1,000 mg/kg. Del mismo modo, se han caracterizado la naturaleza y el alcance de la contaminaci\u00f3n dentro de los mont\u00edculos de basura presentes en el lugar. Todas las seis muestras de mont\u00edculo de basura recolectadas fueron superiores a los niveles de detecci\u00f3n de plomo, ars\u00e9nico, talio, y hierro. Para esta Lugar, hay dos propiedades con elevadas concentraciones de polvo de plomo dom\u00e9stico. Como parte del proceso se evalu\u00f3 el potencial de las tecnolog\u00edas correctivas para atender las concentraciones elevadas en el polvo dom\u00e9stico. Durante la investigaci\u00f3n EPA OU-1, dos rondas de muestras de suelo fueron recolectadas en siete localidades de la Zanja de Drenaje que corre paralela a la Calle Alturas del Lugar. Tres de los puntos de muestreo de la zanja se encuentran en el Lugar y se detect\u00f3 plomo en las muestras en concentraciones de hasta 1,180 mg/kg. RESUMEN DE LOS RIESGOS DE EL LUGAR El prop\u00f3sito de la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos es identificar los riesgos potenciales de c\u00e1ncer y no cancer\u00edgenos en el Lugar, presumiendo que no se tome ninguna otra medida correctiva. El Plan Propuesto presenta los resultados de la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo para la salud humana y la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo ecol\u00f3gico. Como parte de la RI/FS, la EPA llev\u00f3 a cabo una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos de referencia para estimar los efectos actuales y futuros de los contaminantes sobre la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Una evaluaci\u00f3n del riesgo inicial es un an\u00e1lisis del potencial nocivo para la salud humana y los efectos ecol\u00f3gicos de las emisiones de sustancias peligrosas en un lugar a falta de acciones o controles para mitigar dichas emisiones, en virtud de los usos actuales y futuros del lugar. La evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo inicial incluye una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos para la salud humana (HHRA) y una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo ecol\u00f3gico. Estos informes se pueden encontrar en el Record Administrativo. DESARROLLO DE LA ACCION CORRECTIVA EPA esta atendiendo la contaminaci\u00f3n de suelo existente en el Lugar mediante la selecci\u00f3n de una alternativa de limpieza que sirve de acci\u00f3n correctiva para solucionar la contaminaci\u00f3n del suelo. La limpieza de el Lugar incluye la aplicaci\u00f3n de un remedio que atender\u00e1 los contaminantes del suelo, tanto en la zona residencial (incluidos los mont\u00edculos de basura y la Zanja de Drenaje) como en el \u00e1rea no desarrollada (tambi\u00e9n conocido como \u00e1rea no residencial). OBJETIVOS DE ACCI\u00d3N CORRECTIVA Los objetivos de acci\u00f3n correctiva (RAOS) son las metas espec\u00edficas para proteger la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Estos objetivos se basan en la informaci\u00f3n disponible y las normas, tales como requisitos apropiados aplicables o relevantes (ARAR), orientaci\u00f3n a ser consideradas, y los niveles en funci\u00f3n de los riesgos espec\u00edficos del Lugar. 3 500128 Los siguientes RAOS se han definido para los suelos contaminados de plomo en el Lugar: RAO-1: Prevenir o reducir al m\u00ednimo la exposici\u00f3n humana en la Zona Residencial (incluyendo la Zanja de Drenaje) para concentraciones de plomo del suelo mayor que la meta de limpieza. RAO-2: Eliminar la exposici\u00f3n potencial al resto de los Mont\u00edculos de Basura en la zona residencial. RAO-3: Mitigar la exposici\u00f3n humana al plomo en la Zona no Residencial por encima de la meta de limpieza. RAO-4: Proteger los receptores de poblaci\u00f3n aviar de una exposici\u00f3n inaceptable al plomo usando un valor de limpieza de 450 mg/kg que se determino es protector de los receptores ecol\u00f3gicos, incluyendo la poblaci\u00f3n aviar en el Lugar. Para alcanzar estos RAO, se identific\u00f3 un objetivo de limpieza para suelos en el Lugar. Los resultados de la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgos (tanto la salud humana como la ecol\u00f3gica) indicaron que el \u00fanico contaminante para el cual se necesita limpieza es plomo. El Folleto de Superfondo de Contaminaci\u00f3n de Lugares Residenciales (EPA 2003) establece que \"El nivel final de limpieza de los lugares de Superfondo en general se basa en los resultados del modelo IEUBK y los nueve criterios de an\u00e1lisis del Plan Nacional de Contingencia (NCP), que incluye un an\u00e1lisis de los ARAR\". Basado en estas consideraciones, la EPA ha establecido un nivel de limpieza de plomo de 450 mg/kg que se aplicar\u00e1 a todas las \u00e1reas, cuando la remoci\u00f3n se lleve a cabo, incluyendo Patios o Areas Residenciales, los Mont\u00edculos de Basura, la Zanja de Drenaje, y la Zona No Residencial. RESUMEN DE LA ALTERNATIVA PREFERIDA La Alternativa 2, Remoci\u00f3n con Consolidaci\u00f3n en el Lugar y Cubierta en la Zona No Residencial, es la alternativa de limpieza preferida para la contaminaci\u00f3n del suelo en este Lugar. Esta alternativa contempla la excavaci\u00f3n de suelos contaminados con plomo en el \u00c1rea de Residencias y la Zanja de Drenaje donde las concentraciones de plomo est\u00e1n por encima de la meta de limpieza del Lugar de 450 mg/kg, y la remoci\u00f3n del material de los Mont\u00edculos de Basura. Los materiales extra\u00eddos se transportar\u00e1n a la zona no residencial y se consolidaran. Todos los patios residenciales donde se lleva a cabo la excavaci\u00f3n se rellenar\u00e1n y volver\u00e1n a sembrar para restablecer la condici\u00f3n anterior a la excavaci\u00f3n. Aproximadamente 8.5 cuerdas de la zona no residencial del suelo donde las concentraciones de plomo est\u00e1n por encima de la meta de limpieza del Lugar y/o est\u00e1n presentes materiales de los mont\u00edculos de basura se cubrir\u00e1n con un sistema de cubierta del suelo. Se llevar\u00e1 a cabo el muestreo de confirmaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de la remoci\u00f3n de los materiales para confirmar que la meta de limpieza se ha alcanzado a la profundidad deseada. El monitoreo del aire ser\u00e1 necesario durante la construcci\u00f3n para garantizar la protecci\u00f3n de los trabajadores y residentes cercanos. Se incluye una opci\u00f3n para los materiales que no son conducentes a la consolidaci\u00f3n y la cubierta (es decir, residuos de grandes dimensiones) para ser enviadas fuera del Lugar para disposici\u00f3n o reciclaje. Cualquier material que se env\u00ede fuera del Lugar para su disposici\u00f3n se analizar\u00e1 para un posible reciclaje seg\u00fan sea apropiado; dichos materiales se descontaminar\u00e1n antes de su reciclaje cuando sea necesario. Los materiales enviados fuera del Lugar se clasificar\u00e1n, basados en las caracter\u00edsticas de peligro, antes de su remoci\u00f3n. El enfoque para la aplicaci\u00f3n de esta opci\u00f3n se mostrar\u00e1 con mayor detalle en el Dise\u00f1o de la Acci\u00f3n Correctiva. El dise\u00f1o final del sistema de cubierta en la Zona No Residencial se determinar\u00e1 durante el dise\u00f1o detallado, pero se anticipa que va a incluir una capa de geotextil no\u00adtejido debajo de 12 pulgadas de tierra limpia. El suelo se cubrir\u00e1 de vegetaci\u00f3n para evita r la erosi\u00f3n que causar\u00eda la exposici\u00f3n a los materiales subyacentes. Aunque el uso futuro de la zona no r esidencial a\u00fan no ha sido determinado, se establecer\u00e1n controles institucionales para evitar el uso residencial sobre la cubierta del suelo en el \u00e1rea para asegurar que la cubierta dar\u00e1 protecci\u00f3n. Una inspecci\u00f3n de rutina y programa de mantenimiento espec\u00edfico proporcionar\u00e1n para la identificaci\u00f3n de los impactos negativos de fen\u00f3m enos meteorol\u00f3gicos severos. El programa de monitoreo se dise\u00f1ar\u00e1 para incluir tanto, las inspecciones de rutina ya se\u00f1aladas (por ejemplo, anuales), y las peri\u00f3dicas movidas por los eventos por ejemplo, inspecciones que procedan inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de lluvias extremas dentro del primer a\u00f1o de la instalaci\u00f3n de la cubierta). La supervisi\u00f3n del rendimiento se llevar\u00e1 a cabo para confirmar la eficacia a largo plazo. Esta alternativa incluir\u00e1 controles institucionales para atender ciertas \u00e1reas no caracterizadas debajo de estructuras y pavimentos. Adem\u00e1s, se establecer\u00e1n los controles institucionales para evitar que ocurran disturbios en la cubierta del suelo. El manejo de los riesgos relacionados con plomo en el polvo dom\u00e9stico incluir\u00e1 controles de ingenier\u00eda durante las actividades remediativas para minimizar la migraci\u00f3n del plomo en el polvo fugitivo hacia los hogares, muestreo de confirmaci\u00f3n tres meses despu\u00e9s de completar el remedio seleccionado en las dos propiedades donde se midieron los niveles elevados de plomo en el polvo dom\u00e9stico en el OU-2 RI. 4 500129 Se requerir\u00e1 una investigaci\u00f3n adicional antes del Dise\u00f1o de Acci\u00f3n Correctiva incluyendo la medici\u00f3n detallada de caracter\u00edsticas y la topograf\u00eda de la propiedad, el muestreo de suelos a dos propiedades donde el acceso no se pudo obtener durante el RI de OU-2, muestreo adicional en ocho propiedades donde se necesita m\u00e1s datos sobre la concentraci\u00f3n de plomo para el dise\u00f1o de apoyo y de suelo, muestreo de la Zanja de Drenaje para plomo para la comparaci\u00f3n con el objetivo de limpieza. Dado que la alternativa seleccionada envuelve la alteraci\u00f3n de suelo, se desarrollar\u00e1 un plan de manejo de las aguas superficiales durante el dise\u00f1o correctivo para establecer el control efectivo de la escorrent\u00eda superficial del agua y reducir al m\u00ednimo la erosi\u00f3n del suelo de las zonas cubiertas. El manejo del agua superficial y el sistema de control de la erosi\u00f3n consistir\u00e1 de los siguientes componentes: Un plan de nivelaci\u00f3n que mantenga los grados existentes siempre que sea viable y se integre la topograf\u00eda de la superficie final en las \u00e1reas remediadas con las \u00e1reas circundantes. El uso de las pistas, bermas, canales, y la superficie usando vegetaci\u00f3n natural y/o de materiales sint\u00e9ticos (por ejemplo, cerca de limo) para transmitir el escurrimiento superficial del agua en la zona no residencial y para proporcionar protecci\u00f3n contra la erosi\u00f3n. Debido a que la Zanja de Drenaje paralela a la Calle Alturas en la actualidad proporciona la v\u00eda de drenaje principal para la escorrent\u00eda de las aguas superficiales en el Lugar, es probable que el plan de manejo del agua superficial est\u00e9 relacionados con la zanja, sin embargo, los detalles del sistema de manejo del agua de superficie, se desarrollar\u00e1n en el dise\u00f1o detallado y cumplir\u00e1 con la requisitos de erosi\u00f3n del suelo y los de sedimentaci\u00f3n en Puerto Rico. Los acuerdos de acceso se obtendr\u00e1n de los due\u00f1os de las propiedades privadas. Ad em\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n se buscar\u00e1n los acuerdos de acceso en l as propiedades adyacentes a las zonas donde las actividades de recuperaci\u00f3n se llevar\u00e1n a cabo. El acceso a la Zanja de Drenaje tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 necesario para la toma de muestras PDI, y posiblemente para las medidas correctivas. Debido a que la Zanja de Drenaje se asocia con el derecho de paso, quiz\u00e1s no se necesiten los acuerdos formales de acceso de todas las residencias que bordean la zanja. Sin embargo, la notificaci\u00f3n se le dar\u00e1 a los residentes que viven a lo largo de la zanja antes de la toma de muestras y actividades correctivas. De acuerdo con la pol\u00edtica de Limpieza Verde de la EPA Regi\u00f3n 2, la EPA evaluar\u00e1 y tratar\u00e1 de aplicar tecnolog\u00edas y pr\u00e1cticas sostenibles con respecto a esta alternativa. Como es la pol\u00edtica de la EPA, la Revisi\u00f3n a los 5 a \u00f1os se llevar\u00e1 a cabo para garantizar la integridad y eficacia del remedio seleccionado.

Nuevamente, muchas gracias a todos por sacar de su tiempo y compartir con nosotros esta noche. Nosotros vamos a estar esta noche hablando un poco sobre el estatus de la investigaci\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n en el \"superfund site\" aqu\u00ed, en la comunidad de Brisas del Rosario, d\u00e1ndoles un \"update\" y explicando los pr\u00f3ximos pasos y el plan propuesto para atender la remediaci\u00f3n. Una excelente oportunidad para aclarar preguntas. Habemos bastantes compa\u00f1eros aqu\u00ed, esta noche, para ayudarnos a entender en qu\u00e9 estatus nos encontramos, cu\u00e1les son los FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 5001476 pr\u00f3ximos pasos y en qu\u00e9 consiste el plan propuesto. Si me ayudas por aqu\u00ed, Rub\u00e9n... La agenda de esta noche, vamos a tener la bienvenida, pues, que nos la dio Brenda. Vamos a hablar un poco sobre el proceso de superfondo. Nancy nos va a estar hablando sobre la historia del lugar, en d\u00f3nde nos encontramos actualmente con respecto a la investigaci\u00f3n remedial y la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo, cu\u00e1les son los resultados y las conclusiones de estos estudios que se han estado llevando acabo aqu\u00ed por unos cuantos a\u00f1os, el estudio de viabilidad y las alternativas que se han evaluado para atender la contaminaci\u00f3n que se encontr\u00f3 en el sitio y los pr\u00f3ximos pasos. En resumen, nos va a estar hablando sobre el plan propuesto de c\u00f3mo se propone atender la contaminaci\u00f3n que se ha encontrado en el \u00e1rea. Yo les voy a hablar un poco sobre el proceso de superfondo. Como ustedes saben, esto pro... nosotros hemos estado involucrados en un proceso de investigaci\u00f3n de la situaci\u00f3n presente aqu\u00ed, en el lugar de Brisas del Rosario por unos cuantos a\u00f1os. El proceso de superfondo de un lugar gen\u00e9rico comienza con el descubrimiento del lugar. El descubrimiento del lugar, pues, normalmente, se da a cabo... se lleva a cabo de varias maneras, ya sea porque recibimos querellas ciudadanas, porque hay un referido por parte de alguna agencia estatal, porque personal de nosotros visit\u00f3 un lugar y encontr\u00f3 algunas FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 5001487 cosas que pudiesen ser de preocupaci\u00f3n sobre la presencia de materiales peligrosos y, una vez uno descubre este lugar, pues, eval\u00faa la informaci\u00f3n que tiene a la mano para determinar si, bajo el proceso de superfondo, el lugar amerita ser considerado. Si la informaci\u00f3n que tenemos a la mano nos lleva a que el lugar s\u00ed puede presentar un problema, se hace un estudio preliminar, una evaluaci\u00f3n preliminar y una inspecci\u00f3n del lugar y lo que b\u00e1sicamente se utiliza es informaci\u00f3n existente para determinar si el lugar debe ser considerado para ser incluido en lo que se conoce como la lista nacional de prioridades. La lista nacional de prioridades es el \"hit parade\" de lugares contaminados. O sea, es un lugar en donde, pues, se encuentra una contaminaci\u00f3n. Esto es un proceso riguroso, una vez uno consigue informaci\u00f3n que sugiere que un lugar pueda estar contaminado, bajo un proceso de evaluaci\u00f3n y va a un panel, el cual considera la informaci\u00f3n y determina si, de hecho, este lugar debe ser incluido en la lista nacional de prioridades. Estos pasos ya nosotros los hemos andado para el lugar de superfondo aqu\u00ed, en Brisas del Rosario, se los estoy discutiendo a modo de trasfondo para que entiendan qu\u00e9 se ha hecho a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os en este lugar. Una vez el lugar es incluido en la lista nacional de FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 5001498 prioridades, nosotros procedemos a hacer una investigaci\u00f3n remedial y un estudio de viabilidad. Estos son los dos pasos que se completaron para el lugar de superfondo de Vega Baja. Este estudio est\u00e1 dirigido a evaluar la naturaleza y la extensi\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n: qu\u00e9 tipo de contaminantes est\u00e1n presentes. Es d\u00f3nde se encuentran estos contaminantes. Y se utiliza esta informaci\u00f3n para establecer si existe contaminaci\u00f3n y si esa contaminaci\u00f3n presenta un riesgo a la salud p\u00fablica y al medioambiente. Y nosotros, a base del riesgo que puede presentar a la salud p\u00fablica y el medio ambiente, tomamos una decisi\u00f3n si, de hecho, existe la necesidad de llevar a cabo alg\u00fan tipo de limpieza o alguna actividad remedial para atender esta contaminaci\u00f3n. De ser necesario, comenzamos a desarrollar alternativas para poder trabajar con esta contaminaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 presente en el lugar. Estas alternativas se eval\u00faan, se eval\u00faa la viabilidad de poder implementar estas diferentes alternativas y eso es lo que, en bloque, se conoce como el estudio de viabilidad. Estos dos pasos se acaban de completar para este lugar. Se evalu\u00f3 la naturaleza y la extensi\u00f3n o se defini\u00f3 la naturaleza y la extensi\u00f3n de la contaminaci\u00f3n, se evalu\u00f3 el riesgo y se evaluaron las alternativas para atender la contaminaci\u00f3n que se encuentra presente. Nancy, m\u00e1s adelante, lo que va a hacer es que va a ir FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 5001509 por encima de las conclusiones de estos estudios, para que ustedes puedan entender el tipo de contaminaci\u00f3n que se encontr\u00f3 y las alternativas que se est\u00e1n proponiendo, que la agencia est\u00e1 proponiendo llevar a cabo para atender esta contaminaci\u00f3n. Pr\u00f3ximo paso. La agencia provee esta informaci\u00f3n a la comunidad y al p\u00fablico, para que ustedes tengan una oportunidad no tan s\u00f3lo de conocerla, sino de poder expresar cualquier comentario que ustedes puedan tener antes de tomar una decisi\u00f3n aqu\u00ed. Y eso es lo que estamos haciendo en este per\u00edodo de comentarios p\u00fablicos, que termina en el mes de agosto. Y esta reuni\u00f3n p\u00fablica es una oportunidad que nosotros tenemos para poder sentarnos con ustedes, compartir la informaci\u00f3n que nosotros hemos recopilado y que ustedes puedan entender qu\u00e9 es esta informaci\u00f3n, qu\u00e9 quiere decir esta informaci\u00f3n y cu\u00e1les son los planes que se est\u00e1n proponiendo hacer. Una vez nosotros culminemos este proceso de comentarios p\u00fablicos, nosotros entonces tomamos una decisi\u00f3n sobre qu\u00e9 hacer en el lugar y eso se plasma en un r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n. Una vez se plasma en un r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n, pasamos al pr\u00f3ximo paso, que consiste en dise\u00f1ar el remedio. Ya definimos la naturaleza y la contaminaci\u00f3n, decidimos que hay que tomar una acci\u00f3n remedial o hacer una limpieza, evaluamos las alternativas, el pr\u00f3ximo paso es dise\u00f1ar c\u00f3mo se van a FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015110 implementar esas alternativas. Ya estos pasos, a partir del r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n en adelante son pasos prospectivos. O sea, son pasos futuros. Ahora mismo, nosotros estamos en el punto de tomar una decisi\u00f3n final sobre qu\u00e9 vamos a hacer. Una vez se dise\u00f1e el remedio, se construye dicho remedio. Luego que se construye el remedio, pues, este remedio se va evaluando a trav\u00e9s del tiempo )-Rub\u00e9n, si puedes darle para alante )- para asegurarnos que el remedio est\u00e1 cumpliendo su cometido, que el remedio se est\u00e1 desempe\u00f1ando como se hab\u00eda dise\u00f1ado. Y esto es lo que se conoce como el monitoreo de post construcci\u00f3n. Una vez se termina la acci\u00f3n remedial y, por lo tanto, se concluye que est\u00e1 funcionando el remedio, pues, pasamos por el proceso de \"delistar\" el lugar. Quiere decir que se acab\u00f3 el trabajo en ese lugar, el lugar ha sido devuelto a uso beneficioso y pasamos para el proceso de \"delisting\". Es importante recalcar que, en todo momento, en el proceso de superfondo, nosotros estamos trabajando con contaminaci\u00f3n y con receptores, salud p\u00fablica y medioambiente. Y \u00e9sos son los dos elementos que, en todo momento, nosotros estamos pendientes y considerando en nuestro proceso de toma de decisiones. Y el fin del proceso de superfondo es devolver el lugar a uso beneficioso. FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015211 As\u00ed que, con esto, yo culmino este proceso... bueno, esta parte del trasfondo del proceso de superfondo. Ahora, voy a dejar a Nancy, para que les hable un poco sobre la historia del lugar y los lleve sobre los trabajos que se han estado haciendo y cu\u00e1les son las conclusiones de estos trabajos y cu\u00e1l es el plan propuesto y la acci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 proponiendo llevar a cabo para atender la contaminaci\u00f3n. SA. RODRIGUEZ: Hola, bienvenido a todos. Quiero tambi\u00e9n agradecerle el tiempo en que ustedes de estar aqu\u00ed con nosotros esta noche. Ariel nos dio una buena introducci\u00f3n del proceso que estamos pasando aqu\u00ed, en el lugar del antiguo crematorio de Vega Baja ---- un poquito los... Como conocemos, aqu\u00ed se tra\u00eda, por treinta y un a\u00f1os, desde el 48 al 79, se tra\u00eda... Se escucha ahora mejor. Se tra\u00eda material, desperdicios comerciales, industriales y dom\u00e9sticos y se practicaba tambi\u00e9n la quema de desperdicios en este lugar. Se estima que uno punto uno yardas... millones de yardas fueron tra\u00eddas al lugar. En esa figura, se le est\u00e1 ense\u00f1ando... B\u00e1sicamente, \u00e9ste es el \u00e1rea residencial y \u00e9sta es el \u00e1rea que es no residencial, hacia los mogotes, para que tengan m\u00e1s o menos una idea de d\u00f3nde estamos en la figura. Y aqu\u00ed estamos mostrando c\u00f3mo se comenz\u00f3 a cubrir \u00e1rea de los FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015312 desperdicios que se estaban depositando. Con esta gr\u00e1fica, lo que le quiero ense\u00f1ar, b\u00e1sicamente, aqu\u00ed tenemos un resumen de la cantidad de muestras que se tomaron inicial. Son muestras de campo que, b\u00e1sicamente, son la base para que la EPA haya comenzado una investigaci\u00f3n, pues, m\u00e1s formal. Como muchos conocen, desde la d\u00e9cada de los 70, se comenz\u00f3 la construcci\u00f3n de residencias en el lugar. La primera inspecci\u00f3n fue en el 94 y, de ah\u00ed, dados los resultados, fue evolucionando a que hay una necesidad de m\u00e1s \"data\", de m\u00e1s recolecci\u00f3n de \"data\", de conocer mejor, porque est\u00e1bamos encontrando contaminantes en el lugar. Esto nos llev\u00f3 a que el lugar fue listado en la lista nacional de prioridades en el 99 y, luego de eso, con relaci\u00f3n a la unidad de suelos, en el 2003, las partes responsables firmaron una orden de consentimiento con la EPA, que fueron, como conocen, el municipio de Vega Baja, PREPA, Autoridad de Tierras, Departamento de Vivienda, Pfeizer, por comprar a Warner Lambert, que fue quien depositaba, BFI y Motorola. Una vez vemos toda esa \"data\" que le present\u00e9 anteriormente, nos daba una base para decir: \"Mira, entendemos que hay una contaminaci\u00f3n en el lugar y deseamos hacer una investigaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda. La EPA, entonces, divide el lugar en dos unidades operacionales. Una es el agua subterr\u00e1nea y la otra es el suelo. FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015413 En el momento, comenzamos con la unidad operacional de agua subterr\u00e1nea que, hace un tiempo atr\u00e1s, le estuvimos presentando los resultados y, b\u00e1sicamente, despu\u00e9s de la instalaci\u00f3n de los pozos, los resultados que se obtuvieron de muestras de agua, tambi\u00e9n el canal, la zanja de drenaje, R\u00edo Indio, ojos de agua tambi\u00e9n que se muestre\u00f3, encontramos que no hab\u00eda, en el agua subterr\u00e1nea, ninguna contaminante que se relacionara al lugar. Por lo tanto, se firm\u00f3 un r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n, recomendando no acci\u00f3n para el lugar en el 2004. Es entonces cuando nos movemos a la unidad operacional de suelos y comenzamos una investigaci\u00f3n ambiental. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es mi objetivo? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que yo quiero lograr? \u00bfHacia d\u00f3nde voy? Esta evaluaci\u00f3n, basado en la \"data\" que hab\u00edamos recolectado inicialmente, decidimos delinear, decidimos caracterizar cu\u00e1l es la contaminaci\u00f3n que hay en el lugar. Buscamos, con estudio tambi\u00e9n, determinar hasta d\u00f3nde llega; cu\u00e1l es la extensi\u00f3n de esta contaminaci\u00f3n y, luego, evaluar los riesgos; qu\u00e9 riesgo presenta los contaminantes presentes a la salud humana y al ambiente. La investigaci\u00f3n de suelos, b\u00e1sicamente, lo que incluy\u00f3 fueron unas muestras en la zona residencial, muestras en \u00e1reas, muestras en propiedades donde la \"data\" antigua, la \"data\" original nos mostraba que hab\u00eda una necesidad de tener FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015514 una \"data\" m\u00e1s de laboratorio, una \"data\" m\u00e1s definitiva, una investigaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s profunda. Como en estas residencias se tomaron muestras para plomo, tanto en el suelo como dentro de los hogares, en las plumas, en el agua de pluma y, tambi\u00e9n, en el polvo que hay dentro de los hogares. Tambi\u00e9n en el \u00e1rea residencial, completo, lo que es Brisas del Rosario, lo que es el lugar completo, que es lo que estoy mostrando aqu\u00ed, en la figura, se tomaron muestras alrededor de toda el \u00e1rea para otros contaminantes, para saber si estaba presente y si me presentaban alg\u00fan preocupaci\u00f3n en el lugar. Tambi\u00e9n se tomaron muestras en el \u00e1rea no residencial, que es el \u00e1rea verde, abajo, que es la \u00e1rea que est\u00e1 hacia los mogotes, que no est\u00e1 desarrollada, para delinear cu\u00e1l es la extensi\u00f3n de plomo en esta \u00e1rea y si hab\u00eda otro contaminante de preocupaci\u00f3n. Esta \u00e1rea abajo me incluye diecisiete acres de terreno, que todo ello fue muestreado. Antes de que pase, le a\u00f1ad\u00ed esta nota aqu\u00ed, abajo, porque la EPA tiene lo que se llama la gu\u00eda... \"superfund lead contaminated residential site sample\", es un \"handbook\", es una gu\u00eda que ayuda a estudiar lugares como Brisas del Rosario, que tienen contaminaci\u00f3n de plomo y es en \u00e1rea residencial. B\u00e1sicamente, la gu\u00eda te da idea o te da unas direcciones, unas recomendaciones para c\u00f3mo vas a tomar las FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015615 muestras, d\u00f3nde tomarlas, c\u00f3mo entender la \"data\", c\u00f3mo... qu\u00e9 hacer con la \"data\", te lleva todo ese proceso de identificar y de evaluar en lugares que son residenciales y contienen plomo. La usamos de gu\u00eda, que nos asisti\u00f3 en el proceso. En adici\u00f3n, durante la investigaci\u00f3n de suelos, tomamos muestras en los mont\u00edculos, en las monta\u00f1itas \u00e9sas de basura, que tenemos cuatro, que las podemos ver en color marr\u00f3n, tenemos una, dos, la de arriba, tres y una por donde est\u00e1 la otra iglesia. Esa, pues, como ustedes conocen, hubo... se comenz\u00f3 a hacer una remoci\u00f3n no autorizada y ya, pues, nos adelantamos y \u00e9sa se removi\u00f3 y se acomod\u00f3 en el \u00e1rea no desarrollada. Por eso, ahora nos quedan b\u00e1sicamente tres mont\u00edculos de basura o monta\u00f1itas de basura. En estos lugares, aqu\u00ed, en la basura, se tom\u00f3 muestras de plomo, pero tambi\u00e9n para otros an\u00e1lisis o compuestos para determinar qu\u00e9 contaminantes eran una preocupaci\u00f3n en esa \u00e1rea. Y por \u00faltimo, se tom\u00f3 muestras de trasfondo, que es lo que conocemos en ingl\u00e9s como \"background\". Son \u00e1reas que buscamos cerca del lugar, pero que no hayan sido impactadas por ninguna actividad. Lo que buscamos es ver una referencia de cu\u00e1les son las concentraciones digamos que natural de estos contaminantes o de estos metales, por ejemplo, en estas \u00e1reas que no han sido alteradas por ninguna construcci\u00f3n o por ninguna... trabajo que se haya realizado que haya impactado FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015716 estos suelos. Ahora les voy a mostrar unas figuras y, en estas figuras, b\u00e1sicamente, pueden ver d\u00f3nde fue que se tomaron las muestras. Aqu\u00ed estoy enfatizando el \u00e1rea residencial y, como podemos, ver la mayor\u00eda est\u00e1 concentrada entre la Calle Santa Mar\u00eda Alturas y Los Angeles Ortiz y esta \u00e1rea aqu\u00ed, en progreso. Una vez les recalco que estas \u00e1reas surgen de los resultados que ya previamente se hab\u00edan tomado en el \u00e1rea completa, en las doscientas trece casas, que es lo que incluye los cincuenta y cinco acres de propiedad en el \u00e1rea residencial. Lo que le hab\u00eda explica'o anteriormente, de que para otros contaminantes que no fuera plomo, se separaron toda esta parte residencial, se separaron en bloque. Y lo que busc\u00e1bamos aqu\u00ed era tener una representaci\u00f3n de las distintas \u00e1reas, pero lo que estamos buscando era recolectar muestras, basado en lo que necesitamos para hacer una evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo. Eso es lo que nos llev\u00f3 a hacer esta... digamos que estas distintas figuras aqu\u00ed, para separar los bloques y lo que busc\u00e1bamos era satisfacer la necesidad de \"data\" que nos pide la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo, para saber para otros contaminantes que no son plomo, si hay un riesgo a la salud humana o a ecol\u00f3gica. Esta es el \u00e1rea que no residencial. Son los diecisiete acres en verde, abajo, en la figura. B\u00e1sicamente, FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015817 tambi\u00e9n se mostr\u00f3 toda el \u00e1rea y, como podemos ver, fueron muestras suficientes como para saber hasta d\u00f3nde llega mi contaminaci\u00f3n. Y por ul... La pr\u00f3xima. Y por \u00faltimo, esto es lo que me refer\u00eda con las \u00e1reas de trasfondo. Si ven, se tomaron en \u00e1reas que son abiertas, que no han tenido ninguna construcci\u00f3n, ninguna edificaci\u00f3n. B\u00e1sicamente, son \u00e1reas que nos puede dar una idea de cu\u00e1les son las concentraciones naturales de estos contaminantes o de estos metales en el lugar. Le a\u00f1ad\u00ed esta figura, pero b\u00e1sicamente, esto es parte de lo que se hizo en la investigaci\u00f3n del agua subterr\u00e1nea. Cuando le coment\u00e9 que se instalaron pozos, tambi\u00e9n ese entonces, la idea era tomar muestras en la zanja de drenaje que tienen ustedes, que corre por Alturas y llega hasta R\u00edo Indio, pero como ustedes bien sabe, mayormente est\u00e1 seco. No se pudo tomar aguas... muestras de agua, pero s\u00ed se tomaron muestras de sedimento. En algunas \u00e1reas, s\u00ed nos dio unas concentraciones de plomo y es por eso que lo estamos... Dentro de la acci\u00f3n que estamos recomendando para el lugar, estamos incluyendo la zanja de drenaje para limpieza. Luego que tomo esa... toda esa \"data\", que se analiza toda esa \"data\", en esta caja, le puedo... b\u00e1sicamente, tenemos todos los documentos aqu\u00ed, disponibles, se generan unos documentos, que son revisados por distintos expertos de la FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50015918 agencia y se llega a la conclusi\u00f3n de que el plomo, definitivamente, es un problema para el lugar y, aqu\u00ed, le estoy dando un poco los valores que encontramos. El suelo residencial, en la parte superficial, le estoy dando un rango de setenta y nueve a mil ciento treinta miligramos por kilogramo. Eso fue lo que encontramos en la... en el... en la \"data\" recolectada. El suelo a profundidad, hubo un \u00e1rea que lleg\u00f3 hasta veintis\u00e9is mil miligramos por kilogramos de plomo. Como podemos ver en los mont\u00edculos de basura, tenemos unos valores un poquito m\u00e1s altos. Nos hemos dado cuenta que lo que es en los mont\u00edculos de basura y el \u00e1rea no residencial, es donde tengo unos valores m\u00e1s elevados de plomo en el lugar. En el polvo residencial... Esta \"data\", b\u00e1sicamente, yo la utilic\u00e9 para correr los modelos de an\u00e1lisis de riesgo que me ped\u00eda, b\u00e1sicamente, una informaci\u00f3n del lugar, una informaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s espec\u00edfica. B\u00e1sicamente, quer\u00edamos ver cu\u00e1l es la concentraci\u00f3n de polvo dentro de las residencias. Nos dio un m\u00e1ximo de ochocientos veinticuatro, pero el promedio fueron unos valores m\u00e1s bajos. Por eso queda un promedio de ciento veintid\u00f3s. Lo mismo con el agua de pluma. Esta \"data\" yo la utiliz\u00f3, b\u00e1sicamente, para correr el modelo de riesgo y ver, entonces, cu\u00e1l es mi situaci\u00f3n en cuanto riesgo a la salud humana en el lugar. FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016019 Durante la investigaci\u00f3n y los... \"data\" que se recolect\u00f3, encontramos tambi\u00e9n algunas excedencias espor\u00e1dicas de antimonio, cromio, cobre, talio, zinc y de hierro, tambi\u00e9n, que fueron m\u00e1s orientadas hacia las... mont\u00edculos de basura y hacia el \u00e1rea no residencial. Luego de una excelente evaluaci\u00f3n y muchos aspectos, muchas perspectivas que se toman en cuanto a la \"data\" recolectada y evaluar lo que se interpreta, se concluy\u00f3 que ya entend\u00edamos o ya ten\u00edamos definido cu\u00e1l era la naturaleza de la contaminaci\u00f3n )-que se resume a plomo )- y cu\u00e1l es la remediaci\u00f3n; d\u00f3nde est\u00e1 y hasta donde llega. En los mogotes, que se investig\u00f3 diecisiete acres, pudimos ver que solamente ocho punto cinco acres son los que est\u00e1n impactados por plomo y, por tanto, pues, necesita que se atienda ese problema. Y los valores, como ars\u00e9nico, cromio y manganeso, se encontraron... aunque fueron por encima de los valores de residencia, se compara con los an\u00e1lisis de trasfondo que hab\u00edamos hecho. Por esas muestras que le expliqu\u00e9, que estaban en lugares que no han sido impactados, cerca del \u00e1rea, al compararlos, son unos niveles que est\u00e1n en promedio bastante cercano, por lo tanto, se concluye que no es relacionado al lugar, sino que es particularidad del suelo. Una vez tenemos toda esa \"data\", \u00bfqu\u00e9 hacemos con ella? Aqu\u00ed tenemos a Chuck Nays, que es nuestro toxic\u00f3logo y \u00e9l, b\u00e1sicamente, es el l\u00edder al evaluar los documentos que se FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016120 miran con relaci\u00f3n a la salud humana, al riesgo de la salud humana, en un proceso complicado, que voy a resumir. Es b\u00e1sicamente... Lo que t\u00fa est\u00e1s buscando es ver la exposici\u00f3n a este qu\u00edmico, en el caso de nosotros, la exposici\u00f3n al qu\u00edmico, qu\u00e9 significa, qu\u00e9 representa, para los residentes, ya sean adultos o ni\u00f1os, para el visitantes intermitentes, que es la persona que viene, juega, visita, se va, por lo tanto, no est\u00e1 expuesto d\u00eda a d\u00eda, pero puede venir frecuentemente y el trabajador de construcci\u00f3n, que tiene una exposici\u00f3n menor, pero puede venir al lugar. Cu\u00e1l es la exposici\u00f3n para ese tipo de personas cuando hay qu\u00edmicos en el suelo, en polvo y en vegetales. La conclusi\u00f3n fue que no hay... El riesgo de c\u00e1ncer, presente por los contaminantes del lugar, no es elevado. Est\u00e1 dentro de los rango de la EPA. Por lo tanto, entendemos que no hay problema de riesgo de c\u00e1ncer. La peligrosidad, que son los compuestos que no son carcin\u00f3genos. Se determin\u00f3 que es principalmente asociado con los compuestos que le dije, que aunque exced\u00edan los valores de referencia de la EPA, estaban en unos valores que eran similares a las condiciones del lugar, a las muestras de \"background\", las muestras de trasfondo, a lo que vemos en esta regi\u00f3n. Y, b\u00e1sicamente, se concluy\u00f3 que plomo sabemos que es un problema y, para los niveles que puedes encontrar en la FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016221 sangre, pudiera crear un potencial de niveles elevados en la sangre. Por lo tanto, me lleva a que tenemos que hacer y tomar una acci\u00f3n en el lugar. El riesgo al ambiente; el riesgo ecol\u00f3gico. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hicimos aqu\u00ed? B\u00e1sicamente, primero hay una evaluaci\u00f3n, una inspecci\u00f3n de cu\u00e1les son las especies que podemos ver en esta \u00e1rea, en esta regi\u00f3n en Puerto Rico. Y basado a las especies que pueden estar presentes, los receptores ecol\u00f3gicos que puedan estar presentes, se escogieron aves, murci\u00e9lagos, me parece que est\u00e1 el \"Puerto Rican boa\", que son especies que pueden estar presentes en el lugar. Se eval\u00faa cu\u00e1l es el riesgo a estos receptores con respecto a plomo. Se concluy\u00f3 que el contaminante presenta un nivel no aceptable para las aves. \u00bfQu\u00e9 me quiere decir eso? Que, obviamente, plomo tambi\u00e9n para las aves es un problema que tenemos que, entonces, \"postar\" una limpieza o una remediaci\u00f3n. Para los otros contaminantes. En las otras concentraciones que se vieron en el lugar, el riesgo a los receptores ecol\u00f3gicos es m\u00ednimo. Por lo tanto, volvemos a concluir tenemos que hacer algo con plomo. Aqu\u00ed, entonces, nos movemos a un estudio diferente que es un estudio... OK., ya sabemos que tenemos una contaminaci\u00f3n de plomo. \u00bfQu\u00e9 vamos a hacer? \u00bfC\u00f3mo vamos a resolver este problema? \u00bfQu\u00e9 alternativas yo tengo? \u00bfQu\u00e9 tecnolog\u00eda existe para yo hacer una limpieza que, b\u00e1sicamente, FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016322 me resuelve el problema de plomo en el lugar? El estudio de viabilidad es un mecanismo que se utiliza para una evaluaci\u00f3n detallada de las alternativas de remediaci\u00f3n o limpieza. \u00bfQu\u00e9 me quiere decir eso? Yo busco cu\u00e1l es mi objetivo. Mi objetivo que yo quiero hacer en el lugar. Qu\u00e9 yo voy a limpiar. A cu\u00e1nto yo voy a limpiar. Y entonces, eval\u00fao qu\u00e9 hay disponible en el mercado para yo resolver este problema. Mis objetivos aqu\u00ed, b\u00e1sicamente, es prevenir o minimizar el contacto de las personas... el contacto humano, el contacto de los... de las aves, que ya vimos que era un problema con relaci\u00f3n a plomo, en \u00e1reas como el \u00e1rea residencial, en las propiedades donde se identific\u00f3 que hab\u00eda un problema, en los mont\u00edculos de basura y en el \u00e1rea no residencial. Mi objetivo aqu\u00ed es yo tengo que resolver o minimizar el contacto directo a estas \u00e1reas con concentraciones altas de plomo. Y tambi\u00e9n queremos, para resolver el problema ecol\u00f3gico, eliminar el contacto de plomo para proteger los receptores. La EPA, entonces, hace... De toda esta informaci\u00f3n que hemos recolectado, de lo que me ha dicho la evaluaci\u00f3n de riesgo, de los valores de referencia que tenemos en cuanto a plomo, buscamos un an\u00e1lisis y llegamos a la conclusi\u00f3n de que, de cuatrocientos cincuenta miligramos de kilogramos, va a ser mi valor, va a ser mi meta de limpieza en el lugar. Eso es un FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016423 valor bien conservador que atiende el problema, me... y entendemos que limpiando sobre cuatrocie... limpiando las \u00e1reas de cuatrocientos cincuenta miligramos kilogramo, todo lo que tenga un valor por encima de eso ser\u00eda nuestra alternativa de resolver el problema en el lugar. Y le recuerdo que esto incluye el \u00e1rea no residencial, el \u00e1rea residencial, la zanja de drenaje que, en la unidad operacional 1, hab\u00edamos indicado que hab\u00edan unos valores similares a lo que encontramos en el \u00e1rea residencial, en la zanja y los mont\u00edculos de basura. Ya yo s\u00e9 lo que quiero hacer. Conozco mi problema, conozco qu\u00e9 yo quiero lograr, mi objetivo, mi meta, conozco a qu\u00e9 valor yo quiero llegar, \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo voy a hacer? \u00bfQu\u00e9 tecnolog\u00edas hay para yo, entonces, poder llegar y cumplir mi meta? Tenemos estas tecnolog\u00edas, bastante simples y que son viables para el lugar de Vega Baja. La primera es excavar suelo.

O se lleva a fuera del lugar, a alg\u00fan vertedero o se puede consolidar en una \u00e1rea... En el caso de Vega Baja, ser\u00eda el \u00e1rea no residencial. Se puede consolidar all\u00ed y se pone una cubierta de suelo que, b\u00e1sicamente, me minimiza mi exposici\u00f3n al suelo contaminado. Contenci\u00f3n. Eso es poner una cubierta de suelo.

Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016524 tienes una cubierta de suelo, que te sirve de barrera con el suelo que contiene contaminaci\u00f3n de plomo. Solidificaci\u00f3n o estabilizaci\u00f3n. Ya esto envuelve tratamiento. B\u00e1sicamente, aqu\u00ed estar\u00edamos trayendo cemento o cal y se estar\u00eda mezclando con el suelo contaminado. Todo lo que tenga niveles de plomo y no aceptables se estar\u00eda mezclando para solidificarlo; para que ese plomo pierda su movilidad y evitar el contacto directo y que, en alg\u00fan futuro, pues, pudiera afectar o contaminar otro tipo de suelo o llegar al agua subterr\u00e1nea. Otra tecnolog\u00eda para el polvo en las residencias es remoci\u00f3n. Y por \u00faltimo institucio... controles institucionales. \u00bfQue son los controles institucionales? B\u00e1sicamente, son unas restricciones de uso, restricciones que, b\u00e1sicamente, limitan el uso del \u00e1rea contaminada, como tambi\u00e9n, limita excavaci\u00f3n donde hay el terreno contaminado. \u00bfQu\u00e9 podemos hacer en Brisas del Rosario con relaci\u00f3n a la alternativa de excavaci\u00f3n de suelo? Cuando yo digo de llegar, excavar, remover suelo, \u00bfa qu\u00e9 me estoy refiriendo? Me estoy refiriendo a las \"trash mounts\", a los mont\u00edculos de basura. Voy y remuevo toda la basura, toda la monta\u00f1a de basura que tenemos... en este momento, tenemos tres existentes en el \u00e1rea residencial. Una vez remuevo, traigo relleno, traigo suelo limpio, FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016625 uso una membrana, simplemente, pues, para identificar hasta d\u00f3nde lleg\u00f3 la concentraci\u00f3n y, encima, cubro con relleno para restaurar el nivel de tierra y no dejar el hueco abierto. En las \u00e1reas propie... en las propiedades residenciales o en las \u00e1reas que, pues, se entiende que tiene que haber una remoci\u00f3n, b\u00e1sicamente, lo que est\u00e9 por encima de cuatro cincuenta, entramos, excavamos y removemos, sacamos el suelo contaminado de la residencia, del \u00e1rea de la propiedad, del patio es en la mayor\u00eda de los casos. Y con el suelo que est\u00e1 contaminado o se env\u00eda a un vertedero, como les hab\u00eda mencionado anteriormente o se lleva a un \u00e1rea donde se pueda consolidar y cubrir. La alternativa de contensi\u00f3n... Aqu\u00ed le a\u00f1ad\u00ed lo que... cuando hablamos de una membrana geotextil, es lo que pueden ver en la foto abajo, es... simplemente, es una barrera f\u00edsica para, una vez se coloca, si hubiese, en el futuro, alguna excavaci\u00f3n, pueden notar: \"Mira, hasta ah\u00ed lleg\u00f3 la remoci\u00f3n anterior, de ah\u00ed en abajo, hay... puede haber suelo contaminado o basura\". Entonces, como pueden ver en esta figura, se tira primero la capa de la membrana y, luego, se pone un pies, doce pulgadas de terreno por encima y esto ser\u00eda lo que es la cobertura. Para evitar, entonces, la erosi\u00f3n del lugar, tambi\u00e9n se le a\u00f1ade una capa vegetativa, luego de terminar la capa de suelo. Esta tecnolog\u00eda requiere un mantenimiento, porque FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50016726 obviamente, una vez la instalas, necesitas asegurarte de que no haya ning\u00fan tipo de excavaci\u00f3n futura y que la capa se mantenga, para que, entonces, el remedio contin\u00fae siendo efectivo. En esta figurita, aqu\u00ed podemos ver lo que les hab\u00eda explicado de c\u00f3mo es la tecnolog\u00eda en solidificaci\u00f3n y estabilizaci\u00f3n. Extraes agua y extraes el material, ya puede ser cemento o puede ser cal y, b\u00e1sicamente, lo que est\u00e1s es mezcl\u00e1ndolo con el suelo contaminado, para que, entonces, el suelo contaminado se mezcle y cree, entonces...

CERCLA me requiere que una de mis alternativas sea no acci\u00f3n. Y es m\u00e1s bien para tener un punto de comparaci\u00f3n. En no acci\u00f3n, yo lo que estoy diciendo es: \"No voy a hacer nada. Voy a dejar las cosas como est\u00e1n\". Y \u00e9ste... y en el caso del reporte que hemos desarrollado, es nuestra alternativa n\u00famero 1. La alternativa n\u00famero 2, lo que agrupa es remover todo el suelo contaminado que est\u00e9 por encima de los cuatrocientos cincuenta miligramos por kilogramo, seg\u00fan la \"data\" que ya hemos recolectado del \u00e1rea residencial, de las propiedades, obviamente, que pues, tenemos esa informaci\u00f3n de FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Y entonces, ahora todo es verde, ahora todo es \"green\". \"So\", la regi\u00f3n, la EPA regi\u00f3n 2 ha desarrollado una pol\u00edtica de limpieza verde para los lugares de superfondo que vamos a estar tomando en consideraci\u00f3n y esto incluye, pues, reciclaje de materiales, todo lo que pueda hacer que pueda ahorrar energ\u00eda... Un sistema de tratamiento pudiera ser utilizando energ\u00eda solar... Cualquier aspecto que se pudiera implementar, eso se va a tomar en consideraci\u00f3n en el dise\u00f1o. Tenemos las alternativas. Sabemos qu\u00e9 queremos hacer en el lugar. Sabemos a cu\u00e1nto queremos limpiar. \u00bfPero c\u00f3mo yo escojo? Escojo la alternativa 1, la 2, la 3, la 4. No es as\u00ed, no es tan azar, no es tan f\u00e1cil. El programa de superfondo tiene nueve criterios que nos ayuda a evaluarlas. A evaluarlas de una manera detallada, para hacer una decisi\u00f3n correcta en cuanto a resolver el problema de contaminaci\u00f3n en el lugar. Estos criterios son c\u00f3mo la alternativa protege, obviamente, la misi\u00f3n de nosotros, la salud humana y el medioambiente. C\u00f3mo cumple con los requisitos aplicables, regulaciones relevantes y apropiados en el lugar. Cu\u00e1l es mi FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50017130 eficiencia a largo plazo. A largo plazo, qu\u00e9 significa, qu\u00e9 representa esa alternativa para m\u00ed. Lo mismo que a corto plazo; qu\u00e9 significa esa alternativa a corto plazo. Cu\u00e1l es la reducci\u00f3n de toxicidad, movilidad o volumen de contaminantes. Y eso es cuando hay tratamiento. Esto es a trav\u00e9s del tratamiento. C\u00f3mo me reduce, cu\u00e1n t\u00f3xico es el contaminante o cu\u00e1n m\u00f3vil es el contaminante. La implementabilidad. A lo mejor hay una alternativa fabulosa, pero no es algo que es viable en Puerto Rico. Y se eval\u00faa tambi\u00e9n si es una alternativa que se puede implementar. Se eval\u00faa costo, la aceptaci\u00f3n de la agencia estatal que, en este caso, es la Junta de Calidad Ambiental y la aceptaci\u00f3n de la comunidad, que por eso estamos aqu\u00ed esta noche y por eso abrimos un per\u00edodo de comentarios, porque ustedes tambi\u00e9n tienen una participaci\u00f3n dentro de la evaluaci\u00f3n de estas alternativas. Aqu\u00ed les quiero mostrar, b\u00e1sicamente, c\u00f3mo las alternativas compara una con la otra con relaci\u00f3n a mis nueve criterios. Y b\u00e1sicamente, lo que les quiero ense\u00f1ar es que la alternativa de no acci\u00f3n, si ve, no me protege la salud humana y no me protege... no me cumple con los requisitos aplicables, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9? Porque es hacer nada; es dejar la contaminaci\u00f3n tal como est\u00e1. Por lo tanto, es algo que no me cumple mi criterio. Las otras alternativas s\u00ed lo cumplen. La eficiencia a largo plazo. El removerlo todo del FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50017231 lugar, obviamente, pues, la contaminaci\u00f3n, el suelo contaminado no estar presente en Brisas del Rosario, pues, a largo plazo me crea una mayor eficiencia y permanencia del remedio. Pero b\u00e1sicamente, estamos moviendo la contaminaci\u00f3n de punto A a punto B y, en punto B, pues, s\u00ed habr\u00eda que, entonces, tomar unas medidas a largo plazo de asegurarnos que no sea una exposici\u00f3n en otro lugar. La reducci\u00f3n de toxicidad, movilidad o volumen a trav\u00e9s de tratamiento, lo que le estoy indicando aqu\u00ed es que no es que las otras alternativas... Ellas s\u00ed presentan una minimisi\u00f3n o una prevenci\u00f3n de exposici\u00f3n directa al contaminante. Pero como este criterio es solamente a trav\u00e9s de tratamiento y excavar no es un tratamiento, solamente cuando se mezcla con lo que le coment\u00e9 de cemento o cal, es lo \u00fanico que se considera tratamiento, es por eso que la alternativa 4 es la \u00fanica que s\u00ed me puede reducir la toxicidad o movilidad o volumen. En este caso, no reduce el volumen, porque el volumen se queda igual, pero s\u00ed me reduce la movilidad de plomo. Y me queda costos. Como ven, tenemos... Perd\u00f3n, implementabilidad, todas son implementables. Todas son alternativas que s\u00ed se pueden llevar a cabo aqu\u00ed. Unas m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles y una m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil. Por ejemplo, el tener que hacer una estabilizaci\u00f3n y traer cemento y cal, eso conlleva unos estudios adicionales, porque hay que hacer unos... Es una alternativa, pues, que no se ha practicado aqu\u00ed y se buscar\u00eda, FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50017332 entonces, hacer como un... a una escala menor, b\u00e1sicamente, buscar cu\u00e1l es el... si... la f\u00f3rmula m\u00e1gica, digamos. Y eso llevar\u00eda ese estudio adicional. Por lo tanto, es implementable, pero da un poquito m\u00e1s trabajo. Lo mismo, pues, con la alternativa 3; es implementable, pero entonces, ya entramos en la problem\u00e1tica de escoger el vertedero y cu\u00e1l es la capacidad del vertedero para recibir una cantidad, un volumen que es bastante grande de terreno que se estar\u00eda removiendo del lugar. Por la aceptaci\u00f3n de la agencia estatal, la Junta de Calidad Ambiental, pues, que ha estado con nosotros trabajando desde un principio, ellos han estado tambi\u00e9n siendo part\u00edcipe de la revisi\u00f3n de los documentos y presentando comentarios. Ellos ya revisaron el plan propuesto que tenemos para el lugar de superfondo aqu\u00ed, en Vega Baja. Ellos ya emitieron su carta de apoyo para la alternativa que vamos a estar presentando como la alternativa preferida, que es la alternativa 2, la alternativa de remoci\u00f3n, excavaci\u00f3n de suelo en el \u00e1rea residencial, en mont\u00edculos de basura, en la zanja de drenaje y consolidarlos en el \u00e1rea que ustedes tienen no residencial y ah\u00ed cubrirlos con suelo. Ya ellos emitieron la carta de apoyo. La aceptaci\u00f3n de la comunidad, ese criterio todav\u00eda est\u00e1 abierto, porque estamos en el proceso de comentarios p\u00fablicos y es ahora cuando estamos evaluando cu\u00e1l es la aceptaci\u00f3n de ustedes en cuanto a la alternativa 2, que es la FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50017433 alternativa que estamos presentando esta noche como la preferida. Abundando un poco m\u00e1s, como les coment\u00e9, queremos presentar esta noche la alternativa de remover todo suelo que est\u00e9 por encima de los cuatrocientos miligramos por kilogramo, que entendemos que es un valor bien conservador para niveles de plomo, removerlos del \u00e1rea residencial, de la zanja de drenaje, de los mont\u00edculos de basura, transportar todo ese material al \u00e1rea no residencial que, como les hab\u00eda explicado, ya tenemos ocho punto cinco acres de terreno que est\u00e1n ya impactados, que es por eso que los costos... No le discut\u00ed costos, pero no s\u00e9 si pudieron ver que la alternativa 2 me representa cuatro millones, cuando la alternativa 3 y 4 me representa veinticuatro millones y veinticinco millones y es porque, b\u00e1sicamente, en esas dos alternativas, estoy entrando a ya sea excavar o a dar un tratamiento a ocho punto cinco terrenos de... ocho punto cinco acres de terreno y eso es mucho volumen, a una profundidad ya sea de cuatro o seis pies. El volumen mayor de contaminaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 en el \u00e1rea no residencial y eso es lo que me impacta mucho los costos. VOZ SIN IDENTIFICAR: ---- (habla sin micr\u00f3fono). SA.

En esta \u00e1rea se estar\u00eda consolidando el material y, luego, se estar\u00eda haciendo una cubierta, primero con una membrana geotextil y, luego, con doce pulgada o un pies de una capa de suelo, que va a ser cubierta tambi\u00e9n, luego, con una capa vegetativa. Esto es similar a lo que ya se hizo en el mont\u00edculo de basura 1, que le hab\u00eda comentado al principio que se comenz\u00f3 a hacer una remoci\u00f3n ah\u00ed de la basura del mont\u00edculo, que no fue autorizada, b\u00e1sicamente, en ese entonces, eso fue lo que se hizo all\u00ed. Se removi\u00f3 el \u00e1rea donde presentaba un riesgo, se consolid\u00f3, se puso una membrana geotextil y se puso doce pulgadas de terreno. B\u00e1sicamente, estamos haciendo lo que... similar a este proceso. En las \u00e1reas que sean excavadas, en el \u00e1rea residencial, van a ser, obviamente, tra\u00eddas otra vez a nivel con suelo limpio que se traer\u00eda para restaurar la propiedad, seg\u00fan las condiciones estaban anterior a la excavaci\u00f3n. Esta alternativa ya le hab\u00eda explicado sobre la cubierta de suelo en el \u00e1rea no residencial y para todas las \u00e1reas donde haya excavaci\u00f3n, se van a tomar unas muestras de confirmaci\u00f3n que, b\u00e1sicamente, es para nosotros asegurarnos que todo suelo por encima de los cuatrocientos cincuenta fue removido. Y comenzar... entonces, entender que alcanzamos nuestra meta de limpieza. FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Ya hicimos la investigaci\u00f3n de suelo, ya hicimos el estudio de viabilidad, nos estamos moviendo aqu\u00ed, al r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n. B\u00e1sicamente, ahora tenemos un per\u00edodo de comentarios, que termina el 29 de agosto. Una vez se termina, los comentarios que se reciban escrito, se prepara un resumen y eso es parte del r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n. Una vez completa el per\u00edodo de comentarios y tenemos unas respuestas a las preocupaciones que pueda traer la comunidad, sale el r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n, donde detalla cu\u00e1l fue la alternativa seleccionada y detalles sobre la decisi\u00f3n, las bases para tomar esta decisi\u00f3n y cu\u00e1l fue la decisi\u00f3n. Y ah\u00ed, nos movemos al dise\u00f1o de remedio. Aqu\u00ed, como este lugar, ahora, b\u00e1sicamente, las partes responsables son las que estar\u00edan, pues, tambi\u00e9n trabajando en lo que es el dise\u00f1o del remedio y la acci\u00f3n, la implementaci\u00f3n de la acci\u00f3n, entre el r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n y el documento de dise\u00f1o, hay un proceso, digamos que legal, donde se firma otra vez un acuerdo de consentimiento que detalla, b\u00e1sicamente, lo que deben cubrir, cu\u00e1l va a ser el plan de trabajo y los requisitos para poder, entonces, movernos al dise\u00f1o de remedio y, obviamente, que las partes responsables, pues, est\u00e9n de acuerdo con la implementaci\u00f3n.

Viene ya entonces movernos a hacer... La construcci\u00f3n, en este caso, pues, ser\u00eda la excavaci\u00f3n y la capa de terreno en el \u00e1rea no residencial. Luego terminado, siempre hay una serie de evaluaciones, de inspecciones, para asegurarnos que todo vaya de acuerdo al dise\u00f1o, que todo sea de acuerdo como planeado. Viene una revisi\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n a los cinco a\u00f1os. B\u00e1sicamente, lo que se busca es darle un seguimiento y asegurarnos que los controles institucionales... que el remedio que se implement\u00f3 contin\u00fae siendo efectivo y protectivo a los residentes. Luego de eso, una vez se entienda que los objetivos de limpieza se han logrado y el lugar est\u00e9, entonces, listo para ser propuesto para eliminaci\u00f3n de lista nacional de propiedades... de prioridades, se hace tambi\u00e9n otra reuni\u00f3n p\u00fablica, donde se les envuelve a ustedes para dejarles saber que hay una intenci\u00f3n de remover el lugar de la lista nacional de prioridades. Y una vez completado, pues, obviamente, hay otros potenciales re\u00fasos para... en especial, pues, para el \u00e1rea...

Gracias por la informaci\u00f3n. Yo tengo una pregunta y es referente a la informaci\u00f3n que estaba dando Nancy. Usted mencion\u00f3 que se iban a estar trabajando con las \u00e1reas que tuvieran cuatrocientos cincuenta PPM o m\u00e1s de contaminaci\u00f3n. Si el nivel m\u00e1ximo de exposici\u00f3n recomendado es cuatrocientos, \u00bfqu\u00e9 va a pasar con esas unidades que tengan de cuatrocientos uno a cuatrocientos cuarenta y nueve? Esa es mi pregunta. Carlos Malav\u00e9. SA. RODRIGUEZ: Y esa pregunta es excelente. Como le hab\u00eda comentado anteriormente, que hab\u00edamos tomado unos valores FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50018342 espec\u00edficos de polvo dom\u00e9stico dentro del lugar, el agua de grifo, el agua de pluma del lugar, estos valores, b\u00e1sicamente, lo que se hace es que se entra en un modelo de riesgo, que es similar al que la EPA utiliza, para desarrollar el valor de cuatrocientos. Qu\u00e9 sucede. Cuando la EPA utiliza este modelo y llega a... te da el n\u00famero, digamos, m\u00e1gico de cuatrocientos, es usando unos valores que se le llaman \"default values\", unos valores que son general. Una vez yo reemplazo esos valores con los valores espec\u00edficos del lugar, me da que, en el caso de Brisas del Rosario, el valor de el polvo residencial, tambi\u00e9n como el valor de agua de pluma, son mucho m\u00e1s bajos que los de \"default\", que los que corre el modelo, que me resulta cuatrocientos. Qu\u00e9 sucede. Para el caso de Brisas, me dio un rango entre quinientos sesenta y seis a seiscientos cinco, que es un valor conservador. Es lo que el modelo, similar a la manera, con los valores nacionales que usa la EPA, para derivar el cuatrocientos con los valores espec\u00edficos del lugar, me indica que un valor protectivo es dejando... teniendo un valor de plomo de entre un rango de quinientos sesenta y seis a seiscientos cinco. Qu\u00e9 sucede. La EPA... Por eso es que dije anteriormente que el valor de cuatrocientos cincuenta es un valor bien conservador y es porque decidimos no irnos FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50018443 exactamente al valor que me result\u00f3 el modelo. Decidimos ir un poco por debajo, para atender algunas preocupaciones o algunas \u00e1reas que pod\u00edan traer un nivel de incertidumbre y determinamos, entonces, que cuatrocientos cincuenta es un valor bien conservador. Es un proceso un poquito complicado, un poquito largo, que est\u00e1... yo dir\u00eda que es bien explicado en los documentos, que inclusive, en el estudio de viabilidad, abre una secci\u00f3n que te habla de todos estos valores que tomamos en consideraci\u00f3n y c\u00f3mo llegamos a la conclusi\u00f3n de cuatrocientos cincuenta. Pero b\u00e1sicamente, estamos diciendo que hasta un valor un poquito mayor de cuatro cincuenta es tan protectivo a la salud humana y, en el caso de ecol\u00f3gicos aqu\u00ed, a los receptores, tanto como lo es el valor de referencia de la EPA. Quiero... \u00bfTe contest\u00e9 la pregunta? Qu\u00e9 bueno.

P\u00e9rez, acudo con varios amigos, residentes del \u00e1rea, del grupo VIDAS, Vegabaje\u00f1os Impulsando Desarrollo Ambiental Sustentable. Una de las \u00e1reas que hemos trabajado es en Villa Pinares con un proyecto. Vamos a presentar una imagen, queremos compartirla con los oficiales que nos presentan aqu\u00ed. Este es un trabajo cient\u00edfico, publicado en el 1999. No s\u00e9 si se puede poner m\u00e1s grande.

Se llama tricloroetileno, TCE. Es cancer\u00edgeno. Cuando publican este estudio, las concentraciones que calific\u00f3 pa'l superfondo, seg\u00fan Sep\u00falveda, tardar\u00eda veinte a\u00f1os )-y pone el 99 )- en seguir corriendo en direcci\u00f3n al mar, por debajo del agua. Si a eso le hubieran puesto un \"lining\", pa' que la lluvia no lo haga percolar por abajo, como quiera, el agua subterr\u00e1nea corre en direcci\u00f3n al mar, como quiera. Como un r\u00edo, que va corriendo al mar, es as\u00ed. Lo \u00fanico, que est\u00e1 subterr\u00e1neo. Eso es un... ese trabajo aparece en la p\u00e1gina 81, como escribo a mano, en un documento que resume diferentes estudios, que se llama \"Karst Region, a Vital Resource\", la zona del c\u00e1rsico... del carso, un recurso vital. Por el agua. Aqu\u00ed, en Villa Pinares, hay una toma de agua de Acueductos, pero no es la \u00fanica. Al terminar Villa Pinares, FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50018746 inmediatamente. Cien metros alrededor es la \u00e1rea de influencia, seg\u00fan los trabajos de los que trabajan con el uso del agua para Acueductos y los especialistas en este campo. Le voy a decir que yo soy especialista en recursos naturales, que trabaj\u00e9 en esa \u00e1rea de investigaciones cient\u00edficas. Eso quiere decir que el agua, alrededor de cien metros de donde succiona para uso de todos ustedes y todos nosotros, estar\u00e1 influenciado por los contaminantes que est\u00e1n ah\u00ed, tengan \"lining\" o no, porque va a estar succionando y las mol\u00e9culas del agua son como imancitos, que se atraen unos a otros, porque tienen cargas como imanes. Es una mol\u00e9cula bipolar. Me preocupa, en t\u00e9rminos de la poblaci\u00f3n, si algo tan sencillo como la pintura con plomo )-que estaba prohibida )- y a penas se va a despegar muy poquito. Ahora imag\u00ednese cuatrocientos cincuenta partes... \u00bfPor mill\u00f3n es? \u00bfO por mil? VOZ SIN IDENTIFICAR: Mill\u00f3n. SR. PEREZ: Por mill\u00f3n. Bueno.

Usted puede medir en un punto particular, pero si t\u00fa vas al pozo que chupa Acueductos, que son muchos galones al d\u00eda, se va a ir concentrando lo que ya concentr\u00f3 la tierra y \u00e9sa es una gran preocupaci\u00f3n. En t\u00e9rminos de los millones, el costo, qu\u00e9 metodolog\u00eda utilizar, yo preguntar\u00eda cu\u00e1nto cuesta m\u00e1s gente FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Y los mogotes que van a picar tambi\u00e9n, por los estudios cient\u00edficos, han habido desprendimientos del tama\u00f1o de dos carros encima del otro, cincuenta metros p'abajo, que tambi\u00e9n en Manat\u00ed y Vega Baja, hemos visto que han pasa'o por encim'e casas y las han demolido. Entonces, que sirva de lecci\u00f3n, que tomemos conciencia y que las agencias reguladoras )-\u00bfverdad? )- regulen a favor de la gente de a pie, del pueblo, de la misma manera que ahora estamos teniendo que remediar, que es m\u00e1s costoso que prevenir. Muchas gracias. SA. REYES: Gracias a usted por el comentario. (Pausa.) SR. FONT: S\u00ed, muchas gracias por el comentario bien amplio. Trataremos de manejarlo paso a paso. Si aqu\u00ed, en Puerto Rico, precisamente en el \u00e1rea norte, es zona c\u00e1rsica, mencion\u00f3, existen muchos lugares que hemos pasado por los contaminantes, compuestos org\u00e1nicos vol\u00e1tiles, carcin\u00f3genos, pero por otro lado, muchos de ellos ya se encuentran en remediaci\u00f3n. A trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os de estar trabajando en estos lugares, nos hemos dado cuenta que mientras m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido se movilice al lugar y se trabaje en la fuente de contaminaci\u00f3n, menos tiempo tardar\u00edamos en remediarlo, pero como quiera, una vez estos contaminantes llegan al agua subterr\u00e1nea, estamos hablando de treinta a\u00f1os en FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50019049 remediaci\u00f3n. Pero \u00e9se no es el caso aqu\u00ed. El caso aqu\u00ed, lo que tenemos es plomo en suelo. Y no estamos hablando de riesgos carcin\u00f3genos, sino no carcin\u00f3genos. Y debemos mantenernos enfocados en plomo en suelo y la remediaci\u00f3n que estamos discutiendo al d\u00eda de hoy. En t\u00e9rminos generales, pudiera a\u00f1adir tambi\u00e9n que esta formaci\u00f3n c\u00e1rsica del norte provee para flujo r\u00e1pido, a alta velocidad, de contaminantes en agua subterr\u00e1nea. Todos descargan al mar. Lo mejor ser\u00eda interceptarlos lo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido posible, previo a que esto llegue. La situaci\u00f3n pudiera exacerbarse con la extracci\u00f3n de agua subterr\u00e1nea excesiva en esa \u00e1rea. Han ocurrido varias cosas que han aliviado esto; limpieza, supertubo, varias cosas que han ocurrido, pero ciertamente, la inmensa mayor\u00eda de estos lugares est\u00e1n siendo atendidos. Y se han extra\u00eddo cantidades significativas a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os, a trav\u00e9s del program'e superfondo de compuestos org\u00e1nicos vol\u00e1tiles del agua subterr\u00e1nea. SR. REYES: Muy respetuosamente, el flujo del agua subterr\u00e1nea, en el caso que plantea Sep\u00falveda, sin intervenci\u00f3n por el flujo superfondo, tardar\u00eda veinte a\u00f1os en correr y salir de ah\u00ed. Veinte a\u00f1os da tiempo para uno bioconcentrar un contaminante cancer\u00edgeno. Uno. Tengo que tambi\u00e9n diferir de que el hierro en suelo no es cancer\u00edgeno. En Vieques )-que yo fui parte del grupo de FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50019150 apoyo t\u00e9cnico y profesional a Vieques, con investigaciones en agua, suelo, sedimentos, plantas y animales y personas )-, esa cadena... esa cadena alimentaria, a trav\u00e9s del alimento, del polvo fugitivo, como por el agua subterr\u00e1nea, fueron conductos a encontrar cinco metales pesados cancer\u00edgenos en el pelo, u\u00f1as y, algunos casos, sangre y orina. El \u00edndice de c\u00e1ncer en Vieques era veintisiete porciento por encima de cualquier comunidad, municipio comparable. Pero en Vieques no hab\u00eda este tipo de empresas de ning\u00fan tipo, excepto el que hab\u00eda all\u00ed, que era las bombas de la Marina. Pero poniendo ese punto aparte, la ciencia misma demostr\u00f3 que, por esas tres v\u00edas, polvo fugitivo, el agua subterr\u00e1nea del este de Vieques, que en Esperanza hay un acu\u00edfero de dos porciento a cuatro, s\u00ed se pasa, porque el hierro pasa a f\u00e9rrico, mediante cambios de ionizaci\u00f3n, p\u00e9rdida de electrones y s\u00ed se hace disponible. Y s\u00ed es cancer\u00edgeno. El plomo, igual. Me discrepa, pero esto es parte de la ciencia. SR. FONT: Pero podemos seguir discuti\u00e9ndolo y, ciertamente, hay muchos lugares con sus caracter\u00edsticas individuales y comportamiento de los contaminantes. SR. PEREZ: No, perd\u00f3neme. El hierro es un \u00e1tomo, el plomo es un \u00e1tomo y se comporta igual donde quiera. Lo que lo hace formarse en hierro f\u00e9rrico... O sea, los estados del hierro versus valencia depende de la acidez del terreno. Y en un suelo c\u00e1rsico, donde t\u00fa tienes una combinaci\u00f3n de agua y FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan, PR 00918 (787)767-5593 447-8858 50019251 materia org\u00e1nica, se forma el \u00e1cido que crea las cuevas y las cavernas. Por eso es que corre el agua por debajo, porque lo acidific\u00f3. Y ah\u00ed es que se forma y se hace disponible el hierro. Y esto es ciencia. Y no es \"case by case story\". As\u00ed es que se comporta la naturaleza. SR. FONT: Caramba, no estamos debatiendo su planteamiento ni es el inter\u00e9s nuestro eso. Solamente habl\u00e1bamos por experiencias espec\u00edficas en otros lugares, no necesariamente que sea aqu\u00ed. Pero podemos seguir dialogando. Pero volviendo al caso que tenemos aqu\u00ed, \u00bfalguna otra pregunta? SA. RODRIGUEZ: Le agradecemos su planteamiento, \u00bfverdad? Todo planteamiento tiene validez. Y entiendo su preocupaci\u00f3n. Y luego le voy a pedir que me deje su correo electr\u00f3nico para ponerlo en nuestro \"mailing list\" de la agencia, porque pues, para nosotros es muy importante mantenernos en comunicaci\u00f3n con las comunidades y, sobre todo, pues, ya, cuando hay una serie de grupos )-\u00bfverdad? )- formados.

Creo que es la n\u00famero 2, que es la que es m\u00e1s viable para todos, ya sea en cuanto a costo y la manera de c\u00f3mo manejarlo.

Una vez se publique el r\u00e9cord de decisi\u00f3n, si es correcto, nos movemos al dise\u00f1o.

Mi pregunta es para ustedes qu\u00e9 significa riesgo a largo plazo. Cuando ustedes dicen riesgo a largo plazo a las personas que viven aqu\u00ed, \u00bfcu\u00e1ntos a\u00f1os significa eso para ustedes? A largo plazo. SR. FONT: S\u00ed, veo que esto, este t\u00e9rmino siempre trae muchas dudas y \u00e9sta no es la excepci\u00f3n. Yo le mencion\u00e9, cuando hice una introducci\u00f3n breve, antes de las preguntas y respuestas, que existe riesgo inminente a la salud p\u00fablica. Esto es inmediato. Por eso fue que, en estos luga... en este vecindario, se removi\u00f3 suelo contaminado a unas concentraciones que nosotros entend\u00edamos era lo suficientemente elevadas como para representar un riesgo inmediato. Ahora, cuando nosotros miramos a largo plazo, miramos a treinta a\u00f1os. Normalmente, es cu\u00e1l es el riesgo que pudiera haber si una persona es expuesta... Perm\u00edtame, perm\u00edtame explicarle. Si una persona es expuesta, a trav\u00e9s de los a\u00f1os, a estas concentraciones. Y de ah\u00ed se saca unos valores de riesgo y se trabaja hacia atr\u00e1s para eliminarlos y llevarlos a unos niveles que son aceptables. O sea, que cuando estamos hablando a largo plazo es que si usted reside en su casa, nosotros estamos asegurando que, de aqu\u00ed en adelante y en lo sucesivo, usted no debe sufrir efectos adversos a la salud p\u00fablica, porque estamos mirando a largo plazo. A largo plazo. A corto plazo ser\u00eda si yo determino que la FASYO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Y eso es lo que estamos... eso es lo que nos referimos. Y la limpieza no es a treinta a\u00f1os, acaban de... aqu\u00ed de decir. La limpieza se lleva a cabo inmediatamente. Estos son trabajos de ingenier\u00eda, remoci\u00f3n de suelo, consolidaci\u00f3n... Esto no toma mucho tiempo. Quiz\u00e1s, una negociaci\u00f3n.

Pues mire, este asunto de los estudios de riesgo establece unos escenarios hipot\u00e9ticos. Por ejemplo, cuando se est\u00e1 evaluando el riesgo, uno va y busca la concentraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s alta que se encontr\u00f3 en todo el vecindario y uno asume que toda persona que viva all\u00ed va a estar expuesta a esto. Entonces, mira eso prospectivamente hacia el futuro. Por lo tanto, lo que le estoy diciendo es que son unos escenarios hipot\u00e9ticos conservadores. Asumen la peor de las situaciones para todos y cada uno de ustedes y, basado en eso, es que se toman decisiones. Y esas decisiones son as\u00ed para asegurarnos que se protege la salud.

(For the record.) MRS. REYES: For those who just recently arrived, my name is Brenda Reyes; I am the press officer of the Environmental Protection Agency. We are with you here this afternoon to talk to you about the plan proposed for the operational unit 2 of the superfund site of the Vega Baja Solid Waste Disposal Site, also known as Brisas. We t hank the people of the parish for having facilitated the place to hold the meeting. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 Alayon, there is Luis Santos; there is engineer Jo se Font Deputy Director of the Office; there is colleague Ch uck Nays, who is the Risk Ad visor who is going to be making a presentation; Ariel Iglesias, Director of the Emer gencies Superfund Division and Nancy Rodr iguez, Project Besides that we have Mike Valent ino, from CDM (sic), who is the contractor. And there in the back, we have Pascual from the Environmental Quality Board. So that, with that, well, we ar e going to start the presentation we have tonight. We have here recording - right? - well for the record of the meeting. Also for those that just recently got here I indicated there is going to be a questions and answers period, at the end. The Proposed Plan was distributed you have an informative sheet about the proposed plan. Also, I the second bench I left some index cards or some sheets. There are ballpoint so about the presentation here, well if anything ra ises any doubt or you have a question, well, you are welcome to take them. I forgot to mention that t here is a restroom here, in the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb.

Yes, the questions. There is going to be a microphone for the questions. But I'll be in charge of that. So that nothing, I leave you with Nancy, who is the...Ah? With Ariel? Ariel, you are going to be ma king the presentati on? Well I leave you with Ariel Iglesias and you already know, any doubt or question, well, I believe that there are m any here from EPA to answer your questions. Thanks. MR. IGLESIAS: Good evening everyone. I want to thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you for taking time to partake with us. You can't hear in the back? Better? Well, once again thank you very mu ch for taking time and partaking with us tonight. Tonight we are going to be talk ing a bit about the status of the investigation of the contam ination in the superfund site here, in the Brisas del Rosario community, giving you an update and explaining the next steps and the plan proposed to remediation. An excellent opportunity to clar ify questions. We have a lot of colleagues here tonight to hel p us understand the status we are in, what are the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 next steps and what the proposed plan consists of. If you help me around here, Ruben... Tonight's agenda, we have the welcome, well that Brenda gave us. We are gong to talk a bit about the supe rfund process. Nanc y is going to be talking to us about the history of the si te, where we presently are with regard to the remedial investigation and the risk evaluation, what are the results and the conclusions of these studies which hav e been carrying out here for quite some years, the feasibility st udy and the alternatives which have been evaluated to address the contamination f ound in the site and the next steps. In summary, she is going to be talking to us about the proposed plan as to how it is proposed to address the contamination which has been found in the area. I am going to talk to you a bit about the superfund process. As you know, this process...we have been involved in an investigation process of the situation present here, in the location of Brisas del Rosario for a few years. The superfund process of a generic location starts with the discovery of the site. The discovery of the site well normally occurs...is carried out citizen claims, because there is a referral from any state agency, because ou r personnel visited a site and found some FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500219 7 things which could be of concern as to the presence of hazar dous materials, and once one discovers the site, well, one ev aluates the information at hand to determine whether under the superfund process, the location deserves to be considered. If the information we have on hand leads us to believe that the place can present a problem, a prelim inary study is made, a preliminary evaluation and an inspection of the site and what is basically used is existing information to determine if the site must be considered to be included in what is known as the national priorities list. The national priorities list is the hit parade of contaminated locations. That is, it is a site where, well there is contamination. This is a rigorous process, once one obtains info rmation which suggests may be contaminated, under an ev aluation process and it goes to a panel which considers the information and determines whether in fact this place should be included in the nationa l priorities list. We have already taken these steps for the superfund site here in Brisas del Rosario; I am discussing it as background so that you understand what has been done through the years in this site. Once the site is included in the national list of FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 a remedial investigation and a feasibility study. These are the two steps that were comple ted in the for the Vega Baja superfund site. This study is addressed to evaluat ing the nature and the extension of the contamination: the type of contaminants present. It is where these contaminants are found. And this information is used to es tablish if there is contamination and if that contamination presents a risk to t he public health and t he environment. And we, based on the risk which it may present to the public health and the environment, decide if, in fact, there is a need to perform some type of cleaning or some remedial activity to address this contamination. If necessary, we start to develop alternatives in order to work with this contamination which is present in the site. These alternatives are evaluated, the feasibility of implementing these differe nt alternatives is evaluated, and that is what, in block, is known as the feasibility study. These two steps have just been conc luded for this site. The nature and the extension were evaluated or the nature and the extension of the contamination were defined. The risk was evaluated and the alternatives to address the contamination present were evaluated. Later, what Nancy is going to do is that she is going to go FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500221 9 over the conclusions of these studies so that you may understand the type of contamination found and t he alternatives being proposed which the agency is proposing to perform to address this contamination. Next step. The agen cy provides this information to the community and the public so that you have an opportuni ty not only to learn about it, but to express any comment you may have before a decision is made here. And that is what we are doing in this period of public comments, which ends in the month of August. And this public meeting is an op portunity we have in order to sit with you, share the information we have compil ed and that you may understand what this information is, what this information means and what are the plans that are being proposed to be carried out. Once we conclude this process of public comments, we then decide what to do in the site and this is reflected in a record of decision. Once it is reflected in a record of decision, we go on to the next step, which consists of designing the remedy. We already defined the nature and the contamination, we decided that remedial action must be taken or a cleaning, we evaluate the alternatives , the next step is to design how these FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500222 10 alternatives are going to be implemented. From the record of the de cision onward these steps are prospective. That is, they are future st eps. Right now we ar e at the point of making a final decision as to what we are going to do. Once the remedy is designed, said remedy is constructed. this remedy is evaluated through time -- Ruben if you can forward it - to make sure that the remedy is complying its objective that the remedy is being performing as designed. And this is what is known as the post construction monitoring. Once the remedial action is concluded and is concluded that the remedy is functioning, well, we go on to the process of delisting the site. This means that the wo rk in that site has been completed, the place has been returned to beneficial use and we go on to the delisting process. It is important to emphasize that at all times in the superfund process; we are working with contaminat ion and with receptors, public health and environment. And these are the two element s which we are at all times on the watch for and considering in our decisi on making process. And the purpose of the superfund is to return the site to beneficial use. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500223 -- 11 So that with this, this process has concluded...well, this part of the background of the superfund process. Now, I am going to leave Nancy, so that she talks to you a bit about the history of the site and takes you over the work being performed and what are the conclusions of that work and what is the plan proposed and the action being proposed to be carried out to address the contamination. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Hello, welcome ev eryone. I also want to thank you for your time to be here with us tonight. Ariel gave us a good introduction of the process we are going through there, in the site of the Vega Baja Solid Waste Dis posal Site --- a bit the - As we know, for thirty-one years from 48 to 79 there was brought here... You can hear better now. Material was brought, commercial, industrial and domestic waste and the burning of wa ste was also performed herein. It is considered one point one yards...millions of yards were brought to the site. In this figure, you are being shown... Basically, this is the residential area and this is the area which is not residential, towards the hummocks, so that you have more or less an idea of where we are at in the figure. And here we are showing how the area started to be covered of the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500224 12 waste being deposited. With this graphic what I wish to show basically is t hat here we have a summary of the amount of samples initia lly taken. They are field samples which basically are the basis for EPA starting a well, more formal investigation. As many known, from the decade of the 70s, the construction of houses was commenced on the site. The fi rst inspection was in 94 and from there given the results, it evolved to the ne ed for more data, of more collection of data, of better knowing, because we we re finding contaminants in the site. This took us to the site being list ed in the national priorities list in 99, and thereafter, with regard to the soils unit in 2003, the parties responsible signed an Order of Consent wit h EPA that were as you know the Municipality of Vega Baja, PREPA, the Land authority, the Housing Department, Pfizer, due to purchase from Warner Lambert, who was the one who deposited, BFI and Motorola. Once we have all that data whic h I previously presented, this gave \"Look we understand there is contami nation in the site and we wish to make a more at depth investigation. EPA then divides the place in two operational units. Once is the undergr ound water and the other is the soil. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500225 13 At the time, we started with t he underground water operational unit which some time back we were presenting the results, and basically after the installation of the wells, the results obtai ned from water samples, also the ditch, Rio Indio, waterholes were also sampled, we found that there was not contaminant related to the place in the underground waters. Therefore, a record of decision was signed, recommending no action for the site in 2004. It is then t hat we move to the soil operational unit and we started an environm ental investigation. What is my objective? What do I want to achieve? Where am I going? This evaluation, bas ed on the data we had initially collected, we decided to outline we decided to characterize w hat is the contamination in the site. We searched, also with study, to determine how far it reached; the extension of this contam ination and, later, risks; what risks are presented by the contaminants present to human health and the environment. What the soil investigation basi cally included were some samples in zone, samples in areas, sa mples in properties were the old data, the original data showed us t hat there was a need of having FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500226 14 more laboratory data, more definitive data, a more profound investigation. As in these residencies samples were taken for lead, both in the soil as well as inside the homes, in the water tap, in the tap water and also in the dust inside the homes. Also in the whole residential area, what is Br isas del Rosario, what is the complete site, which is what I am showing here, in the figure, samples were taken around the whole area for other contaminants, to learn if they were present and if they presented any concern in the site. Samples were also taken in the non-residential area, which is the landscape area below which is the area which is to wards the hummocks, which is not developed, to outline what is the extension of le ad in that area and if there was another contaminant of concern. This area below incl udes seventeen acres of land, which was all sampled. Before I go on, I added this note here, below, because EPA has what is called the superfund nated residential site sample, it is a is a guide which helps to study sites such as Brisas del Rosario, which have lead contamination and it is in a residential area. Basically the guide gives you an idea or gives you certain directions, certain recommendations as to how you are going to take the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500227 15 samples, where to take them, how to understand the data, how...what to do with the data, it takes all this proce ss of identifying and ev aluating in places which are residential and cont ain lead. We use it as a guideline, which assisted us in the the mounds, in those promontories of waste, that we have four, that we can see them in brown, we have one, two, the one above, thr ee and one around the other church. That well, as you know there was... an unauthorized removal was started and already well we advanced and that one was removed and it was accommodated in the undevelop ed area. For that reason now we are left with basically three mounds of wast e or promontories of waste. In these places here, in the waste, lead samples were taken, but also for other analysis or compounds to determine what contaminants were a concern in that area. And finally, background samples were taken, which is what we know in English as background. They are areas we seek near the site, but which has not been impacted by any activity. What we seek is to see a reference of what are the concentrations let's say that natural from these contaminants or from these metals, for ex amples, in these area which have not been altered by any construction or by any...work whic h has been performed which has impacted FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500228 16 these soils. Now I am going to show you some figures and, in these figures, basically you can see where the samples were taken. Here I am emphasizing the residential area and as we can see the ma jority is concentrated between Santa Maria Alturas Street and Los Angeles Or tiz and this area here, in progress. Once I emphasize that these area arise form the results which had previously been taken in the whole ar ea, in the two hundr ed thirteen houses, which is what includes the fifty five acres of property in the residential area. What I had previously explained, that for contaminants other than lead, all this residential part was separated, they were separat ed in blocks. And what we sought here was to have a representation of the different areas, but what we are seeking was to collect sa mples based on what we need to make a risk evaluation. That is what led us to make this...let's say these different figures here, to separate the blocks and what we sought was to satisfy the need of data which the risk evaluation requests, in order to know for other contaminants that are not lead, if there is a risk to human health or to the ecological. This is the nonresidential area. They are seventeen acres in green, below, in the figure. Basically, FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500229 17 the whole area was also shown and as we can see, they were sufficient samples to know how far my contamination reaches. And fin...the next. And finally, this is what I meant by the background areas. If you see, open areas were taken, which have had no construction, no building. Basically they are areas that can give us an idea of the natural concentration of these contaminants or of these metals at the location. I added this figure, but basically, th is is part of what was done in the investigation of the under ground water. When I mentioned that wells were installed, also at that time, the idea wa s to take samples in the drainage ditch which you have, which runs by Alturas and up to Rio Indio, bu t as you well know, it is principally dry. We were unable to take water...samples of water, but samples of sediment were taken. In some areas, it did give us concentrations of lead and that is why we are... Within the action we are recommending for the site, we are including the drainage ditch for cleaning. That taking that...all t hat data, that all that data is analyzed, in this box, well I can ... are generated, reviewed by different experts of the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500230 18 Agency and the conclusion is reached that t he lead, definitely is a problem in the site and here, I am giving a few of the values we found. The residential soil, in the surface area, I am giving a rank of seventy nine to thirteen hun dred milligrams per kilogr am. That was what we found in the... in the...in the data collected . The soil at depth, there was an area that reached up to twenty six thousand milligrams per kilogram of lead. As we can see in the trash mounds, we have some values a bit higher. We have realized that it is in the trash mounds and the non residential area, is where I have higher va lues of lead in the site. In the residential dust... I basically used this data to run the risk analysis models I was required, basically information of the site, a more specific information. Basically, we wanted to see what t he concentration of dust inside the residences. It gave us a maximum of eight hundred twenty- four, but the average was some lower values. That is why there remains an average of one hundred twenty-two. The same with the tap water. T hat data I used basically to run the risk model and see then what is my situation as to risk to the human health at the site. During the investigation and the... the data that was collected, we also found some sporadic excesses of ant imony, chrome, thallium, zinc and iron, they were more oriented toward s the towards the non residential area. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 many aspects, many perspectives that are taken as to the data collected and evaluating what is interpreted, it was concluded that we already understood or we had alr eady defined the nature of the contamination - which is resumed to lead - and what is the remediation; where it is and how far it reaches. In the hummocks, that seventeen ac res were investigated, we were able to see that only eight point five acres are impact ed by lead and therefore, well found...alt hough were above the values of residence, it is compared with the background analysis we had performed. For those samples which I explained that were in places that have not been impacted, near the area, upon co mparing them, they are cert ain levels that are in average pretty close, therefore, it is conc luded that it is not re lated to the place, rather it is the parti cularity of the soil. Once we have all that data, wh at do we do with it ? Here we have Chuck Nays, who is our toxicologist and he basically, is the leader by evaluating the documents which are FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500232 20 looked at with relation to human health, the human health risk, in a complicated process that I am going to resume. It is basically....what is sought is to see the exposure to this chemical, in our case, the exposure to the chemical, what does it mean, what does it represent, to the resi dents, be they adult or children, for the intermittent visitors, which is the perso n who comes, plays, visits, leaves, therefore, it is not exposed day to day but may come frequently and the construction worker who has a minor expo sure, but who may come to the place. What is the exposure for this type of persons when there are chemicals in the soil, in dust and in vegetables. The conclusion was that there is no...The risk of cancer, present by the cont aminants of the place, is not high. It is within EPA's ranges. Therefore, we understand there is no problem of a risk of cancer. The hazard, which are the compo unds that are not carcinogens. It was determined that it is principally a ssociated with the compounds I said, that although they exceeded EPA's reference val ues, they were at values that were similar to the conditions of the site, to the background samples, the background samples, what we see in this region. And, basically, it was concluded that lead we know is a problem, and for the levels that one may find in the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500233 blood, it could a potential of high levels in the blood. Therefore, it leads me to what we need to do and take action in the site. The risk to the environment, the ecological risk. What did we do there? Basically, first there is an evaluati on an inspection of w hat are the species that we can see in this area, in this region in Puerto Rico. And based on the species that may be present, the ecological receptors that may be present, birds, bats were selected, I believe there is the Puerto Rican boa, which are species that may be present in the site. The risk to these receptors with regard to lead are evaluated. It was concluded that the contam inant presents a level una cceptable for the birds. What does this mean? That obviously the lead for the birds is also a problem we have that then we must post a cleaning or a remediation. For the other contaminants. In the other concentrations seen in the site, the risk to the ecological receptor s is minimal. Therefore, we again conclude that we have to do something wi th the lead. What are we going to do? How are we going to resolve this problem? What alternatives do I have? What technology exists for me to clean up which basically FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 is a mechanism used for a detailed evaluation of the alternatives of remediation or clean-up. What does this mean? I seek my objective. My objective that I want to ca rry out in the site. What am I going to clean? How much am I going to clean? and then I evaluate what is available in the market for me to resolve this problem. My objectives here are basically to prevent or minimize the contact of the persons...the human cont act, the contact of the .... of the birds, which we already saw was a problem wit h regard to lead, in areas such as the residential area, in the properties w here it was identified ther e was a problem, in the mounds of waste and in the non residential area. My objective here is that I must resolve or minimize the direct contact to these areas with high lead content. And we also want, to resolve the eliminate the lead contact to protect the receptors. EPA then makes...Of all this informa tion we have collected, what the risk evaluation has told me, the refer ence values we have as to lead, we search for an analysis and we arrive at t he conclusion that of four hundred fifty milligrams of kilograms, is going to be my value, it is going to be my clean up goal in the site. That is a FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 we understand that cleaning up over four four fifty milligrams hing that has would be our alternative of resolving the problem in the site. And I remind you that this includes the non residential area, the residential area, the drainage ditch that, in operat ion unit 1, we had indicated there were certain values similar to thos e we found in the residential area, in the ditch and in the trash mounds. I already know what I want to do. I know my problem, I know what I want to achieve, my objective, my goal, I know the value I have to reach, how am I going to do it? What technologies ex ist so that I can then reach my goal? We have these technologies, pre tty simple and which are feasible for the Vega Baja site. The first is to ex cavate soil. Arrive, remove, excavate the soil remove it from site. What can we do with this excavated soil? It is either removed, to a landfill or it may be cons olidated in an area... In the case of Vega Baja, it would be to the nonresidential ar ea. It can be consolidated there and a cover of soil is placed which basic ally minimizes my exposure to the contaminated soil. Containment. That is to place a cover of soil. You can place a cover of soil and basically, you are... FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) would be bringing cement or lime and it would be mixed with the contaminated soil. Everything that has unacceptable lead leve ls would mixes to solidify it; so that the lead loses its mobility and avoid the direct contact and in the future well it could affect or cont aminate another type of soil or reach the underground water. Other technology for the dust in the residents is removal. And finally institution...institutio nal controls. What are institutional certain use restrictions, which basically limit the the contaminated area, well as limits excavation where there is contaminated soil. What can we do in Brisas del Ro sario with regard to the alternative of soil excavation? When I say, arrive, excavate, remo ve soil, what do I mean? I referring to the trash mounts, to the trash mounds. I go and remove all the waste, all the trash mounds we have...at this time, we have three existing in the residential area. Once I remove, in clean soil, FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) identif y how far the concentration reached and on top I cover with fill to restore the leve l of the soil and not leave an open hole. In the areas prope...in the resident ial properties or in the areas that, well, it is understood that there must be a removal, basically, what is over four fifty we go in, we excavate and we re move, we remove the contaminated soil form the resident, from the ar ea of the property, in the ma jority of the cases the backyard. And with the soil that is contamin ated it is either sent to a landfill, as I had previously mentioned or it is taken to an area where it may be consolidated and covered. The containment alternative... Here I added what...when we talk about the geotextile membrane, it is what you can see in the photo below, it is ... simply a physical barrier to, once it is pl aced, if there is any excavation in the future, you may note: \"Look the prior re moval reached here, from there there is....there may be c ontaminated soil or waste.\" Then as you may see in this figu re, first the membrane is laid and then a foot is placed, twelve inches of soil on top and that would be the cover. To avoid then the erosion of the site, a vegetative layer is also added, after concluding with the layer of soil. This technology requires maintenance, because FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500238 26 obviously, once you install them, you need to ensure that there is no type of future excavation and that the layer is maintained, so that then the remedy continues to be effective. In this figure, here we can see what I had explained about the technology in solidification and stabilization. You extract water and you extract the material, it may be cement or it may be lime, and basically what you are doing is mixing it with the contaminated soil, so that then the c ontaminated soil is mixed and creates, then...It is seen as weak cement, as weak cement once you have all that mixed, to solid ify it in contaminated soil. I have these technologies: I can excavate; I can put a cover of soil; I can solidify. These tec hnologies, what do I do wit h them now? Well, I group them in alternatives. CERCLA requires me that one of my alternatives be no action. And it is rather to have a point of comparison . In no action, what I am saying is: \"I am not going to do anything. I am going to leave th ings as they are.\" And this... and in the case of the report we have developed, it is our alternative number 1. Alternative number 2, what it groups is removing all the contaminated soil that is over the f our hundred fifty milligrams per kilogram, according to llected the residential area, from the properties, that well, we have that information that FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500239 27 It is over the four fifty, from the ditc h and also from the trash mounds, from the the trash mounds. I remove all the contaminated soil, I take it to the undeveloped area and I consoli dated it there. I have everything consolidated together with the eight point five ac res of land we had mentioned had an excess level and I place a soil cover. I place the membrane cover, as I showed you before and I place a cover of a foot of soil. And later a vegetative layer so that basically the vegetation covers that my laye r of soil is not alter ed, is not lost, is not minimized and provokes an exposure of waste. What I am is of...this the contaminated soil and the waste. Alternative 3 would be that fo r all the areas, the four areas - residential, ditches, waste and non residential - all the soil is excavated and it is sent to some landfill. And alternative 4 is the...basically, remove...the same as alternative 2, remove the soil from the residential area, from the ditch, from the mound, take it to my undev eloped area and it is there that I perform my treatment system, where I mix the contaminated soil be it with cement or lime, which is what I am going to be adding. Any of these alternatives is goi ng to take institu...institutional controls, because any of FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 these alternatives is going to prevent, acco rding to the alternative, the future use of the place or what areas, as for exam ple, under pavement or under structures which cannot be reached to remove the soil or remove the waste, not be altered in the future. I already have these alternatives . All these alternatives have certain common elements and t hese elements are mentioned. Obvi ously, except the alternat ive of no It calls for a pre-design investigation. In the design is where we in detail discuss all the logistics, all the ...how this alternative is to be implemented, of the design, of the remediation, of the clean up. And always, befor e the design well there are times one has to come and get some additional data in order to complete...define what the work is going to be, in a more detaile d precision. We also...the...the storm water runoff is something that is also taken into consideration. We do not want to alter or create a problem of storm water runoff. Therefore, there has to be a handling, there have to be certain controls, and in the design, it must take into consideration what is going to happen with the storm water run off. In the event... As we have the drainage ditch, it would be divided so that the rain water goes through the channel, they don't stay in residence, that way they reac h the Rio Indio. So, the two would be connected within the design. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500241 29 The agreements of access. We cannot go into your homes without your permission, authorization to enter . So, before we perform any of these alternatives, we must request the per sons where we have to enter their properties, access to the properties. A nd then, now everything is green, now everything is green. So, the region, EPA Region 2 has developed a green clean-up policy for superfund sites that we are going to be taking into consideration and this includes, well, recycling of materi als, everything that may save energy... A treatment system could be using solar energy... Any aspect that could be implemented, that is going to be tak en into consideration in the design. We have the alternatives. We know what we want to do in the site. We know how much we wish to clean up . But how do I select it? I select alternative 1, 2, 3, 4. It is not like t hat, it is not at random, it is not so easy. The superfund program has nine cr iteria which helps us to evaluate them. To evaluate them in a detailed manner, to make a correct decision as to resolving the problem of contamination in the site. These criteria are how does the alternative protect obviously our mission, the human health and the environ ment. How does it comply with the applicable requisites, applicabl e regulations and appropriate in the site. What is my FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 that alternative represent for me? The same as short-te rm. What does this alternative mean at short term? What is the reduc tion of toxicity, mobility or volume of contaminants. And that is when there is treatment. This is through the treatment. How does it reduce, how toxic is the contaminant or how mobile is the contaminant. The implementability. Perhaps ther e is a fabulous alternative, but it is not something that is feasible in Puerto Rico. And it is also evaluated to see if it is an alternative t hat may be implemented. The cost is evaluated, the acc eptance of the state agency, which in this case is the Envir onmental Quality B oard and the acceptance of the community, that is why we are here tonight and that is why we opened a period for comments, because you also have partic ipation within the evaluation of these alternatives. Here I want to show you, basically, how the alternatives compare one with the other with regard to my nine criteria. And basically, what I want to show you is that the alternative of no action, if you see, does not protect the human health and does not protect...does not comply with the applicable requisites. Why? Because it is to do nothi ng; it is to leave the contamination as is. Therefore, it is something that does not comply with my criteria. The other alternatives do comply. The long-term efficiency. Remove everything from the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 contamination, the contaminated soil not being present in Brisas del Rosario well, at long-term creates a better efficiency and permanency of the remedy. But basically, we are moving the contamination from point A to point B, and in point B we ll, one would then have to take certain measures at long-term to ensure that it is not an exposure in another location. The reduction of toxicity, mobility or volume through treatment, what I am indicating here is that it is not that the other alternatives...These do present a minimization or a prevention of direct exposure to the contaminant. But since this criteria is only through tr eatment and excavation is not a treatment, only when it is mixed with what I mentioned about the cement or lime, it is the only thing that is considered treatment, it is due to this that alternative 4 is the only one that can reduce the toxicity or mobili ty or volume. In this case, it does not reduce the volume, because the volume remains the same, but it does reduce the mobility of the lead. And then there are the costs. As you can see we have... Excuse me, implementability, they ar e all implementable. They ar e all alternatives that can be carried out here. Some easier and one more difficult. has to make some...It is an alternative, well, which has not been practiced here and one would seek FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500244 32 then, make like a...a minor scale, basica lly, seek what is the...if...the magic formula, let's say. And that would entail that additional study . Therefore, it is implementable but it takes a bit more work. The same well with alternative 3. It is implementable, but then, we already went into the problem of choos ing the landfill the capacity of the landfill to receive an amount, a volume whic h is pretty big of land that would be removed from the site. Acceptance by the state agency, the Environmental Quality Board, well, which has been working with us fr om the beginning, they have also participated in the review of the doc uments and making comments. They have already reviewed the proposed plan we have for the superfund site here in Vega Baja. They already issued their letter of support for the alternative we are going to be presenting as the preferred alter native, which is alternative 2, the alternative of removal, excavation of soil in the residential ar mounds, in the drainage ditch and consolidate them in the area that y ou have which is non residential and cover them with soil. They already issued the letter of support. The community's acceptance, this criteria is still open, because we are in the process of public comments and it is now that we are evaluating what is your acceptance as to alternative 2, which is the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500245 33 alternative we are presenting tonight as the one preferred. Going into a bit more detail, as I mentioned, tonight we want to present the alternative of removing all the soil which is on top of the four hundred milligrams per kilogram, which we underst value for lead levels, remove it from the the draina ge ditch, from the trash mounds, transport all this material to the nonresidentia l area, which as I have explained, we already have eight point five acres of land that are already impacted, which is why the costs... I did not discuss costs, but I don't know if you were able to see that alternative 2 represents f our million, when alternativ e 3 and 4 represents twenty four million and twenty five million and it is because basically in those two alternatives I am going in to either excavate or go treat eight point five land of eight point five acres of land and that a lot of volume, at a depth of either four or six feet. The greatest volume of contamination is in the non residential area and that is what impac ts the costs log. microphone). is the area this landscape area below, which is where my greatest concentration is, in terms of volume, of the lead contamination in the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500246 34 site. In this area the material woul d be consolidated, and later a cover would be made, first with a geotextile membrane and late r with twelve inches or one foot of a layer of soil wh ich is also going to be covered later with a vegetation layer. This is similar to what was al ready done in trash mound 1, that I had mentioned in the beginning that a re moval of the trash mound had been started, which was not author ized, basically, at that ti me, that was done there. The area which presented a risk was removed, consolidated, a geotextile we are doing what...similar to this process. In the areas to be excavated, in the residential area, there are going to be obviously brought again to le vel with clean brought to restore to the conditions prior to the excavation. This alternative had already been explained about th e cover of soil in the non residential area and for all the areas wher e there is excavation, some confirmation samples are going to be taken basically make that the clean up goal. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500247 35 This figure is basically the same map I have here bigger. I invite you to once we conclude the presentat ion if you have doubts you may approach and get a closer look. But here, I am sh owing it, the area of the remediation action. The areas that are blue are the areas being proposed for residential, the backyards of the residences that were ound with values over four hundred fifty, to excavation. We have the trash mounds whic h are the brown areas the non residential areas... Ah, all this soil is going to be removed, it is going to be taken to the non residential area and I am also showing the ar eas for which access is going to be requested, the residences that are going to be impacted to request access and in order to enter and do some work. This figure also shows areas li ke for example, these ... Here, previously, it could not be accesse d during the remediation. Then, we want to return to complete this part of taking samples in these residences and all this is shown in this figure, that well , I invite you to approach at the end of the present and get a closer look so that t hen you are able to see it more clearly. But also you have it in the proposed plan sheet. It is the same figure that is at the end of the handout we pass ed of the proposed plan. What then? Ariel did an excellent job FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) I wanted remind you where we are at. We already investigated the soil, we made the feasibility study, we are moving here, to the record of decis ion. Basically now we have a section for comments, which ends on August 29. Once it concludes the comments that are received in writing, a summary is prepared and that is part of the decision record. Once the comments period is concluded and we replies to the concerns of the community, the decision record is issued, which details the alternative selected and detai ls on the decision, the base s to make that decision and the decision. And there we move to the remedy design. Here, like this place, now basically the responsible parties are the ones that would be well also working in what is the design of the re medy and the action, t he implementation of the action, between the decision record and the design document there is a process, let's say legal, where a Consent Agreement is once again signed which basically details what must be covered, the work plan and the requisites to then be able to move to and the implementation. Once process is completed, we have already reviewed the design, it has gone by EPA, different experts have FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) submi tted, the comments have been incorporated, we have the final design - possibly, you will see us again, because we will then share with you ev erything that is the logisti cs, everything that is the details of how this event is going to happen --- the cons truction. Then we move towards...the construction, in this case, would be the excavation and the layer of soil in the non residential area. After concluded there are alwa ys a series of evaluations, of inspections, to ensure that everything goes according to design, that everything is as planned. There is also a 5-year re view. Basically what is sought is up and ensure institutional was implemented continues to be effective and protective to the residents. After that once it is understood that the cl ean up objectives have been achieved and the place is then ready to be proposed to be removed from the national list of properties ...of prioriti es, another public meet ing is also held, where you are involved to let you know th ere is an intention to remove the site form the national priorities list. once are reuses for the area... Obviously in residential part it is already being used as residential, the area... or there is a remedy in the area non FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500250 38 Residential, if it is a candidate for some type of reuse. And that could be at the end. Here I am giving you information about the sites of EPA on the Internet, where you can look for additiona l information, if you have doubts, with regard to the superfund program. This like I have here takes you to a page which is in Spanish and there is additional information about the superfund program, about the opportunities of community participation, that I invite you well to visit it so that you learn more. Also within EPA there is the link I have here below you can access the information as it is found and it is included in a page dedicated to the Vega Baja site. I invite you to then if you need additional information...Of course I am here at your disposal in EPA's offices in San Juan, for any questions. I am going to leave you her e at this time with Brenda. (Pause) MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Now I am going to leave you with Jose Font our Deputy Director of the Office. MR. FONT: Thanks Nancy. After Nancy's presentation, I w anted to certain points, before section of questions and answers. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500251 39 For us the process of public parti cipation is very important and that is why we are here. All the comments shal l be taken into consideration. What is being discussed here today is being recorded and each and every one of your comments shall be addressed. This is addressed in writing. Today we will be answering questions here. But to emphasize certain points. would is not selected without having heard all of you. So we are here t oday so that you let us know your concerns, you ask questions...And we can be here all the time you wish of course. In terms of the process the Environmental Quality Board actively, EPA shall try s eek the manner to have an effective communication with you. The documents are available certainly we have been working here for many years various actions have been carried out. You will recall soil was removed because there was an immediate risk to the public health. Today we are working with long-term risk. Besides the long-term risk, the underground water was studied. It has no problems. Do not worry about that. There is no FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) in excess of four hundred fifty. That is what you have to bear in mind today and I imagine that many questions will be where; where does it exceed that concentration? Well, we will and trying to clarify specific concerns of those persons who could be affected by the clean-up now proposed. And this clean up shall not evaluating each and every one of them. These they are part of an administrative chall enge that shall be attached to the final decision. With this, perhaps we can star t with the questions. Or Brenda, you... MRS. REYES: Well, you saw t he presentation and you heard some additional final points expressed by Jose Fond, Deputy Director of the Office.. In terms of questions and answers, how we are going to do this. The microphone is here. I need -it is very important - that you state your name and surname, since the youths are here reco rding the transcript of this meeting. I need you to state your name and surname. Try, please, to do so in the most organized manner possible. We like to avoid the distractions and the conversations a bit. \"John Doe asked, but Richard Roe and I are adding on the side.\" I tell you. It is a lot FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500253 41 easier. You want to get home, we want to get home. We want to answer all your questions and that you leave here tonight with all your ques tions answered and a clear idea - right?\u2014in te rms of these answers. So that I am going to ask you t hen to organize yourselves in terms of asking the questions. We have a micr ophone here and we have a microphone over here, so that the person from EPA or from t he Board who has to answer your question well, does so. May we start? Yes? Who wants to start? Remember, you have to state yo ur name and surname. If you can come here a moment as fa r as the microphone reaches. MR. MALAVE: Hello, greetings. T hanks for the information. I have a question and it regards the information gi ven by Nancy. Y ou mentioned that work was going to be carried out in the areas that have four hundred fifty ppm or more of contamination. If the maximu m level of exposure recommended is four hundred what is going to happen with thes e units that have four hundred one to four hundred forty nine? That is my question. Carlos Malave. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: And that questi on is excellent. As before, we had taken certain values FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500254 42 Specific of domestic dust within the site, the tap water, the tap water of the site, these values, basically what is done is that a risk model is entered, which is similar to the one used by EPA to dev elop the value of four hundred. What and gives the which are called \"default values,\" values which are general. Once I replace those values with the specific values of the site , it gives me in the case of Brisas del Rosario, the value of the residential dust, al so the tap water value, they are much lower than the \"default,\" run by the m odel, which results in four hundred. What happens? In the case of Brisas, it gave me a range between five hundred sixty six to six hundred five, whic h is a conservative value. It is what the model, similar to the manner, with the national values used by EPA, to derive the four hundred with the s pecific values of the place, it indicates that a protective value is leaving...having a value of between range of five hundred sixty six to six hundred five. What happens? EPA... That is wh y I previously said that the value of four hundred fifty is a very conservative value and it is bec ause we decided not to go FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 exactly resulting from the mode l. We decided to go a bit lower, to address certain concerns or some areas th at could bring a level of uncertainty and we then decided that four hundred fifty is a very conservative value. It is a process a bit complicated, a bit long, that is... I would say that it is well explained in the docum ents, which even in the feasibility study, opens a section which talks about all these values we took into consideration and how e arrived at the conclusion of four hundred fifty. But basically, we are saying that up to a value a bit higher than four fifty is so protective to human health and in the case of ecological here, to the receptors, as well as the value of reference of EPA. I want... Did I answer the question? Very good. I want to remind you that I forgot to say in the presentation that we have certain depositories of information and basically, all these documents that are in this case, go from the initial work plan up to the proposed plan we are presenting today, are available in Caribbean University , here, but unfortunately, this week they are at recess. So they would be opening...I believe it is next Monday. They are going to be there available. At present FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500256 44 they are in the Mayor's Office, on the se cond floor, in City Hall, there is a copy there also of the whole adm inistrative record, of all these documents. At the University they will be available electronica lly. In City Hall they are in had copy. But also in EPA, here in Puerto Rico we have a copy and the Environmental Quality Board well these doc uments are also available for your review, in New York. Those who wish in New York to re view these documents. We also have a copier available. These is on the info rmative sheet that I gave you, all those places are there, the schedules so that you can...those who have the time and wish to learn in more detail about the r eports they are available for review. MRS. REYES: The gentleman in the blue guayabera shirt had a question here. MR. PEREZ: Yes, good evening to this distinguished community. We have come...My name is Mario B. Perez, I am here with several friends, residents of the area, from the group VIDAS, Vegabaje\u00f1os Impulsando Desarrollo Ambiental Sustentable (\"Residents of Vega Baja Promoting Sustainable Environmental Development\"). One of the areas we have worked is in Villa Pinares with a project. We are going to present an image, we wish to share it with the officials presented to us here. This is a scientific work, published in 1999. I don't know if it can be enlarged. This image has been scanned from the publication FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500257 45 Scientific, so that the... It is handwritten, but what is here, the image per se are the plumes of a contaminant from a superfund site on Road 2, in the area... on the corner of 686 and Road 2, the industrial area, th e scientist is Sepulveda, who publishes it. That which appears... May I approach? MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Be careful, you don't fall. MR. PEREZ: This here... this here are concentrations similar to a carcinogen contaminant, which is a vo latile organic compound. by EPA. called trichlor oethylene, TCE. It is a carcinogen. When this study is published, the concentrations which qualified for the superfund, according to Sepulveda wo uld take twenty years -and sets 99 - to continue running towards the sea, under the water. If a lining had been placed here so that the rain does not percol ate underneath, whatev er, the underground water runs towards the sea, anyway. Like a river, that runs towards the sea, that's how it is. The only thing that it is underground. That is a ...that work appears on page 81, as I handwrite, in a document which resumes different studies, that is called \"Karst Region a Vital Resource,\" the Karst zone...of the karst, a vital resource. By water. Here in Villa Pinares, there is an Aqueduct water main, but it is not the only one. At the end of Villa Pinares FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 around is the influence area, according to the work of those who work with the use of water for Aqueduct and the specialists in this field. I am going to say that I am a specialist in natural resources that I worked in that scientific investigations area. That means that the water, around one hundred meters from where it suctions for use of all of you and all of us, shall be influenced by the contaminants there, whether they have a lining or not, because it is going to be suctioning and the water molecules are like magnets that attract each other, because they have loads like magnets. It is a bipolar molecule. I am concerned in terms of the population, if something as simple as lead paint -which was pr ohibited\u2014and it is bar ely going to peel very little. Now imagine four hundred fifty parts... Per million is it? Or VOICE: Million. MR. PEREZ: Per million. Well, that is going to be in an ar ea and it is going to concentrate by the suction. You can measure in a particular point, but if you go to the well which suctions Aqueducts, which are many gallons a day, it is going to concentrate what already concentrated on land and that is a great concern. In terms of the millions, the cost s, what methodolog y to use, I would ask how much more would people cost FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500259 47 with cancer - as the cause of lead - or learning problems which it causes children, between five and twenty five million, which is the difference. And I also take the opportunity to applaud the fact that even if in a remedial manner, there is taken...precau tions start to be taken to stop the damaging process from this point onward a nd that a lesson to not continue issuing permits for activities t hat are very contaminant to the human population. Right now, in Villa Pinares Su r, there has just...after having been detained by public hearings of the VIDA group, the O CUPA group, which is a part of us, a project to the south of V illa Pinares, fifteen hundred houses have been approved with... in an area of subsidence , area which is good for farming, they will plant houses, they can sink, as happened in Monte Verde, with the same geological formation, as happened...Ricardo if you remind me, I have it here printed, a house which sunk... UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: Parcelas Marquez. MR. PEREZ: Parcelas Marquez. Due to the time factor we were unable to pass it to that image you are looking a t. I also printed it. They are parcels which adjoin the land FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500260 48 of Villa Pinares, well, I'll show it to you la ter, so as to not take any more of your time. That this is the photo of a house that also sunk. And the hummocks that are going to be cut also, by the scientific studies, there have been landslides of the size of two cars one on top of the other , fifty meters down, t hat also in Manati and Vega Baja, we have seen that they have gone over houses and they have demolished them. Then, let it serve as a lesson, that we become aware and that the regulating agencies\u2014right?\u2014regulate in favo r of ordinary people, of the people, in the same manner that we are now having to remediate it, which is costlier than preventing. Thank you very much. MRS. REYES: Thank you for your comments. (Pause.) MR. FONT: Yes, thank you very much for the very broad comment. We shall try to handle it step by step. If here in Puerto Ric o, precisely in the northern area, it is a karst zone, you mentioned t here are many places we have passed by the contaminants, volatile organic compounds, carcinogens, but on the other hand, many of them are already in remediation. Through the y ears of working in those places we have rea lized that the quicker the place is mobilized and one works with the contamination source, the le ss time it would take us to remediate it, but anyway, once these contaminants reach the underground waters, we are talking about thirty years in FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500261 49 Remediation. But that is not the case here. Th e case here, what we have is lead in the soil. And we are not talking about the carcinogen risks, rather non carcinogens. And we must keep focu sed on the lead in the soil and the remediation we are discussing today. In general terms, I could also add that this karst formation of the north provides for the quick flow, at high speed of contami nants in underground waters. They all discharge into the sea. The best would be to intercept them as quickly as possible, before this happens. The situation could exacerbate with the extraction of excessive under ground water in that area. Several have occurred which have eased these significant have been extracted program of vo latile organic compounds of the underground water. MRS. REYES: Very respectfully the flow of underground water, in the case raised by Sepulveda, without interv ention by the superf und flow, would take twenty years to correct and get out of t hat. Twenty years gives time for one to bioconcentrate one carcinogenic contaminant. One. I must also differ that the iron in soil is not carcinogenic. In Vieques -that I was part of the group of FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500262 50 Technical and professional to Vieques, with investigations in water, soil, sediments, plants and an imals and persons --, that chain...that food chain, through food, of the fugitive dust, as well as through undergr ound waters, were conduits to find five heavy carcinogenic metals in the hair, nails and in some cases, blood and urine. The cancer index in Vieques was twenty seven percent over any comparable community, municipality. But this type of company did not exist in Vieques except the one ther e, which were the Navy bombs. But putting that point aside, science itself showed that by these three ways, fugitive dust, underground water of the east of Vieques, that in Esperanza there is an aquifer of two percent to four, it does go th rough because the iron becomes ferric, by changes in ionization, loss of electrons and it becomes availa ble. And it is carcinogenic. Lead is the same. I diffe r but this is part of science. MR. FONT: But we can continue di scussing it and certainly, there are many places with their individual characteristics and behavior of the contaminants. MR. PEREZ: No, excuse me. Iron is an atom lead is an atom and behaves the same everywhere. Making it into ferric iron... That is, the condition of the iron versus de valence depends on the ac idity of the soil. And in karst soil, where you have a combination of water and FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 formed which creates the caves and the caverns. That is why the water runs beneath it, bec ause it acidified it. And that is where the iron forms and becomes ava ilable. And this is sci ence, and not \"a case by case story.\" That is how nature behaves. MR. FONT: Gosh, we are not debating y our argument nor is it our interest to do so. We only talked by specific ex periences in other places, not necessary that it is here. But we can continue talking. But going back to the case we have here, is there any other question? MRS. RODRIGUEZ: We appreciate your statements your concern. A nd later I am going to ask you to give me your e-mail to put it in our mailing lis t of the agency, because well for us it is very important to keep in contact with the communities, and most of all well, when there are a series of groups -right-- formed. I am going to ask that if you have any other question... Yes, please come forward and tell us your name, and don't forget for the record. Name and well, your statement. I believe it is not on. MRS. MORALES OTERO: Ok. Excuse me. MRS. REYES: Yes, good evening. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500264 52 MRS. MORALES OTERO: Good evening. God bless you all. Really well the information that has been brought is ve ry good for everyone, but let's get to the point. MRS. REYES: Yes. MRS. MORALES OTERO: Uh... perhaps, my question is, would practically be the of talk have had. The question is...rather two. When...Because I arriv ed a bit late. When you were talking about the different alternatives available to correct the problem we, the residents of Rio Abajo have. I believe it was said...four we re mentioned and of those four, I believe there is one already wh ich practically does not count... MRS. REYES: The proposed alternative. MRS. MORALES OTERO: Amen, excuse me, yes, exactly. Alternatives, exactly. But I believe there is one...ah, no. I believe it is number 2, which is the most feasible for everyone, be it as to cost and the manner of how to handle it. The question is, pursuant to the prior experiences, how long do you think it is going to take...uh...well from t he start of the proce ss until its conclusion that you can say: \"Okay, Rio Abajo is now free of all contamination\"? I ask you because although I don't know if it is perti nent, but like many people know in this community, many ...eh...we have the problem that we don't have title to the property and then, one of the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) Obstacles put by agency specific ally are you. T hat I understand that no, because already, well, from prior expe riences, I know that EPA has nothing to do with the property titles and that they do not ...put any obs tacles, but that is the information they give us, I believe that is a way of passing the buck. MRS. REYES: That woul d be Department? MORALES OTERO: Housing Department. It hides behind EPA saying it is EPA the one ...who does not want this. And I understand that it is not... that EPA has nothing to do with that, but since that is the information they give us. The last information I had with th em, when I met with them was that until EPA -you\u2014conclude the full clean-up pr ocess, etcetera well they will not proceed. Then I ask you, more or less when do you think this would be ready? MRS. REYES: Who answers this? MORALES OTERO: Santa Morales Otero. MR. FONT: I recognize by what you say that you were not at the beginning of our talk. Only as a review, once we select the alternative finally, after going through this public comments pr ocess and the record of don't know...Can you you very much. Okay. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 Once we complete process of finally selecting the alternative, once the process of public comments conc ludes and of public participation and the record of decision is issued, we go on to a process of design of the remedy, design how that remedy is to be implemented. Pa rt of what Nancy was explaining is that during this design pr ocess additional in some areas which include properties where there was no prior access ...or access was impossible to take these samples. After the remedy is designed then we go on to the implementation of the remedy and the construction of this remedy. Right now we have no time established for...of how long this is going to take, but certainly it is a process that takes a couple of years before having t he physical construction of the remedy. Now then, with regard to the pr operty tiles I want well only to emphasize that the process of property titles is not part of the EPA's process. EPA is not involved in this property title. Those are other ----, well, that belong to the Family Department and which are exter nal to this process we are conducting right now. (Pause.) MRS. REYES: Yes, she, excu se me. Excuse me. Nancy is FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500267 55 going to say something. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: I wanted to add that... Yes, the next step is the detailed design obviously of the alternative selected, of the final alternative, which is included in the re cord of the decision. Once the record of the decision is published, if it is correct, we go on to the design. But before that happens there is a legal part which is the one, at times that brings a bit of uncertainty as to how long it takes between EPA and the parties responsible for negotiation how it is going to happen, how we are going to move the participation of t he parties responsible in the part of the design and implementation. And this could delay the process a bit, because a short negotiation could occur, and perhaps not. A nd once it is negotiated, once that legal document is signed, it is then that the responsible parties start the design. And then we shall be finalizing the details and have a ...let's say a better estimate of when, then, we would be starting the work. MRS. REYES: The gentleman has requested a turn. Remember to state your name and surname. MR. GUTIERREZ JAIME: My name is Disrael Gutierrez Jaime and I live in Villa Pinares and I regret having arrived a bit late to this presentation. I was unable to hear it all, but I read the four alternatives I have here, in... in...here present. And I have one concern. Because first I heard, in FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500268 56 part of the statement s of...about the alternatives and I know that you are gong to decide, but I am going to try to, as resident here, that the alte rnative chosen be the one that is cost benefic ial to the health. That is, the safest for the residents who are going to remain here. And I was looking like browsing and from my experience in Villa Pinares, when it rains, this subsoil...I am not...My preparation is in philosophy. But I have seen that the subsoil, the water it suctions. And was looking in some of the alternatives, that if they remove the contaminat ed area, to leave it in the same ... in situ, as they say in the same place, well, I know that... if whether...I don't know if they are going to cover that with cement or something at any time, with the water, that...that could percolate and affect the well that...mine, where I take water is in Villa Pinares, in the... in the bottom and ...and only well I wanted to state that, that the al ternative chosen be the one ...t hat will be cost beneficial to the health of the residents here. MRS. REYES: Thank you very much. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: I am going to leave it there. MRS. REYES: Nancy, you are going to answer him. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, we wanted... I wanted well to tell you that we are basically with you and we...one of the crit eria...and basically, the first criteria is that the alternative be ...complies with the protecti on of human health and the environment. We would not chose an FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500269 57 alternative only based on costs, put the health at risk. As I had mentioned, there are nine criteria. Cost is one of them. But the same as you, we would not choos e an alternative that was not protective. Also, it is a collaborative effort. EPA does not impose the alternative. Simply we state which is the one preferred and you, the community, are part of the selection process. It is due to this that it is after the comments period that the final decision is made as to the place. The same as the agency of the state which is also a part of this selection process and of the approval of the alternative. MRS. REYES: Yes? MR. PEREZ: Yes, well hello. I for got an important point. How many of you are without water with so me frequency in Vega Baja? UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: All the time. according to Moe Nimelly (phonetic) Freytes, between Rio Indio and Rio Grande of Manati, there is a greater recharge of the aquifer of the north coast. That is, you are over the water and you are left without water. That, with regard to a \"codiferendo\" which I forgot to bring up, when in... betw een 2003 and 2005, we went to some public hearings for a construction to be carried out in an area where it could not be constructed according to Natural Resources, we found in the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500270 58 Documents that... I don't remember the order, but Vega Baja and Manati, there was being extracted from this aquifer between the sixty, on one side, in a municipality and eighty percent in t he other of just this aquifer. Recently, in another place in wh ich VIDAS intervened for a project that... by... fact and law, should not have been that than what is being extracted can be taken out, in millions of gallons daily, from this...from this aquifer, over which all of you live, over wh ich all of us live he re and precisely on the land to the south of V illa Pinares, Vega Sereno, the project proposed that they have recently approved its lo despite having been detained two by our opposition ground ed scientifically, they are lands which sink, that which Disraeli point out, which is part of the group OCUPAS and VIDAS, is scientifically correct. That is, that is why the aquifer is reloaded because... and we have images here, scientific about that and observations on the land, it is because the soil are layers of sand. You know the sand when the waves come, it goes all down and part goes back. That is what we have here. They are elastic soils which expand and contract an d underneath they have layers of sand rich in silica, to the south of Villa Pinares. What happens if we seal those lands? FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500271 59 The aquifer is not reloaded that way, and t here are seven sinkholes there, next to Las Bolinas which they are going to seal. At the same time, they are fi fteen hundred houses extracting eighty gallons what Aqueduct MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Is t hat the new dev elopment? MR. PEREZ: Yes. What this means is that, if it is already saturated, no more water can be provided, one of the issues mentioned by the gentleman is complied, which would contaminate the water more. And second, we would loose the capacity of reloading the aquifer, would be less than t hat available, but with more houses. And third, do you know what happens when you...we extract more water from the aquifer than what flows? It is like a river. If we take out the water, then water form the sea comes in. And we have images here also showing the point where it meets under t he aquifer, the saline intrusion which in Barceloneta, in 84, passed to the south of Road 2 and what we extracted was saltwater. What happens if the aquifer eating cancer, would be, for more than twenty years, if ...if the aquifer is reloaded, it would take a long time to expel the saline intrusion and we would not have water. Not sometimes, but when it is drawn it was going to be sa ltwater. That is the importance of the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500272 60 the regulatory agency for the prevent ion of damages to the environment. If the resources are good and give us service, like water, well then to damage them for the ben efit of any company or any development does not benefit the common pie, as stated by the Constitution, Arti cle 6, Section 19. That in light of that constitutional mandate is that the organic laws of regulatory agencies are created in Puerto Rico. A nd that is what we are appealing to. That is, the conditions exist, yes, with the lead, to be carcinogenic and toxic. The other condition s, if projects continue to be approved in this area, so that there is a risk to public safety, that is another matter, I am not going to continue elaborating because of the time, but I also want to vote, as Disraeli Gutierrez indicates, that if the company was able to generate its private income at the cost of damaging the environment, there is a federal law RCRA, whoever soils must clean-up. And if they were good to it, its company, to generate the income, it should be good to clean up what it soiled. Thank you very much. MRS. REYES: Thank you for your statement. Precisely the superfund program is des igned so that whoev er soils cleans\u00ad up and the agency is empowered to recuper ate the costs of the clean-up up to three times, if necessary. And I appreciate well the statements. I know that some - right?\u2014are of jurisdiction of the state; the concerns jurisdiction of the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500273 61 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its regulatory agencies, but I believe that in many of its issues I believe that ...t he must be taken, perhaps, to Natural Resources. MR. PEREZ: Yes, but I also spoke to... MRS. REYES: Yes. MR. PEREZ: ...Carl Soderberg and coincidentally... MRS. MR. PEREZ: this is recorded right? Greetings to Dr. Carl Soderberg. I remember that when we went to the encounter of the federal Coral Reef Task Force, that was held now, in 2009 at the Caribe Hilton, we talked about this matter. Another person talked about this type have jurisdiction,\" with...he replie d correctly, EPA, for the use of land. But it results that for water, yes. And in the measure that an action impacts the water for human consumption, which is what we are raising here, the aquifer becomes saline, a vital resource, nothing is more important than water - forget about the light - there is no life without water. Mr. Carl Soderberg, there is material here to have jurisdiction that they do not seal the reloading zone of the aquifer and that they do not... and there the use of the land does not have to enter into jurisdicti on. Simply, all the studies indicate since the 80s. That is why the Law was created to protect the karst of 1999, Act No. 292, in 1984, 85, t he protection of the caves, caverns and sinkholes and they are FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500274 62 Planning to fill them up and it is going to impact the water. They are laws of Puerto Rico, but they are going to impact the water. Well the Environmental Quality B oard jurisdiction and EPA who could assume jurisdiction, because if they make the water saltwater there is no water available. That is the challenge. Thank you very much. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: We shall bring your issue to the attention of Mr. Soderberg. Ah and that the comment has been noted for the pr My name lder. are you going to start? UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: We can't hear. MRS. CALDER: When are you going to start? OK. When are you going to start the clean-up...eh...and how long...and what happens with t he houses that are not c ontaminated with ---- (unintelligible - speak s without a microphone). MRS. REYES: She wants to know wh at happens with the residences that do not have all the land contam inated, but there are spots that are contaminated. Nancy, you answer. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, basically well it takes us time because now well we move to the record of decision and from the negotiation with the parties responsible to the design of the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500275 63 Place, that once we have the design and we have all ...t he details of the... in the ... alternative which is selected, we w ould then be addressing you again to let you know the details of...spec ifics, both of the entry, ex ist of trucks, all those details, both of the specific areas wher e we are going to be excavating. But these areas which basically have patches within the residences, basically, are going to be excluded...it is going to be included in the part of the design. UNIDENTIFIED inform you that whenever we have a superfund site like this one - and I have worked with Nan cy in other cases also--, we inform the community when we are going to start and we visit door to door, we distribute a flyer, we always contact the community leaders and they are informed, in advance, what is the manner in which the clean-up wi ll proceed or the action being carried out in the community. But we always let them know in advance. So that you will have ...you will see a flyer or we will knock on your door. Any question? Yes? Remember to state your name. MRS. GARCIA: Yes, my name is Nydia Garcia, Mrs. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500276 64 Nydia Garcia. for you what does long-term ri sk mean. When you say long-term risk to the persons who live here, how many years does that mean to you? Long-term. MR. FONT: Yes, I see t hat this, this term always raises doubts and this is not the exception. I mentioned it, when I made a brief introduction, before the questions and answers, that there is immin ent risk to the public health. That is immediate. That is why, in these pl ac...in this neighborhood, we removed soil contaminated sufficiently high to represent an immediate risk. Now, when we look long-term, we look at thirty years. Normally, it is the risk that could exis t if the person is exposed ... Allow me, allow me to explain. If a person is exposed, throughou t the years, to these concentrations. And from there are obtained certain va lues of risks and we work back to eliminate and take them to acceptable levels. That is that when we talk long-term it is if you reside in your house, we are ensuring that, from here onwar d and hereinafter, you must not suffer adverse effects to public health, because we are looking long-term. At long-term. At short-term it would be if I determine that the FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 I have to remove it, it is already too high. Or I have to take action or re move soil. But here we are talking about prospectively making sure that should yo u reside there for a long period, make sure that you are not going to receive any adverse effect. And that is what we are...that is what we mean. And the clean-up is not at thirty years, they just...said here. The clean-up is done immediately. These are engineering works, removal of soil, consolidation....This does not take a l ong time. Perhaps, a negotiation. But these actions are carried out with...with certai n immediacy, that I don't believe it is going to take long. (Pause.) MRS. GARCIA: Those lands that you plan to clean up now... MRS. REYES: What is your name? MRS. GARCIA: Nydia Garcia. T he land you plan to clean now, because they appear on the map like they are cont aminated, there are persons who live there, for more than fifty years, more or less, about that, because there are many persons there... That is, these persons who have already been there, let's say dealing with those lands si nce then, what would happen to those persons who have been there for a long time with that contamination? Because little by little the glass fills up. FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 447-8858 500278 66 MR. FONT: Yes, she ask...the...the iss ue of the neighbor is that there are persons who have been livi ng there for a long time and she is concerned, legitimately, what could happen to them , who have been living there for a long time. Well look this matter of th e risk studies provides certain hypothetical scenarios. For example, the one goes and seeks the highest concentration f ound in the whole neighborhood and one assumes that every person w ho lives there is going to be exposed to that. Then, one looks at that prospectively towards the future. Therefore, what I am saying is are co nservative hypothetical scenarios. They worst of the alls and each one of you and based on that, decision are made. And t hose decisions are so to ensure that the health is protected. We go into this science of risk st udies, which is pretty complicated. It is not understood, but I am doing everythi ng possible here to tr y to explain this in a clear and precise manner so that we may effectively be well-grounded. Any other question? MRS. REYES: Come forward and te ll us your name and surname for the record. MRS. PEREZ: Everyone here knows me. MRS. REYES: But to record it, we need it.

I have a concern, because my lot, neighbor well a mach ine and it affected my...my lot. Then, there was the obligation to clean my...my lot, but it was not completely...completely clean. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Let me see The neighbor removed soil and deposited it on your lot. MRS. PEREZ: No, no, no, no. No, no, no. He started to clean the lot on the back. What happened? He brought a machine and then, he started to gather up the waste. It affected my lot. It wa s obligatory to clean, because there was a very high mountain. Then they cleaned part. The other, half, they did not clean it. And they continue with they will be back. MRS. REYES: Nancy or Ariel. MR. FONT: Marta, I recommend if possi ble that you stay at the end of the meeting, so that you meet with Nancy and go over the m ap, to see which is your property specifically and di scuss your particular situat ion one on one with Nancy, about the problem, okay? MRS. REYES: Thank you. Any additional question? Well then, if there is no additional question, I remember that there are certain...

I know we all have things to do and families to take ca re of. I remind y ou that the documents are in Caribbean University here in Vega Baja, on Road 661 and intersection with Road Number 2, in City Hall, on the second floor, in our EPA offices in San Juan, in Santurce, on Ponce de Leon Avenue, where we will very gladly assist you. They are also at the Environmental Q uality Board and in EPA's office in New York. We greatly appreciate all your You have...? gible, Internet, whether the documents may be accessed on the Internet. MRS. RODRIGUEZ: The documents ar e...eh...electronic they are going to be available, but not...right now, they are not in...so that...I imagine that from your home you may access them. We woul d have to work on that. They are in Caribbean University, electronically, the same as in EPA, the Environmental Quality Board, they are going to be electronically.

MRS. RODRIGUEZ: Yes, we have... we distributed here an informative flyer. It is a more resumed flyer as to the information of the proposed plan, but the proposed plan in Spanish is going to be available in the repositories. MRS. REYES: I remind you to sign the attendance sheet and well, if you want to leave your e-mail and remember y ou have until August 29 to submit your comments with regard to the proposed plan, of this superfund site. Thank you very much. We appreciate the... Yes? Yes? Tell me. UNIDENTIFIED VOICE: Some years back, they tested the children, but those children are no longer ch ildren. Those children have children. And fat ones. And they are growing in the same plac e they grew up. And many of them...you know, were not tested because they are outside of the age. But they are raising their children here. So, what is going to be done with them, the new ones here? (Pause.) MR. FONT: Yes, the study to establish the risk for the concentrations of lead in soil, the study which was FAYSO REPORTERS - English and Spanish 510 Octavio Marcano Street Urb. Roosevelt San Juan PR 00918 (787) 767-593 by the lead concentrations as was explained by Nancy was a specific study in this place. And this study is a mathematical equation that to put it simply , what it does is establish... it uses the concentrations of lead in dust, the concentrations of lead in drinking water the the acceptable levels of lead in the blood. That is that the data for us to ma ke the decision of the level of lead which we are going to clean was based on the data of the dust in the residences and the drinking water. From there, we extrapolate to see how much can be accepted of the lead level in so il without it presenting a risk. That is that indirectly the...the....the mathematical formula provides as a constant a number alr eady given, which is the ma ximum lead which should be allowed to a population to be ac ceptable and that does not present a risk.
