The taste was refreshing with a mild herbal note. Oh well, it was interesting to try a beer from Peru. B- overall: 1.25 Seems to be a cheap knockoff Labatt, or it seems to be. Nothing special or worth noting. Very bland overall: 2.25 You can say what you want about this beer, it is not the greatest of beers by a long shot. However, it is certainly a great beach beer, and I am drinking the hell out of it while I sit on a Cuban beach. [Feb 27, 2018](/beer/profile/1685/8628/?ba=polloenfuego#lists) Rated: Drank my moneys worth of this stuff while in Cuba for 8 days... Serving Type: Can, Bottle, and Draught L- Pours a bright hay yellow topped by a 1/2 finger fluffy white head. Half decent retention (great for an AAL). S- Faint aroma grain, corny sweetness, and a hopiness. Nothing bad Same as the smell. and a and fairly solid this brew is fantastic. It doesn't have anything offputting and doesn't really have much to offer. Refreshing and cheap. If I make it to Cuba again, you can bet I'll be putting back some Cristal on the beach.

If I make it to Cuba again, you can bet I'll be putting back some Cristal on the of this as well as on tap samples while away in Cuba for a week. Served cold into a pilsner glass. Appearance -Pale golden color, clear with plenty of carbonation. A small cap of white head is poured and sometimes lingers. Smell - Not a lot here, some faint graininess in general and no off aromas, so that's a plus. Taste - Again not a lot of flavor, light grassy flavors and a hint of grain with nothing off-putting. Mouthfeel - Smooth and watery, light bodied with just enough crisp carbonation to make things interesting. Overall - While not a great beer, it really does hit the spot and when laying on a beach or poolside for hours under the hot Cuban sun. A beer that very much can get some positive ratings due to the memories it invokes. For what it is, it is quite good. Dos cervezas por favor!

Dos cervezas por Clara, (30 pesos): Quite a basic & fairly poor lager but not unlike what I was expecting going in really & at least it wasn't offensive or off-putting. There was a few skunky touches early on but for the most part the beer featured the usual corn, hay & basic adjunct flavours but not much else. It was easy to drink throughout though, probably due to the heat in Cuba & as such I can't imagine it's one I'd have again if I were in the UK & it was more readily available here.
