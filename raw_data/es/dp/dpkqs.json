The aim of this study was to evaluate HRQOL in children whit a history of severe malnutrition before 2 years of life, expecting to find lower scores in these patients.Materials and methods A comparative study was performed on schoolchildren between 5 and 12 years with a history of early severe malnutrition, excluding those with chronic were recorded and the HRQOL was assessed with PedsQL4.0. Chi square and Student t test were applied. Significance level: P<.05.Results A total of 25 were studied. The HRQOL scores obtained from PedsQL for lower HRQOL scores compared with controls. La desnutrici\u00f3n severa en ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os produce secuelas a largo plazo, especialmente trastornos del aprendizaje y de adaptaci\u00f3n psicosocial. Dichos aspectos est\u00e1n vinculados con la calidad de vida relacionada a la salud (CVRS). La calidad de vida en ni\u00f1os desnutridos no ha sido suficientemente estudiada. El objetivo fue evaluar CVRS en escolares con antecedentes de desnutrici\u00f3n severa antes de los 2 a\u00f1os de vida, estimando encontrar puntuaciones m\u00e1s bajas en estos pacientes.Material y m\u00e9todo En un estudio comparativo se incluyeron escolares de 5 a 12 a\u00f1os con antecedentes de desnutrici\u00f3n severa y se excluyeron aquellos con enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas. Los controles fueron los hermanos sanos de los pacientes. Muestreo por conveniencia; tama\u00f1o muestral estimado en 26 sujetos por grupo (52 en total). Se midieron CVRS con formulario PedsQL4.0 y variables sociodemogr\u00e1ficas. Las diferencias se analizaron con la prueba de la Chi cuadrado y el test de la \u00abt\u00bb de Student. El nivel de significaci\u00f3n fue: p<0,05.Resultados Se estudiaron 25 pacientes y 28 controles. Las puntuaciones de CVRS obtenidas por los ni\u00f1os con antecedentes de desnutrici\u00f3n, en comparaci\u00f3n con sus hermanos sanos, fueron: total 85,00\u00b13,51 (p=<0,0001).Conclusiones Los pacientes con antecedentes de desnutrici\u00f3n severa temprana presentaron puntuaciones significativamente menores de CVRS comparados con los controles. The risk of mortality in severe malnutrition is 5%, [1](#bib0005) and it is estimated that over one third of deaths in children younger than 5 years can be attributed to malnutrition. [2](#bib0010) Cognitive development and learning may beyond the period of acute complications. Severe malnutrition before age 3 years (a critical period in brain development) may have sequelae such as delays in cognitive development of education may have a negative influence on cognitive development and academic performance. [7,8](#bib0035) Early has consequences on the development, learning, and interpersonal relationships of over half of the surviving children. [1-8](#bib0005) The reduced ability of the individual to interact with the environment and with other individuals may limit his or her potential to have a healthy, happy, and productive life. [9,10](#bib0045) Our working hypothesis was that schoolchildren with a history of early malnutrition have biological, psychological, and psychosocial sequelae, and intimately related these developments, the of the patients. It is now recognised that individuals with the same objective health status can report very different subjective quality of life due to [10,11](#bib0050) health in other dimensions of human experience, such as personal achievement, satisfaction, wellbeing, happiness, and self-esteem. [11,12](#bib0055) latter. [10-13](#bib0050) The World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged the critical link between physical and psychosocial health. In recent decades, the assessment of HRQoL has to from an integral perspective, measuring the impact of disease from the perspective of the patient or his or her family. [13,14](#bib0065) For the above reasons, the aim of this study was to assess the impact on HRQoL in its physical, emotional, social, and school dimensions from the perspective of the parents of children with a history of early severe malnutrition, measured using the Spanish version of the Version 4.0 validated We designed a comparative of a population of children of both sexes aged 5 to 12 years that included 29 patients with a history of severe malnutrition before age 2 years, and excluded 19 patients <3 SD (or <85% of or with oedema. We collected the socioeconomic and anthropometric retrospectively the medical records of patients. The sample was obtained by successive sampling based on hospital records from between January 1997 and June 2005, and then we visited the respective families at their homes or contacted them by phone when a visit was not possible. In administering the quality of life questionnaires to the parents, children with a history of early severe malnutrition were considered the study group, and their healthy school-aged siblings the control group. The interviews took place between March 2009 and May 2010. We calculated the minimum sample size for a power of 95%, a 95% confidence interval, and an accuracy of 1% in estimating a difference in the total PedsQL score of at least 2 points (out of a total of 52). There is evidence that the survey can be administered to low-income populations and can adequately telephone, whichever the medical history, informed consent, and giving the survey to the respondent (father, mother, or caregiver) for its completion. We on age; sex; socioeconomic status (SES) described according to the index defined by the Centro de Estudios sobre Nutrici\u00f3n Infantil (Centre for the Study of Child Nutrition [CESNI]), [18](#bib0090) modified in the C\u00f3rdoba, lactancia, crecimiento y desarrollo (CLACyD) study and summarised into 3 strata: (1) High and middle, (2) low and (3) Very low [19](#bib0095); maternal level of education, single- or and height recorded in the charts of the health care centre that provided care for the child). We assessed the HRQoL using the PedsQL, considering all 23 the score, arranged in four multidimensional scales - physical, emotional, social, and school - and two summary scores - for psychosocial health (the average of the last three dimensions) and for physical health (which corresponded to the physical dimension). Due to the poor cognition characteristics expected in our patients and to the difficulties that children aged 5-7 years have in understanding and completing the questionnaire, by Roizen we used the parent-proxy version for parents of children 5-7 years and children 8-12 a\u00f1os, [15,16,20](#bib0075) with 5-point Likert scales a problem). The parent responses had to refer to the month preceding the administration of the survey (one month recall period). Subsequently, the items were reverse-scored (lower with non-normal distributions and ranges. Discrete variables were expressed percentages for a 95% CI. We used Student's or the Kruskall-Wallis test, when applicable, to continuous variables, and the chi squared test to compare discrete variables. The level of statistical significance was set at P<.05. The study was assessed and approved by the Comit\u00e9 Institucional de \u00c9tica de Investigaci\u00f3n en Salud (Institutional Ethics Committee for Health Research [CIEIS]) of the Polo Sanitario area and the Consejo de Evaluaci\u00f3n \u00c9tica de Investigaci\u00f3n en Salud (Ethical Evaluation Board for Health Research [CoEIS]), of the Ministerio de Salud (Health Ministry) of the government of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina). It has been entered in the Registro Provincial de Investigaciones en Salud (Provincial Registry of Health Studies [REPIS]), of the Ministerio de Salud of the government of the province of Cordoba (Argentina). We obtained the informed consent of the parents who responded to the survey, explaining the objective of the study, the possible link between malnutrition and quality of life, and underscoring the confidentiality of the data.Results We reviewed 357 medical histories with a diagnostic code of malnutrition or severe malnutrition, a of 29 patients. Two of the home addresses were not correct, and two families refused to participate: four families out of 29 (13/8%; 95% CI, 3.8-31.6). We included 25 patients in the study group and 28 healthy school-aged siblings. The HRQoL assessment was performed in 53 school-aged children from 25 families (25 children in the study group [47.2%; 95% CI, 33.5-62.6] and 28 children in the control group [52.8; 95% CI, 52.8-67.2]). The time that had elapsed since the diagnosis of malnutrition ranged from 3.5 to 9.9 years. The data of the sociodemographic and baseline characteristics of the Baseline sociodemographic characteristics of sample the study group and 0.49 (\u00b10.20) in the control group (P<.0500). In the study group, the mean height z score was 1.44 (\u00b11.50) scores obtained with the PedsQL scale in was that early severe malnutrition was significantly associated with a considerable reduction in quality of life during school-age years in all studied (physical dimension/health and psychosocial health scores, and emotional, social, and school dimensions). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this kind. Malnutrition in young children continues to be a serious public health problem in our country and across the world. Globally, there are 165 million children stunted by malnutrition, and the prevalence of wasting is 8%, according to a report published by the WHO in 2012. [2](#bib0010) In Argentina, the prevalence the long term, malnourished children will not have the same professional opportunities; human capital and productivity are affected will give rise, inevitably, a new generation of malnourished individuals. demographic data of the families revealed that households typically sustained informal had These sociodemographic circumstances in our patients, which carry a risk of non-organic malnutrition. [25,26](#bib0125) Other family and social factors present among the respondents and associated with those of same that did not report similar experiences. [30](#bib0150) Our patients were severely malnourished at an early age, with risk of serious sequelae in the mid- and long-term. In current mean z score for weight and height in cases and controls shows deviations lower than 2, and while height is multifactorial, the finding of a lower height z score in cases compared to their control siblings seemed to suggest a chronic evolution. Falling behind in school occurred in one fifth of participants, including cases and controls. The regression analysis performed that they had lower arithmetic scores and were more likely to have repeated a grade, have seen a psychologist, and have getting with their peers. [31](#bib0155) Sameroff studied the intelligence scores of a group of children aged 4 to 13 years in relation to family and social risk factors, and found that the lowest intelligence coefficients were associated with a collection of factors rather than to isolated ones. [32](#bib0160) The low level of maternal educational attainment and unskilled labour as the source of income may have contributed to malnutrition in our sample, and therefore to poor academic achievement in study participants. Cases and controls in our study share the same risk factors for falling behind in school, yet children with a history of malnutrition scored lower on the school dimension. From the perspective parents, this finding that results by applying the PedsQL 4.0 to 25 patients with a history of severe malnutrition and 28 controls showed differences between the groups that may be related to the effect of early malnutrition on HRQoL in patients that had been affected by the condition. The work of Roizen, carried out in Argentina with patients of sociodemographic characteristics to those of our patients, for comparisons based on belonging to a low stratum of SES and maternal educational level. [16](#bib0080) The study analysed 287 families with children adolescents had chronic diseases, was agreement between HRQoL reports of parents and children, and lower scores in the reports by physicians. [16](#bib0080) When we analysed the four dimensions and the physical and psychosocial health scores for the HRQoL reports by the parents, we found differences between malnourished and healthy children. This was the main finding of our study. Since there are no previous studies on HRQoL in malnourished children, comparisons may be made with other research on chronic conditions associated with physical and psychosocial health scores in healthy children were similar to those reported by for in [16](#bib0080). In all our comparisons with other studies, the physical health score in the malnourished children was higher, an skills, [1-3](#bib0005) they are compared to, in the context of our study were the emotional, social and school dimensions, which may be affected in malnourished children. The psychosocial health scores in healthy children were similar to those reported in by [15-33](#bib0075) for The scores of malnourished children in our sample were similar to those reported for children with chronic conditions. [15,16](#bib0075) confirmed: early in a lasting impact on survivors, and increase the cost to society. [23](#bib0115) The comparison of HRQoL in children with a history of severe malnutrition and their healthy critical periods of extreme there can be protective factors such as a mother's care, social skill to adapt to unfavourable environments. [26](#bib0130) the healthy siblings of those patients that filled out the questionnaires, so the social, economic, and cultural conditions are the same, and intrafamilial differences in HRQoL cannot be accounted for. Were there early problems in attachment in malnourished children that influenced the care that they received? Did malnourished children have physiological or psychological characteristics that their If so, could this fact have affected their HRQoL? Research on the could provide patients have their developmental potential due to malnutrition. The care received by children with a history of malnutrition has an impact on their personal futures and also on society, where the spiral effect will propagate the consequences of the for generations. The assessment of HRQoL should be part of the holistic care of these patients, in order to adjust treatment as needed and promote parent involvement children with severe malnutrition, this study suggests a way to make a more thorough follow up of the evolution of sequelae. It would also be possible to conditions can contribute to a reduction in the quality of life in the children who suffer them. Some strengths of this study are that it is the first study that describes the association between malnutrition and a reduction in quality of life, with few losses to follow-up and recovery, resulting in a strong statistical significance. There are limitations to this study, as the initial data were collected retrospectively, which could lead to bias, recall bias, and selection bias. The results of this study show that patients with a history of early severe malnutrition had reduction in HRQoL compared siblings in areas of physical, psychosocial, emotional, social, and school functioning.Funding This study is part of the Programa de Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Calidad de Vida en los Ni\u00f1os (Programme for the Evaluation of Quality of Life in Children) of the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina).Conflicts of interest The authors have De Grandis ES, Armelini PA, Cuestas E.
