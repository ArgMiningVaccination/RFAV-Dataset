They can leave behind saliva when they chew or defecate. Either material contains developed over the approaches start by identifying parts of DNA strands that are common to a certain group of organisms, such as arthropods. In this new work, the researchers used such an approach to separate bug eDNA from plant DNA. They then boiled the samples in water, from which they obtained the eDNA. Next, they studied the eDNA to source. Prior work studying eDNA has typically involved study of material sampled from both wet and dry locations. The researchers note that they get their best results when they find samples that have been well-preserved in some manner, which got them to thinking about teas and herbs. In their work, the team studied 40 tea and herb samples and found eDNA for over 1,200 unique species of More predators, contained eDNA from at least 200 creatures in it and that green tea had the most. The researchers suggest their work expands the range of eDNA study and opens the door to the possibility of using their technique as a way a variable impacts across the planet.
