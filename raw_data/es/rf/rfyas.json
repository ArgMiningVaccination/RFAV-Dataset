Las colonist turned Dominican friar, became sixteenth the most outspoken critics of Spanish colonisation, against which he waged campaign conducted both person of of closely argued text. Lauded in his own lifetime as the defender of the Indians, he praised their virtue and excoriated their treatment at the hands of Spanish colonists. Las Casas played a central role in convincing the Spanish crown to restrict the authority settlers doubted that differed Spaniards not only in their behaviour (Amerindians were docile sheep, while Spaniards were ravening wolves) but also in their bodies. Las Casas framed these differences in the humoral and Indians were brothers, having descended, as had all people, from Adam and Eve. Las Casas, however, offered a simple explanation: they on different foods. While Europeans ate the wheat bread and wine that Columbus had would herbs and things from the earth and fish'. [1](#c00342-1-14) This cold food generated the abundance of cold humours that characterised the indigenous body, and which consequently shaped their character. Diet, in other words, was behind the distinctive indigenous new subjects, for Spaniards were fascinated by differences (and similarities) that they detected between their bodies and those of Amerindians. This concern far more idle curiosity, environment. from Amerindians, by unravelling the complex web of associations that linked the fate of settlers to the bodies of Indians. As we shall see, Spanish ideas about health, bodily integrity and character, which were based fundamentally on the of humoral theory, accorded importance to diet as a means of regulating the body. Food, more than any other factor, was what separated Amerindian bodies from Spanish bodies, but it was a bulwark. This chapter outlines colonial debates about the differences - which were by no means permanent - its and foods.] Spanish bodies, Indian bodies The Spaniards who travelled in the Indies in the early modern era quickly determined that Amerindian bodies differed from their own in all sorts of ways. Indians were usually said colour virtually indistinguishable from Spaniards. They had distinctively straight hair, contrast were a proud nature, possessed light skin and of the reasons that Indians and Spaniards were so different was that they lived in very different environments. Since the time of Hippocrates European writers had drawn connections between the and during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the influence of climate on the human constitution was universally acknowledged. As one Spanish scholar put it in 1608, 'people to a certain extent resemble the place where they are born'.] [3](#c00342-1-16) To begin with, climate was believed to shape character. Individuals living in very cold environments, for example, were likely to be hardy, fierce and stupid. Climate further played a key part in determining appearance. Writing in the early seventeenth century, the Dominican priest Gregorio Garc\u00eda explained that Ethiopians had a dark skin because they lived in the heat of the torrid zone, although they were, like all men, the sons of Noah (who had undoubtedly been white). Prolonged residence in a hot climate had permanently altered their appearance. [4](#c00342-1-17) (Garc\u00eda, in common with most of his contemporaries, saw nothing surprising in this sort of transformation.) In addition to causing changes in skin and hair colour, climate was also believed to affect individual health, and the wrong air or temperature could provoke serious illness. Columbus, as we saw, had ascribed the sickness afflicting his settlement on Hispaniola in part to the region's unfamiliar air. Some climates damp, swampy places were viewed was considered unwise to undergo sudden alterations of environment, even from an unhealthy to a more salubrious climate. As the fifteenth-century Spanish historian Diego Rodr\u00edguez de Almela explained, 'the complexion is shaped by the air of the place where one was raised and unfamiliar air can and does make men ill'. [5](#c00342-1-18) Overall, in the words of the cosmographer Henrico Mart\u00ednez, a change in climate could result in a change in attuned to the potential impact of the stars and temperature. They paid careful attention to the climate, and advised other settlers to do the same. The Spanish captain Bernardo de Vargas Machuca, for example, stipulated that 'in the Indies, people who want to stay healthy will live in the climate that their complexion demands'. Subjecting one's body to changes in illness', he warned.] [7](#c00342-1-20) Beyond a new provoke all sorts of other undesirable transformations as This fear was well expressed by the royal cosmographer Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco, who noted in a report from the 1570s that 'what with living under different stars and in a different climate', Spaniards who resided for a long time in the Indies 'inevitably undergo some change in the colour and quality of persons'. He explained that: It is moreover well known that those who are born here, and are called creoles, and whom everyone considers to be Spanish, in fact Spaniards in their colour and size, because they are bigger and their colour is somewhat darker as a result of the nature of the land. From this one can conclude that after many years even Spaniards who have not mixed with the natives will become like them, not simply in their bodies, but also in their spirit, for the spirit is shaped by the temperament of the body. [8](#c00342-1-21) L\u00f3pez de Velasco's observations encapsulated of the overseas colonisation provoked in Europeans. As he stated, mere residence in the unfamiliar climate of the new world might transform Spaniards, body and soul, into some other sort of being. They risked becoming not only taller and darker, but also different in character. As he made clear, this transformation would be caused by the environment, not 'mixing' with indigenous women. Many writers expressed similar concerns climate and constellations on Europeans. Spanish physician Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez, who served as New Spain's first 'protom\u00e9dico' or chief medical officer in the same years that L\u00f3pez de Velasco compiled his report, was one of a number who expressed comparable views. 'Let us hope that the men who are born [in Europe] and who begin to occupy those regions, whether their parents are Spanish or from some different nation, do not in obedience to the heavens degenerate to the point of adopting the customs of the Indians', he noted in his study of new-world materia medica. [9](#c00342-1-22) Colonial writers were not in agreement about whether the new world's climate was intrinsically bad, but many suspected that it was unhealthy for Europeans, simply because different. [The clearest evidence for the deleterious impact of the all European writers believed had at some point in the past migrated to the Americas from the old world, although their precise place of origin and the mode of transport remained in dispute. Some maintained that Amerindians were one of the lost tribes of Israel, while others argued that they descended from they Indies by sea or instead crossed overland from the Far East. Some writers, perplexed of indigenous cultures, believed peoples must had different origins. Thus the ancestors of the inhabitants of Hispaniola perhaps came from Carthage, while the Peruvians might have originated in the legendary land of Ophir.] [10](#c00342-1-23) Evidence to support one or another position was sought in linguistic analysis, biblical exegesis and perceived cultural Acosta for example noted that 'ignorant people commonly believe that the Indians from the race of Jews because they cunning and lying'. [11](#c00342-1-24) these led the friar Ger\u00f3nimo since church doctrine all men descended from and Noah.] [13](#c00342-1-26) Hence it was important to explain why people who had originated in the old world now looked and behaved so differently from the Spanish. For example, asked themselves, why Amerindian men extensive discussion of this question, Gregorio Garc\u00eda, whose views colour were considered in a previous paragraph, hypothesised that over time the hot climate of the new world impeded their growth. This raised the terrifying prospect that Spanish too, might lose their prized beards as a result of living in the same environment. Beards were considered signal mark of manhood by sixteenth-century Spaniards. Writers insisted that they were a gift from God to beautify and adorn the male face. Beyond this, their existence correlated directly the to produce was essentially to be unmanned. [14](#c00342-1-27) at hand. affirmed possibility was in the virtue Spaniards in inherited from their fathers and grandfathers' was continually reinforced through the consumption of Spanish food. Their constitution, he explained, was protected by 'good food and sustenance such as lamb, chicken, turkey, and good beef, wheat bread, and wine, and nourishing consists almost entirely of old-world foods absent from the Indies before the arrival of Europeans. Only turkeys are indigenous to the Americas; all the other items were introduced by European settlers after 1492. Amerindian men therefore could not possibly have protected their beards from the destructive effects of the American climate, all the more so given that the foods that were available prior to the arrival of Europeans were in Garc\u00eda's view singularly inadequate, consisting as they of cassava, and other foods 'of very little nourishment'.] [15](#c00342-1-28) It was through eating this inadequate food, together with the effect of the unhealthful new-world environment, that the Indians had lost their old-world temperament. The result was the was thus centuries agreed that people who travelled from Europe to the Indies were liable to undergo a variety of transformations, in accordance with the nature and celestial influence of the climate and as a result of eating new foods. In the Indies, as one writer put it, there were 'different regions, different climates, different medicines, different complexions, different foods and for this reason different subjects'. [16](#c00342-1-29) A change in food, like a change in climate, was thus likely to provoke a change in character. [Diet could be controlled, but altering the climate was more difficult. If colonists in the Indies were to retain their Spanish constitution, they needed to look to Humoral the based fundamentally on the principles of humoralism. This section sketches out its central features, for humoralism provided the framework that shaped Spanish understandings of how all bodies functioned. Long standing European medical tradition held that good health required a balance of the four humours that governed the blood, phlegm, humour being either hot or either moist or dry, and was thus naturally linked to one of the four elements out of which all substances were formed. Blood was associated with hot, moist air, phlegm with cold, wet water, black bile with cold, dry earth and yellow bile with hot, dry fire. Each humour was further associated with a different season of the year, certain constellations and a variety of other categories. These may be arrayed schematically, as shown in [Figure](#c00342-1-12) 2, which is based on a drawing from a seventh-century manuscript by Bishop Isidore of Seville. [17](#c00342-1-30) The human body was thus linked macrocosm through the doctrine Individuals possessed a humoral balance determine their 'complexion', a term that referred equally to their character bodily qualities. People in whom black bile predominated were likely to be thin, dark and melancholy. Those with a predominance of blood were generally ruddy, outgoing and optimistic. Personality and physical appearance, in were both was an individual complexion, but a variety of external forces could alter their humoral makeup. Climate, or 'air', was one of these; food was another. These, together with patterns of exercise, sleeping, evacuation (which as profound. Many Corrupted of any sort could be corrected by bloodletting, while an appropriate purge or of exercise. This significance of the six non-naturals on individual character was explained clearly by the German cosmographer Henrico Mart\u00ednez, who spent a number of years in Mexico City. In his 1606 Reportorio de los tiempos e historia natural desta Nueva Espa\u00f1a (Almanac of the Climate and Natural History of this New Spain) Mart\u00ednez asked why it was that people living under the same stars might have different complexions. The answer, he explained, was was determined by many factors, including diversity of the foods which people themselves', and their different exercise regimes and different emotional an individual's altered during of life. generally held to be colder and drier than the young.) These factors together explained the great complexions and a given region.] [19](#c00342-1-32) [Climate, in other words, was but one a number of forces shaping the individual constitution.] [As one Indeed, for many early modern medical writers, food was the single most important factor shaping human health. The conviction that diet was the key to maintaining good health reflected long-standing medical beliefs; Aristotle had, after all, explained that food was central to health because blood, the most important fluid of all, was generated through digestion.] [20](#c00342-1-33) Life sustained by the natural heat and characteristic a healthy body, was indeed entirely dependent on diet, for it was food, substance Michael notes, 'the stomach assumed a position of particular importance in early modern regimes of mental and physical health'. [22](#c00342-1-35) Food should of course nourish the body - the best foods were those that were both easily digestible and nutritious - but it could also be used to modify and correct the complexion. In general people were advised to match diet curantur: conditions cured by opposite. cold and damp, could improve their well-being by eating hot, dry foods such as black pepper. Melancholics (cold and dry, and governed by bile) were advised to eat hot, moist foods such as sugar. Food thus possessed an inherently medicinal aspect, and a change in diet, like a change in environment, could transform an foods, or by living in a very damp region, or through being old', as the Spanish doctor Juan de C\u00e1rdenas noted in 1591.

Spanish doctors liked to cite Hippocrates' warning that even healthy people could be harmed by usual hot beverage, while ill.] [24](#c00342-1-37) Only with great care should an individual use diet - or any other non-natural intervention - to basic complexion, thereby nature'. Indeed, for this argued that it was best to ensure that one's normal diet was not too limited, as otherwise the slightest disturbance in the availability of food could prove dangerous. It was better slowly to accustom oneself to a variety of foods rather than be reliant on only a handful of foodstuffs. [25](#c00342-1-38) The human body was thus to transform into another, an occurrence made all the more likely by the fact that the different humours were in any event locked in a constant struggle to dominate the individual body. [26](#c00342-1-39) Moreover, because of the influence of food and air on the human constitution, bodies, far from being hermetically sealed off from the outside world, were continually open to the impact of their external environment. 'All bodies are Transpirable and Trans-fluxible, that is, so open to the ayre as that it may easily passe and repasse through study of humoralism in early modern England, 'solubility' was the 'sine qua of migrated to the Indies. Humoral bodies were thus inherently unstable and mutable. Little wonder Spaniards in the Indies worried about their diet.] A brief history of humoralism The origins of humoral medicine date back to the writings of ancient Greek healers, in modern doctors constantly alluded in their own works. The corpus of Hippocratic writings - that is to say, the collection of texts by various authors produced between the fifth century bc and the first century ad and generically ascribed to the fifth-century bc very diverse treatment. When in later centuries writers referred to Hippocrates they generally had in mind two works: On the Nature of Man and On Airs, Waters and Places. These texts introduced the idea that good health required a balance of the four humours, and that changes in environment, diet, exercise, rest and overall attitude could individualised 'regimen' aimed at correcting imbalances among others developed the Hippocratic focus on the humours, which he incorporated into his general schema whereby all substances, and in particular all living things, were understood to be composed of four elements, earth, air, water and fire, which were themselves associated with the solid, the fluid, the hot and the cold. Of the humours Aristotle accorded a particular importance to blood, which he considered fundamental to determining the temperament and health of all living things. [30](#c00342-1-43) Writing nearly a thousand years later Bishop Isidore of Seville reflected Aristotle's views when he asserted that the for health (sanitas) and blood (sanguis) were cognate so as to reflect the intimate connection between the two. [31](#c00342-1-44) Blood continued to occupy a position of first among equals in early modern medicine. [32](#c00342-1-45) Nonetheless, since the days of Hippocrates it was believed vital to maintain a balance between blood and the other humours. Hippocratic ideas about humours, and much else, were writers, emphasised the importance of diet to the Muslim kingdoms from southern to Persia, where scholars read and debated Greek texts on medicine and many other topics. In particular, al-Rz (Rhazes) and Ibn Sn (Avicenna), such as Hunayn ibn Ishq created the version of Galenic medicine that dominated medieval and early modern Europe. Avicenna's Canon, a collection of five books dedicated to different aspects of human health, was a cornerstone of university education in Western Europe throughout this period and was for this reason constantly copied and printed.] [33](#c00342-1-46) Rhazes, Avicenna, Averro\u00ebs and formed part of the corpus century. They were joined by Christian physicians such as Arnau de Vilanova, an influential and prolific thirteenth-century Catalan doctor who taught at the University of Montpellier, served as royal physician to three kings of Aragon and composed dozens of widely disseminated medical texts. Galenic medicine as it was understood in early modern Spain was thus the creation of writers from ancient Greece, writers endured late seventeenth century, when new models for understanding health and the human body began to replace the mutable humoral body. The longevity of humoralism as an explanatory system surely owes something to that very mutability, for as the medical historian Vivian Nutton has of observation'.] [35](#c00342-1-48) The interactions between the six non-naturals and the individual body were indeed enormously complex - the same food might produce very [different effects in different bodies, same substance would vary over the course of a their own lifetime. Nonetheless humoralism provided a robust system understanding character premised on an assumption of continual interaction between the body and its environment. This flexible system underpinned the ways early modern Spaniards understood both their own bodies and the bodies of the new peoples they encountered the educated both Europe and the new world, for Catholic Spain had long engaged with the traditions of both and a in reintroducing the works of Galen and Aristotle into Western medicine by translating Arabic versions of these works into Latin, as the original Greek texts were rarely preserved in Christian libraries. At the same time, men such as the twelfth-century Gerard of Cremona began to translate the works of Avicenna and Rhazes into Latin. Gerard was based in Toledo, in the Caliphate of Cordoba, where he learned Arabic and devoted his life to translating the vast corpus of Arabic medical and scientific scholarship into Latin. Spanish scholars continued to play dissemination of and Arabic Western Europe. Not humoralism was firmly embedded in the medical models taught at the major Spanish universities. [36](#c00342-1-49) At the University of Salamanca, established in the early thirteenth century by Alfonso IX, medicine was taught from at least the fourteenth century, and perhaps both Galenic and scholars. [37](#c00342-1-50) A chair of medicine was established at the University of Valencia at the [time of its founding in 1499, and the curriculum again revolved around Avicenna and Galen; when Luis Collado took up a chair in medicine in 1547 his contract stipulated that he was to teach the works of both these scholars, for example.] [38](#c00342-1-51) A separate chair of Hippocratic 1567, which reflects the growing influence of humanist medicine, with its emphasis on accessing the original Greek versions of classical medical statutes stated that professors must teach the works of Hippocrates and Galen, but made no mention by humoralism as the correct model for understanding the human body. Neither advocated a root-and-branch assault on Galenic medicine of the by early sixteenth-century Swiss iconoclast Paracelsus, whose Iberian world until [Humoralism also underpinned the medical texts published in early modern Spain, which is not surprising as university-trained doctors were responsible for penning estimates such titles were printed between 1475 and 1599.] [42](#c00342-1-55)) Most of these works were written in Latin and were aimed at other doctors. Nonetheless, by the sixteenth century a of were less role of the six non-naturals in governing the body and suggested practical ways to regulate and maintain health. Sleeping first on the right-hand side, and then shifting to the left, with a final stint on the right, was regarded as most conducive to good health and digestion, for example. In regard to diet, readers were advised on what when quite detail. provided the ratio was not less than two parts wine to [one part water, and that the best salads combined a variety of different herbs. It was better to eat heavy, indigestible foods such as beef prior to consuming lighter, more foods, rather than the other way around, and postprandial siestas were to be avoided. The dangers of overeating were constantly stressed, which in itself reveals the class of reader at which these books were aimed.] [Some of these works represented entirely literary de Avila1530]()Banquete de nobles (The Knights' Banquet), Pedro de Mercado's [Reference Mercado1574]()Di\u00e1logos de philosophia natural y moral (Dialogues of and Moral Philosophy), Francisco Nu\u00f1ez de Oria's [Reference Nu\u00f1ez de Oria1586]()Regimiento y aviso de sanidad (Regimen and Health Advice) and Blas Alvarez Miraval's [Reference Alvarez Miraval1597]()La conservaci\u00f3n de la salud del cuerpo y del alma (Conservation of Bodily and Spiritual Health), all of Avila's was reprinted doctors when these are lacking but there is great need for them' might combine a list of specific remedies ('how you will heal a pain in the eyes and head') with a brief 'regimen' the explained how often to take exercise, when to eat, and so on, and were often adapted freely from famous medieval authors usually figured prominently in Vilanova's fourteenth-century Regimen sanitatis ad regem aragonum (Health Regime King of Aragon), written for the Aragonese monarch Jaime II, and the medical handbook El tesoro de los pobres (Treasury of Health) ascribed to Pedro Hispano, who later became Pope John XXI. [44](#c00342-1-57) Many other [works that were not devoted explicitly to issues of physical and spiritual health also discussed the principles of humoralism, as it formed part of the basic epistemological framework that shaped all knowledge in the early modern era. For example, Pedro Mex\u00eda's Silva de varia lecci\u00f3n (Collection of of humours and their impact on the individual complexion, sandwiched of the remarkable properties of and other useful pieces of information. Mex\u00eda's work proved very through multiple reprintings.] [45](#c00342-1-58) [It is clear that ideas about the humoral body extended far beyond the university. Literate healers, whatever their academic training, could read manuals of the sort mentioned above, and there is plenty of evidence that even untrained physicians owned the works of Avicenna, in particular. Beyond humoral practices shared even by 'empirical', illiterate practitioners and by the public who consulted them. Indeed it was stipulated in the contracts that towns drew up with particular physicians that the latter would provide useful Similarly, ideas about the causes of were the learned and the unlettered alike. When plague struck Barcelona in 1651, the master tanner Miquel Parets reported that many people suspected that it was due in part to the position of the moon, a standard element of learned explanations purge the body and maintain health, a view with which trained doctors concurred. [48](#c00342-1-61) As the medical historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pi\u00f1ero observed, popular culture in Spain shared many directly to the central figures of Galenic medicine, while at the same time stressing the importance of diet to the maintenance of Avicenna Sermons, too, ideas about the Galenic body through their frequent comparisons of sin to a bodily illness, and analogies. [51](#c00342-1-64) Overall the idea of complexion composed of a balance of hot, cold, wet and dry, and influenced by the six non-naturals was part of the common currency of early modern Europe. [52](#c00342-1-65) Humoralism in the new world Each bloodletting cost me a peso, and a purge ten. [53](#c00342-1-66) Humoralism was thus part of the intellectual baggage that colonists took with them to the Indies. Churchmen and other learned individuals were of course familiar with its basic principles. Indeed, Diego Alvarez Chanca, who accompanied Columbus on his second journey, probably studied medicine at the University of Salamanca and composed several medical texts in addition to an influential discovery letter. [54](#c00342-1-67) Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas incorporated an extensive discussion of humoral theory, including the importance (Apologetic a lengthy analysis not surprisingly, human body in humoral terms.

[58](#c00342-1-71)) and other prophylactic measures, as they would have done in Spain. Thus in 1529 Diego Delgadillo, a judge in Mexico's first Audiencia, or high court, arranged for his servants to be bled and purged a year after his arrival in Mexico, although he regarded the cost as excessive. 'Each bloodletting cost me a peso, and a purge ten,' he complained. [59](#c00342-1-72) As the anthropologist George Foster has in colonial Spanish America 'humoral concepts permeated the assumptions not only educated and intellectual people'. [60](#c00342-1-73) In fact, in the new world, as in Spain, it was not only the highly educated who dwelt in a humoral universe. Understandings of population. Members of the Audiencia were not the only ones who resorted to bleedings and purges when ill. Indeed one Spanish settler in the town of Tepic, in northern Mexico, observed that in such frontier that most men could also chair, cut out a suit, castrate a steer, prepare a stew and mount a lawsuit.) The Spanish captain Vargas Machuca, the author of a treatise on how to organise and run a military expedition in the Indies, similarly noted that in places where there were no doctors everyone knew how to let blood, mix medicines and administer purges. Since 'everyone is so skilled' in these matters, he explained, there was no need for his handbook to treat the subject in any doctors could invoke the name of Galen. A man investigated for practising medicine without a licence in seventeenth-century Colombia assured the authorities that 'in all the cures I have effected I have always guided myself by the doctrine of Galen and other famous modern authors'.] to the specific circumstances of the Indies, but the basic model remained the same.

As far as Gage was concerned this was completely inappropriate, for, as he pointed out to the doctor, 'the natural quality of that meat [is] to open the body'. 'I had expected some piece of mutton, or or some other nourishing might work upon a man's body in other nations, it worked not there, but the contrary'. [65](#c00342-1-78) Both Gage Vargas Machuca, and the other inhabitants of colonial Spanish America gained their understanding of the humoral body through a variety of means. As in Europe, sermons provided a regular opportunity to ideas about priests were often quite explicit in their discussion of management. The Dominican Pedro de Feria, for instance, explained in a published sermon that 'when a man suffers from some bodily ailment he must take a purge to expel the bad humours that cause the illness'. He continued that in like fashion, 'after a man has sinned he must take the purge of penitence to expel the sickness in his [66](#c00342-1-79) orations thus informed how to treat more mundane disorders. In diagnosing Mexico City, where the first printing press arrived in 1539, was a particularly important centre of publication. In contrast to the situation in early modern Spain, where more than half the medical publications were in Latin, only three of the nine medical works published in sixteenth-century Mexico were in Latin. The majority were vernacular works aimed at a lay readership. aimed at learned people. Gregorio L\u00f3pez's 1673 Tesoro de medicina para diversas enfermedades (Medical Treasury for Diverse Ailments), for example, pointed out explained the division of substances into hot, cold, wet and dry, and other elements of basic humoral theory.

[70](#c00342-1-83) [In short, in colonial Spanish America, as in early modern Europe, the humoral body underpinned both popular and learned understandings of health and character among the settler population.

They were very far from stable.] 'They are delicate and feminine thus provided and why Indian bodies and the bodies of Spaniards resident in the Indies were different, despite the common environment.

[79](#c00342-1-92) Cuneo thus provides an example Indians were either phlegmatic or melancholic, the indeed generally categorised Amerindians as phlegmatic, which made only occasionally distinguished among D\u00edaz de Islas, a Spanish doctor who composed an early tract on the treatment of syphilis, were 'delicate and feminine and of weak complexion', and died age attributed entirely to their inadequate diet: [They do not have the habit of eating meat, as there was none in that land aside from some little animals like rabbits, which were not enough for everyone anyway, and some parrots, and as a result they ate fishes and worms that grow in the earth, and they didn't have any wine and for this reason they died so young.] [82](#c00342-1-95) He noted being raised hearty foods such as meat and wine and wheat bread and hearty things'. Their different from indigenous bodies was explained with great clarity by Diego Andr\u00e9s Rocha in his 1681 treatise on the 'origin of the Indians'. Rocha, a Spaniard who taught law at the Peruvian University of San Marcos, and also served on the Audiencia de Lima, advanced the view that Amerindians were descended from ancient Spaniards who had travelled to the new world in the remote past. Given their common ancestry Rocha needed to explain why it was that Amerindians now differed so dramatically from Spaniards. Drawing heavily on the analysis provided a century earlier by the Dominican priest Gregorio Garc\u00eda, he argued that this was due to 'the variation airs and in colour, size, gestures and faces among Americans, who did not conserve the colour of the first Spaniards who came to these Indies ... because their ancestors enjoyed different climates, different waters, different foods, which at first were not very nourishing, and it was a great achievement that they did not die of hunger until such time as they managed to cultivate fruits and other forms of food, and this is what caused the variation among peoples and in colour [83](#c00342-1-96) Rocha stressed by the new climate, but rather by 'the lack of protection from the weather, bad foods, and over a long period'. For this reason alone creoles remained white, despite their lengthy residence in the new world. their complexion was continually reinforced, raised with much care and protection and with good foods, which was not the case with the Indians and those who first came to this America'. [84](#c00342-1-97) Good food trumped climate. A change in climate could thus be managed through careful attention to diet, but the same could not be said for a change in diet. The latter, Rocha stressed, could have devastating consequences for the individual complexion, and for this reason it was essential for creoles and Europeans living in the Indies to eat appropriately. Eating the wrong food and living unprotected in the American environment had mistakes of their ancestors. 'Here we have seen very white men from Spain', Rocha warned, 'who, on withdrawing into the hills and eating maize and other Indian dainties, return so toasted that they resemble Indians.'] [85](#c00342-1-98) vital the distance between Spaniards (and creoles) and Indians. It was through eating the wrong foods that ancient Spaniards had turned into toasted and discoloured Indians, food would sooner or later was therefore the principal bulwark protecting the Spanish body from the rigours of the American climate. For this reason it was also the principal force preventing Spaniards from turning into Indians. 'Race', in other in part a question digestion.] Practical fell they could not eat familiar foods, and conversely asserted that only the restoration of their usual diet would heal them. Recall Columbus's 1494 letter to the Catholic monarchs with which this book began, which ascribed the demise of Spanish settlement on Hispaniola to the combined effects of climate, hunger and unfamiliar food. This in fact was the most common explanation for the fiasco in Hispaniola. The admiral's son Fernando, for example, insisted that the settlers were 'made ill by the climate and diet of that country'. [86](#c00342-1-99) The Dominican priest, chronicler and political agitator Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas agreed. In his account of settlement he settlers fell sick because of 'change in air and the very different location ... to which must be added the rationing of supplies, which were distributed according to a strict rota, as they were brought from Spain. As for the local foods, because they were so different from ours - especially the bread - there was no hope that our men could tolerate them, and as a result they began to 'more subtle air and thinner waters and different foods, all of which, in short, were so distinct from our own'. [88](#c00342-1-101) [In his own discussion of the disastrous settlement in Hispaniola the Spanish chronicler and colonial official Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo agreed that the high European death toll was due primarily to the change in diet. Oviedo, a native of Madrid, travelled to the Caribbean in the early sixteenth century to take charge of the gold-smelting operations underway in the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. During the next three decades he composed a lengthy history of the new world, in which he drew on both his many years' residence in the Caribbean and the access to state documents made possible by his eventual appointment as Charles V's official chronicler of the Indies. The result, Oviedo's Historia general y natural de las Indias] [ (General and Natural History of the Indies), is an idiosyncratic work that covers matters ranging from Magellan's circumnavigation of the world to the qualities the [89](#c00342-1-102) Among many settlement on proved so unsuccessful. In Oviedo's view the fundamental problem on Hispaniola was that 'the foods and bread of Spain are more substantial than the herbs and bad eating that they like over there'. As a consequence, the health of the settlers was so compromised that even those who survived to return to Spain died shortly thereafter. [90](#c00342-1-103) He summed up the dangerous features of the new world as follows: Beyond the incongruity that the heavens there have with those of Europe (where we were born), and the influence of the differences in the airs and vapours and nature of the land, we found in these parts no foods that were like those that our fathers gave us: the bread - of roots, the fruits - wild or unknown and unsuitable for our stomachs, the water - of a different flavour, the meats - there were none on [Hispaniola], beyond those mute rodents or a few other animals, and all very different from those of Spain. [91](#c00342-1-104) Unlike university-trained writers, Oviedo did not frame Galen or his observations as the outcome of first-hand experience in the new world, which taught him that the air, water and food of the Americas were not suited to European was unhealthy and dangerous (at least for Europeans). The conquistador Bernardo de Vargas Machuca thus reported matter-of-factly that leaders of arrivals from Spain, of the land [and] ... its they likely to grow sick die.] [92](#c00342-1-105) The governor of the small Spanish settlement at Santa Elena, in Florida, likewise believed that reliance on new-world foods was responsible for the sickness that plagued the Insisting that his subjects' shattered health would be restored only by a return to their usual diet, he arranged for supplies of wheat flour, wine and olive oil to be sent from Spain. [93](#c00342-1-106) And even when they did not die Spaniards who relied on new-world foods were liable to suffer Madrile\u00f1o Celed\u00f3n Favalis a healthy during his journey across Panama, given that he had been forced to rely on hearts of palm and other dangerous forest fruits, but his luck ran out when he boarded ship for Peru. The voyage was beset by difficulties and the passengers were exposed to continual rainfall and reduced to swellings. As a result, by the time he arrived in Lima, he informed his father in a letter from 1587, 'my body was one enormous sore'. [94](#c00342-1-107) The Jesuit chronicler Cobo, who many years in up the situation. new-world foods on the European constitution was offered by children suckled by indigenous wet nurses. The use of indigenous and enslaved women to nurse creole children was widespread in the Indies. Just as in Europe, all but the poorest families aspired to employ years.) Wet nursing was nonetheless a contentious topic in both Europe the Americas. Breast milk was a powerful substance, believed to was essentially to imbibe their humours. For this reason it was widely believed that children took on the qualities of those from whom they nursed. As the Spanish doctor Blas Alvarez Miraval explained, it was largely from breast milk that children derived their 'good or bad habits, their good or bad complexion, their cleverness or their laudable [97](#c00342-1-110) Writers recounted stories of to restrain themselves from vomit, of men nursed by pigs who were given to rolling in the mud, and similarly bizarre and undesirable consequences of ingesting the wrong sort of milk. These effects made themselves felt in animals as well; sheep fed with goat's milk had coarser wool. [98](#c00342-1-111) In the case of creole children nursed by indigenous or black women the effect was to endow these children with indigenous or African characteristics. [Discussing the consequences of nursing a creole boy milk, the Spanish Dominican Reginaldo de Liz\u00e1rraga complained:] How will this boy turn out? He will adopt the inclinations that he absorbed from the milk on which he was nursed, and he will become like the person with whom he associated, as we see occurring every day. He who is nursed on lying milk becomes a liar. He who drinks drunken milk becomes a drunkard, and thieving milk, a thief. [99](#c00342-1-112) He recommended that for this reason the use of indigenous and black wet nurses be prohibited altogether. Writing at the turn of the seventeenth century, another Spanish priest commented that boys raised on Indian milk 'differ little from Indians'. [100](#c00342-1-113) A decades later the of everyone could the difference between Spaniards and 'those who are raised on the milk of those Indian women'. The latter, he felt, an intrinsically new-world Indeed, in some sense it was itself derivative of maize, or cassava, or whatever substance formed the bulk of the nurse's diet, for the maize that nourished the woman was converted by the digestive process into blood, and hence women would teach their bad habits to the children they raised. Much more seriously, colonists worried that the very nature their children's transformed through individual's humoral balance. As the Guatemalan to their offspring. 'We see that this milk not only corrupts and contaminates the humours but would like indigenous nurses, perceived between diet and the with for worry about what would happen to their bodies in the new world. The porous humoral body was vulnerable to the powerful influence of unfamiliar foods, just as it was subject to the astrological and climatic forces exerted by the stars and the air. A sudden change in either was liable to induce possibly fatal illness. Equally worryingly, even when it did not cause sickness, either was apt to provoke serious and unwelcome changes in the individual constitution. Travel to the Indies subjected the European body to both. It thus posed a substantial challenge to the European complexion. As one medical writer put it, 'going to the Indies is contrary to the human constitution'. [103](#c00342-1-116) Little wonder, then, that settlers viewed maize and cassava with about the consequences diet, for it was an unfortunate combination of air and food that was choleric, bearded Europeans into phlegmatic, beardless about the origins of the indigenous population may have been confined largely to the educated elite, fears about the practical impact of eating new-world foods were not. As we saw, writers with no medical training whatsoever regarded new-world foods as un-nourishing, and blamed them 'that our fathers gave whenever that Spaniards would begin to transform into Amerindians if they ate the wrong foods. By way of conclusion we might consider the experiences of Jer\u00f3nimo de was in Andalusia in the late fifteenth century and travelled to the Indies sometime in the early sixteenth century. In 1511 he was sailing from Panama towards Santo Domingo when his ship was caught in a storm and foundered off the Yucatan Peninsula. Aguilar, along with several companions, was captured by local Maya Indians, with whom he lived until 1519, when he was rescued by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Following his return to Spanish society, Aguilar was offered European food, but, to the surprise of his rescuers, he ate only sparingly. When asked why he was so moderate he explained that 'after so much time he was accustomed to the food of the Indians, and his stomach would regard Christian food as foreign'.] Indians had to tolerate normal digestive had gone in humoral terms, had acquired a 'second nature', and as a result, his body was not quite as Christian as it had been prior to his shipwreck. He had begun to turn into an Indian. It was to avoid such calamities that the Spanish settlers in Santa Elena, Florida, grew wheat and garbanzos alongside maize, and that writers recommended that when travelling to the Indies men would be wise to bring their own food, 'because neither wheat bread nor wine is to be found those parts'.
