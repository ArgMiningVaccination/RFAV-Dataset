It is a sickness that festers in the hearts and minds of nearly half of our population, and has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people, the gender-based terrorizing of women and children, the brutalization of persons of color, and the forceful deportation of persons born on the soil of other nations. There is a cure for this toxic form of masculinity that is life-giving, that seeks the welfare of others, that respects and cares for the earth and all its creatures. It is the way of thinking, acting, and being that was lived and taught by Jesus of Nazareth two millennia ago. He taught it to his male it with his female disciples. Detox! speaks to the men of today in the words that Jesus spoke to the men of his day, addressing the same situations that face modern and domination. Detox! gives you the same practical spiritual tools and life applications that Jesus gave his followers. Use them to bless the world. "}
