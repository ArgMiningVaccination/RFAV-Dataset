Yet what if an existing vaccine could make COVID-19 less deadly? A study just published put the theory to test, with promising results. A research team led by Dr. Larenas-Linnemann working at Medica Sur, Mexico City, reported on their clinical observations in 255 subjects vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine since the start of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many vaccinated patients were contracted COVID-19, thus at extremely high risk. Thirty-six of the patients have now contracted COVID-19, but their health and age. The paper, published in the September issue of Allergy, the European Journal of a measles outbreak At start COVID-19 pandemic, observing the highly contagious and virulent nature of the virus and the lack of available preventive measures, the investigators the immune system a boost to prepare it for a variety of assaults. Since COVID-19 was new to humans, there was no existing treatment or vaccine to specifically fight it. But Dr. Larenas-Linnemann, being Dutch and having done her basic training in the Netherlands, had followed with admiration the work of a fellow countryman on pathogen, after being exposed (by natural illness) non-related pathogen; cytokines. means that, surprisingly, the target disease (such as but also immunity is a form of non-specific immunity. It controversial at first, but after decades of pioneering fieldwork from a Danish team studying the tuberculosis vaccine and the live polio vaccine in both Northern Europe and Africa, followed by years of authoritative laboratory work from Dr. Larenas-Linnemann's countryman Mihai Netea and others, it is now accepted that certain live-attenuated vaccines can make the body better prepared to fight off a range of pathogens. Dr. Larenas-Linnemann's team wondered: Could a live-attenuated vaccine be protective against entirely new disease, COVID-19, for their patients? Taking advantage of the fact that the pandemic in Mexico coincided with a rise in measles cases, which had motivated the Ministry of Health to recommend measles re-vaccination, the team decided to put the concept of trained immunity to the test. As such, from March cases. Observational MMR for COVID-19 prevention In a prospective observational trial in Hospital M\u00e9dica Sur, ranked since 2011 as the best hospital of Mexico City, the team gave their patients boosters of a standard childhood vaccine, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), which is considered safe worldwide (a booster is even required in many places to start college or military service). The patients were followed closely to watch for COVID-19 infection. The patients were considered high risk for COVID infection because many were caring for ill family members and were vulnerable due to their age or other risk factors. COVID-19 infection was considered confirmed with detection of specific antibodies, or the combined presence of a direct contact with a confirmed case plus anosmia/ageusia and at least two classic COVID-19 symptoms. Direct contact with a confirmed case, accompanied by classic but without smell considered cases. COVID-19 was graded on a simplified scale from zero for asymptomatic cases, through 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for lower respiratory symptoms without the need for oxygen, up to 6 vaccinated subjects, there confirmed and 12 (highly) probable COVID-19 cases, thirteen with risk factors that can often make COVID-19 more serious (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, or uncontrolled asthma). In ivermectin the cases were less severe than would be expected. All had most. Only one patient, with uncontrolled asthma, had one day of mild low blood oxygen. No patients had respiratory vaccination, seemed to help our older adult said Aaby, of Bandim Health Project Centre Vitamins and Vaccines (CVIVA), Statens Serum Institut, a governmental public health and research institution under the Danish Ministry of Health in Copenhagen, Denmark and a pioneer in the field. \"Together with my partner Dr. Christine now, and arguing for optimized vaccine schedules. With the COVID-19 crisis adding urgency, it's good to the potential exposed health-care reduce the an eventual infection. However, one of the effects described in experiments was a rise in interleukin 6 cytokine (IL-6), which made the M\u00e9dica Sur team reluctant to use this method due to cases. In addition, BCG vaccine and live polio vaccine are not used in the United States of America or Canada, making work with the BCG and critically needed to save infant lives around the globe. Dr. Larenas-Linnemann's team instead chose the MMR vaccine for its safety as data gathered by Dr. Larenas-Linnemann and her group in Mexico City, demonstrating a milder course of COVID-19 to contacts of COVID-19 and plan to keep collecting data on further clinical cases. They are also searching for cooperation with basic immunologists to study the immunologic background of their observations. Said Dr. Larenas-Linnemann, \"We are grateful to be able to have been able to offer this to our patients and hope these first real-life data will spark interest in the approach.\" Conclusive evidence of the value vaccine to reduce COVID-19 complications requires a prospective, randomized trial. This is exactly what microbiologist Dr. Paul Fidel of Louisiana State University has recently launched. He has hypothesized that severe COVID-19 cases, as outlined in an [opinion/hypothesis piece in mBio](https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/3/e00907-20). With funding from Parsemus Foundation Fast in the hard-hit New Orleans region. Dr. Fidel's team is still seeking to test whether MMR provide protection to residents, who are particularly vulnerable to this disease. ### About the Center of Excellence in Asthma and Allergy [Clinica en Alergia y Asma was accredited as a Center of Excellence by GA2LEN in May 2016](http://dralarenas.com/curriculum-ing.html). In March 2017, the clinic was renamed and officially established as the Centro de Excelencia en Asma y Alergia Larenas, and now both conducts research and provides advanced care to adults and children with allergic diseases, including asthma. The Center was recertified as a Center of Excellence in 2019 and is located within the office tower of the Hospital Medica Sur, in Mexico City. About Medica Sur [Medica Sur](https://healthtravelmexico.com/eng_index.php#) is a highly specialized health institution made up of medical, diagnostic, research, teaching and social assistance units. Medica Sur brings a select group of professionals from medicine, nursing, administration and hospital operations, who - guided by a strict code of ethics and backed by cutting-edge technologies - aim to offer its patients medical excellence with a human touch. Medica Sur was the first hospital outside the United States to be part of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, thereby promoting collaboration between physicians to improve medical care for all their patients in Mexico.

About Parsemus Foundation Parsemus Foundation works to create meaningful improvements in human and animal health and welfare by advancing innovative and neglected medical research, with advances change treatment practice rather than disappearing into the scientific literature. Many of the studies the foundation supports involve low-cost approaches that are not under patent. Focus areas include reproductive health, animal reproductive health, and COVID-19 prevention and treatment. More information on the Parsemus Foundation and its work can be found "}
