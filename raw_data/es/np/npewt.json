Esto a su vez, permitir \u00b4a dise nar y fabricar detectores m \u00b4as ecientes para aplicaciones tecnol \u00b4ogicas. 2Contents Introducci \u00b4on La detecci \u00b4on de luz ha sido un tema de gran inter \u00b4es en la f \u00b4sica del \u00b4ultimo siglo, siendo una herramienta necesaria a la hora de medir propiedades de sistemas muy diversos. Detectar luz con precisi \u00b4on y abilidad es de suma importancia en aplicaciones de caracter cient \u00b4co (obtener mejores instrumentos de medida) y de car \u00b4acter tecnol \u00b4ogico, con una gran var- iedad de sensores y aparatos que hoy aparecen en nuestro vida cotidiana. Hoy en d \u00b4a, el reto es detectar luz en su expresi \u00b4on fundamental, el fot \u00b4antico por lo que este desaf \u00b4o cae dentro del campo de la \u00b4optica cu \u00b4antica, en la que nos apoyaremos para desarrollar este proyecto. Actualmente existe una gran demanda de instrumentaci \u00b4on que permita detectar un \u00b4unico fot\u00b4on con gran resoluci \u00b4on temporal y espacial, para \u00b4ogicos como del espacio \u00b4on de im \u00b4agenes cu \u00b4antica [5]. En este trabajo caracterizaremos un tipo de detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico, basado en un cable de dimensiones nanom \u00b4etricas que colocamos en un estado superconductor. Al mantener este cable ligeramente por debajo de su corriente cr \u00b4tica superconductora, la llegada de uno o m\u00b4as fotones puede romper el estado superconductor del material, generando un cambio medible en nuestro circuito que deniremos como \"detecci \u00b4on de un fot \u00b4on\". Este tipo de detectores, conocidos como SNSPD, ofrecen una eciencia de detecci \u00b4on alta [6], un nivel bajo de cuentas oscuras (o falsas cuentas), un amplio rango de longitudes de onda y otras propiedades deseables como un tiempo corto de reseteo. Esto los convierte en grandes candidatos para las aplicaciones nombradas anteriormente. Generalmente este tipo de de- tectores han sido fabricados en NbN, un superconductor cristalino convenciona. Tambi \u00b4en se proyecto, utilizaremos un SNSPD fabricado de MoSi, el cual es un superconductor de estructura amorfa, a diferencia del NbN. Adem \u00b4as, dispondremos de un detector muy similar fabricado en NbN, con el n de comparar sus propiedades. Es importante se nalar que el mecanismo de detecci \u00b4on, el proceso f \u00b4sico mediante el cual la energ \u00b4a del fot \u00b4on rompe el estado superconductor, no se entiende completamente [15, 16]. Distintos materiales y dise nos de fabricaci \u00b4on de estos detectores se nalan a distintos modelos de detecci \u00b4on existentes [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. La geometr \u00b4a de los dos detectores utilizados en este trabajo est \u00b4a dise nada con el objetivo de localizar las detecciones de fot \u00b4on y comprender sus mecanismos f \u00b4sicos [15, 22]. Con el n de caracterizar la respuesta 5intr\u00b4nseca del detector, se aplica la t \u00b4ecnica de Cu \u00b4antica de Detectores. Este \u00b4atico permite obtener la respuesta completa del nanodetector, incidiendo con pulsos coherentes de luz generados por un l \u00b4aser. Ajustaremos los datos a una funci \u00b4on tomogr \u00b4aca que relaciona la base de estados coherentes j icon la base de Fock jii(o base de n\u00b4umero de fotones), para as \u00b4 obtener la respuesta intr \u00b4nseca del detector. El objetivo de este trabajo es: caracterizar las propiedades superconductoras de nuestro detector de fot \u00b4on \u00b4unico fabricado en MoSi, comparar su rendimiento contando fotones con el de un detector de NbN y con trabajos anteriores realizados con detectores de MoSi. Se muestra la t \u00b4ecnica de Tomograf \u00b4a Cu \u00b4antica de Detector, y se describen dos mejoras al montaje experimental utilizado en la tomograf \u00b4a. 1 Introduction Detecting light has been one of the most prominent topics in Physics over the last century. Many applications have been realized using the classical treatment of light, but the current challenge is to control and manipulate light at its fundamental quantum level. This lies in the eld of Quantum Optics. Light detectors capable of resolving a single photon are the main topic of this work. Since the rst demonstration by Golt'smann in 2011 [23], Superconducting Single prime candidate for quantum optics applications because they combine a very high detection efciency with high counting speed (of the order of GHz). Applications include technological breakthroughs such as quantum key [1], free space communications [2] or imaging developments [4]. The main advantages of these detectors are dark count rate, high detection efciency, wavelength range time to other technologies used to detect single photons, these devices use two superconducting state and biased just below its critical current Ic. The arrival of a photon breaks the superconducting state and leads to a measurable change in the circuit, in the form of a voltage pulse that represents a 'detection event'. To date, most SSPD's have been fabricated in NbN, but they have been nanowire fabricated in MoSi results were obtained different device geometries, which could be for in the outcome of the exper- iments. To account for this, we will study a MoSi nanodetector with a geometry analogous to Ref. compare it earlier on MoSi nanodetector with a different geometry. The geometry of our detector is based around a nanoconstriction, a wedge in the nanowire. This constriction is the most narrow area of the detector (150 nm wide), therefore having the highest critical current density. This makes the nanoconstriction the most efcient part of the detector and we will usually regard it as the only active area. These detectors, called Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors exploring the underlying mechanism that causes the energy of the photon to break the superconducting state. This is an important question, as under- standing which is the underlying photon detection will help and more efcient single photon detectors. The this thesis is properties sults. Detector (QDT) is needed to obtain and the SNSPD. We present this technique and implement changes in the setup in order enhance Previous research conducted at Leiden University [26] has shown this is an essential step towards testing the current models on the detection mechanism for these devices. 72. Metodolog \u00b4a experimental A continuaci \u00b4on, se presentan los m \u00b4etodos experimentales utilizados en este proyecto. Comen- zamos describiendo los detectores de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico que utilizaremos, uno de un superconduc- tor amorfo como MoSi, y otro de NbN, un material superconductor cristalino utilizado am- pliamente en este campo. Ambos detectores tienen una geometr \u00b4a de nanoconstricci \u00b4on. El nanocable por el que circula corriente y donde inciden los fotones, tiene un estrechamiento que constituye la zona activa del detector. Esto se debe a la elevada densidad de corriente en esta constricci \u00b4on. La principal ventaja de dicha geometr \u00b4a es que podemos localizar las detecciones de fot \u00b4on para investigar qu \u00b4e procesos intervienen en ellas. Adem \u00b4as, como la zona activa es muy reducida, aumentan nuestras posibilidades de observar eventos de detecci \u00b4on de varios fotones cercanos. El objetivo principal del experimento es iluminar el detector con luz coherente y reg- istrar su respuesta como pulsos de voltaje que representan fotones detectados. El mon- taje experimental consiste de dos partes bien diferenciadas, el montaje \u00b4optico y el circuito el\u00b4ectrico. En el montaje \u00b4optico, el objetivo ser \u00b4a dirigir la iluminaci \u00b4on del l \u00b4aser hacia el detector, y controlar la misma utilizando una serie de atenuadores, espejos y lentes. As \u00b4 mismo, se usa un prisma para obtener rayos secundarios con los que caracterizar en tiempo real la potencia del l \u00b4aser incidente. El circuito el \u00b4ectrico alimenta al nanodetector con una corriente continua, cerca de la corriente cr \u00b4tica superconductora Ic; a la vez que registra la detecci \u00b4on de fotones como pulsos de corriente alterna, que dirigiremos a una cadena de amplicadores. El detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico se modeliza como un interruptor en paralelo con una resistencia, donde la posici \u00b4on cerrado representa el estado superconductor y la posici \u00b4on abierta representa el estado normal resistivo del aparato. Finalmente, se introduce la Tomograf \u00b4a Cu \u00b4antica de Detectores como un m \u00b4etodo matem \u00b4atico que permite caracterizar la respuesta completa del detector. \u00b4Este m \u00b4etodo se basa en rela- cionar la respuesta del detector a estados coherentes con la respuesta a estados de Fock, estados cu \u00b4anticos con un n \u00b4umero medio de fotones bien denido. Adem \u00b4as, se modica este m\u00b4etodo para facilitar \u00b4on, agrupando todas las fuentes de atenuaci \u00b4on en un \u00b4unico par \u00b4ametro\u0011. Esto reduce enormemente la complejidad del an tomogr \u00b4aco. 82 Setup and methods 2.1 highest current density is concentrated. This constriction is by far the most sensitive area of the SNSPD and we can assume all detection events happening in this active area [27]. These nanodetectors detect single photons when they are biased near their criti- cal current. In this situation, an inciding photon can break the superconducting state with energy, a pulse that constitutes a 'detection event'. The NbN detector has an active area of 150 x 150 nm and 5 nm thickness. The studied MoSi nanodetector has an active area of 210 x 150 nm and it is 4.5 nm thick. Localizing all detection events im- proves which more than one photon hit the nanowire close in both time and space. These multi-photon events give us information about the response of the detector as a function of the total absorbed energy [26, 28]. We a tomographic method investigate the intrinsic response of image of a chip carrier with 8 detectors b) SEM image of the 150 nm wide nanoconstriction. Images provided . NIST (Boulder, EEUU Figure 2.1 shows an optical microscope image of a chip with 8 MoSi nanodetectors (left) and a SEM image of the 150nmwide detector (right). In the rst image, the nanode- tectors can be seen as triangular constrictions around the yellow cross. This cross serves a gold contact pads, that we use to put current through the detectors. The MoSi lm was sputtered on top of a Si wafer, with a SiO 2layer beneath it. In Figure 2.2 we can see the layout for the design of two MoSi nanodetectors, consisting of two meanders and the nanoconstriction or active area. The meander are long zig-zag loops of the same nanowire which act as a coil. Two meandersare added to increase the inductance of the device, in order to avoid a very short reset time that could cause latching of the detector. [29]. These devices were fabricated by Varum Verma at NIST (Boulder, EEUU). More information on the of similar MoSi nanodetectors is available in Refs. [8, 11, 9, 12] 2.2 Optical setup The main goal of the experiment is to characterize the response of the detector, using a range of coherent states. These states are prepared by attenuation of the laser beam, that is then directed into the single photon detector, which is put inside a cryostat. The main quantities under study are: i) the count rate of the detector, ii) the optical power on the detector. The current through the detector is also controlled, using the electric Quantum Detector Tomography on our SNSPD inside the cryostat 2.2 shows a schematic representation of the optical setup, some mirrors source repetition rate of 20 MHz and creates pulses of 20-30 ps duration. We lter nm). table, the laser passes through a crossed polarizer system variable attenuator, allowing pump power. By the polarizers in a perfectly crossed conguration, so the after attenuator is initially zero. The laser beam must also incide perpendicular to the polarizers, in order to achieve maximum tuning range of the Thereafter, the ray is the (BS), which creates secondary rays that we will use to monitor the power and obtain an image of the laser spot on the SNSPD. A secondary ray is collected with a power meter (Thorlabs PM100D). This ray will allow to estimate the optical power on the detector without block- ing the laser beam, using the for the selected wavelenghts (780 nm). On the other arm of the BS, we have a 2x magnication CCD Camera collecting light that comes reaches the camera after reflecting off the beam splitter. This secondary ray, along with a conventional lamp that illuminates inside the cryostat, can be used to image our detector along with the laser beam in real time. The image helps aligning the input laser in order to achieve high count rates. The \u0015=2plate before the window of the cryostat is used to control the polarization of the incoming lens focuses the laser beam on the nanoconstriction of the detector. In the experiments, the polarization will not be changed so the angle of the \u0015=2plate is kept in the conguration that maximizes efciency (with the electrical eld parallel to the nanowire). The cryostat keeps the SNSPD at a pressure of v10\u00007mbar, with a base temperature of v3:5K. 2.3 Electrical circuit The purpose of the electrical circuit behind the detector is multiple. First, a DC current source must be used to bias the nanodetector close to its critical current. Then, the circuit must also read out and amplify the voltage pulses generated by photon detection. Let's start with the equivalent circuit for the nanodetector. The detector is modelled by a switch in parallel with a resistor, of value RN. In series with this, there is an inductor representing the kinetic inductance. This equivalent circuit is represented on the left side of Figure 2.4, and is biased with current Ib. To provide this DC current to the nanodetector, we use a voltage source (Yokogawa GS200) in series with a resistor Rb= 100 . When the detector is superconducting, the switch is closed and the current Ibflows, set by the voltage source and the load resistor. When a photon incides on the nanowire the superconducting state is destroyed, and the switch opens. This generates a voltage peak that needs to be amplied, and consitutes a 'detection event'. The current now sees a big resistance RN, of the order of M s, so it is quickly shunted into the load resistor due to RN>> Rb= 100 . The circuit has now turned into a voltage bias and the cooling of the cryostat can restore the state of the nanowire. The current Ibwill restart flowing through the detector once it is cooled down sufciently. There is another inductor and a capacitor inside a Bias Tee, which lter high frequencies from the current bias before it enters the superconducting single photon detector. This Tee (ZNBT-60-1W) MHz bandwidth, and acts as a low-pass lter for the current source. The second part of this circuit is the readout, amplifying the signal and sending it to an appropiate instrument. To lter out low frequencies from the signal, an extra capacitor is place inside the Bias Tee. We then use a 50 resistance between points A'and B'to match the impedance of the ampliers with the rest of the circuit. Therefore, reflections of the signal at this point are avoided. The signal of the transient is transferred and it is high- pass ltered by the combination of the capacitor Bias Tee, the 50 resistance 12Figure 2.4: Equivalent electrical circuit for the experiment. The shaded area on the left represents the equivalent circuit of the superconducting single photon detector. and the capacitance at the input of the ampliers. Only high frequency signals (20-3000 MHz). This voltage is then fed to a set of two RF ampliers (mini-circuits ZX60-3018G- S+), which are connected to via coaxial cable. Usually, the oscilloscope is substituted by a pulse-counter (Agilent 53131A) in which we set a trigger voltage to discriminate noise. A typical detection event has peak height of around 0.5 mV . Note that the peak height of the pulse is set by the load resistance Rband the bias current used Ib. For very currents, detection events can not be recorded reliably, due to a peak height comparable to the background noise. As mentioned before, resetting the detector is key for this circuit. After photon detec- tion, the switch will be opened due to a resistive barrier happening in the nanowire. This can be seen as a self-heating hotspot where superconductivity is destroyed. The current is directed this timescale whereLKis the kinetic of the nanodetector. At the same time, the cooling power of the cryostat will restore the superconducting the between of resistive area and the cooling power of the cryostat. When the nanowire is again superconducting, the current will promptly flow back through the nanodetector. timescale changes in the current. It arises from the inertia of high mobility carriers (electrons) in AC current [30]. These carriers have a non-zero mass and need to be accelerated. In alternating elds, an effect analogous to resetting timescales for Therefore, it also sets the maximum count rate than can be achieved. An extensive study role SNSPD's a typical detection Shape of pulse, averaged The gray trace shows an individual event Ideally,LKshould be small in order to obtain fast reset times. In practice we cannot thermal accounts power of the cryostat and the intrinsic Joule heating of a detection event. If the current is restored before the device has cooled down sufciently, the superconducting state will not be recov- ered after a detection. The detector will either remain in its normal state or switch between 14the superconducting and normal states indenitely. This is known as 'latching' of the de- photon To avoid this, two were added above and under the nanodetector (see Figure 2.2), in increase LKto value avoid also account for most of the resistance of the detector in its normal state RN. 2.4 Quantum Detector Tomography (QDT) The main tool we will use to characterize our detector is Quantum Detector Tomography is an agnostic non-projective measurement in which we feed the detector with different coherent states by attenuation of the laser illumination, and measure its count rate. The goal is obtaining the click probability of the detector when N photons are incident on it. We probe the detector with a set of coherent states j i, controlling the input power and then we extract the response of the detector to the photon number states jii. This is achieved can solving this equation for the matrix \u0005, which contains the detector [34], P=F\u0005 (4) wherePrepresents the measured statistics and Fis the translation matrix between the basis of coherent and Fock states (photon number basis). The matrix \u0005is in the for phase-insensitive detectors, such as this MoSi single photon The diagonal elements of the matrix represent the response of the detector to states with different mean number of photons. These diagonal elements can of each Fock state in the response of the detector. The click probabilities per pulse pi, the detector.

We expect the resistance of the device to decrease rapidly after reaching a critical superconducting temperature Tc. In Figure 3.1, the superconducting behaviour of the nanodetector can be observed. The inset of the gure shows a short circuit used to monitor the resistance of our 150 nm wide detector. The resistance is measured using a 0:7\u0016Aprobe current while the cryostat is cooled down to base temperature, in order to obtain the resistance as a function be used later to obtain the critical current at 0 K for this detector. For NbN and other crystalline materials, the resistance from the crystalline structure the compound. In a grain boundary scattering models, electrons use thermal energy to hop over act trapping MoSi constriction, showing thatd\u001a(T) dT<0. The inset shows at the superconducting transition and a schematic picture of the short circuit to measure the resistance. 18Nevertheless, we nd material. this for the increase of resistance lowering the temperature is not satisfactory, not contain periodic grain boundaries. In- stead, we note with the Mooij empirical on resistivityd\u001a(T) by Mooij in 1973 [40]. One of these models is that of 'weak localization of the electrons'. In materials with high structural their lattice, quantum wavefunction of electrons decays strongly at large distances from the center of the wavepacket. All the relevant states (those near the Fermi energy EF) are localized, causing electrons to have very low mobility and making the material behave as an insulator. This is common in superconductivity as many super- conductors, including all the high Tcsuperconductors, a metal-insulator transition at very low temperatures. A rigorous analysis of phenomena is presented in Ref [41]. 3.1.2 I-V curves I-V curves are one of the main methods to characterize electronic devices. For supercon- ducting devices, one expects a nite amount of current to flow even when the voltage over the device is zero. It is important to note that our circuit is not designed as a pure voltage bias or current bias. Its goal is to restore the superconducting state in the nanowire after detecting resetting the detector. Consequently, the I-V curves here are not strictly standard I-V curves, widely used for the characterization of electric devices such diodes or junctions. Figure 3.2 shows an I-V curve for the 210 nm wide MoSi detector, at three different temperatures. Three distinct regimes can identied: i)The superconducting regime, ii) the breaking of superconductivity and iii) the normal state. We determine the critical cur- rentIcfrom the limits of the superconducting region, as a sharp transition in the measured current. When the temperature is increased, the superconducting region is reduced and the transition becomes smoother. Note that we are using a voltage source in series with a resis- tanceRbto feed current to the detector. Therefore, a vertical line indicating zero resistance will not appear for the superconducting state of the detector, due to this load resistance Rb. 19Figure 3.2: I-V curves of at different temperatures Figure 3.3: I-V curves of the 150 nm wide detector at two different temperatures. 20Between\u0006Icthe nanodetector is superconducting and presents zero resistance. An ohmic behaviour is observed which we can t to obtain a total resistance setup. According to the equivalent circuit for the nanodetector (See Figure 2.3), the switch is closed and the detector has no resistance RSC= 0. When the current reaches Ic, the wire relaxation oscillation regime, in the detector between the normal and superconducting state. The measured values in this region are not representative, as only a time average of these fluctuations is recorded. The fluctuations happen on the relaxation-oscillation regime for these detectors can be found in Ref.[28]. Lastly, when some parts of the detector have > Icwe observe linear behaviour with a resistance of the order of K s. If the current was further increased, all parts of the detector would we would get back R=RN+Rb. This would be the case of a horizontal line, with slope close to zero. For comparison, we show in Figure 3.3 the I-V curves obtained for the NbN nanodetector at two different temperatures. The curves shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 are very similar. NbN shows a bigger superconducting region, as this material has higher values for both critical current Icand critical temperature. Tc. In both materials, the breaking of superconductivity is less sharp when the temperature approaches its critical the their critical temperature Tc. 3.1.3 Critical current vs. temperature After recording many I-V curves at different temperatures, we extract from them values for the critical current and construct a relation between IcandT. The criteria for the critical current will be the start of the relaxation-oscillation regime. The last points in this graph have a bigger uncertainty associated, as nding In Figure the critical current with increasing temperatures is can be intuitively contributing to the breaking of superconductivity at lower currents. Then we t our values to the expression shown in the tting provides values for the critical temperature (with zero current applied) and critical current (at T = 0 K) of the detector. It is important to note thatIcwill determine the maximum bias current we can use to count photons, and consequently, the maximum pulse height of a detection event. When operating the detector at 3.85 K, the critical current is approximately 2:6\u0016A. Multiplying this current by the 50 resistor in the ampliers and the gain of the amplier chain, we obtain a pulse height of under 200 mV . This constitutes a problem as now the signal and the noise are comparable, 21Figure 3.4: Decrease of the critical current for increasing was made us- ing in the are also shown. and we cannot set a proper trigger voltage. This was experimentally found, as there were no signicant counts noise, at a low pass lter Detection of the nanowire So we have only characterized the material and conducting properties of the detector. Let's now look into the detection events (or counts) that the detector records. In SNSPD's, a detection event occurs when the arrival of one or more photons affects the superconducting state of the wire, driving it to the resistive state temporarily and creating a voltage pulse. To characterize the detector, we record its count rate, the current flowing through it and the optical power inciding on the detector. Before presenting the experimental results, let's outline the features of these that will not be experimentally probed. In this thesis, we will not consider the Local Detection Efciency [42] which is the prole of efciency 22of the nanowire along its width. In short, the edges of the detector are more sensitive to detecting photons, since they have a lower threshold current for photons for a xed energy. If we increase the bias current Ib, the efciency will increase polarization. the single photon detector light polarized parallel to the length of the wire, the count rate will be higher than for any other polarization. This dependence solving Maxwell's equations for the light inciding on the detector. Furthermore, we can play with the width of the nanowire to test this effect. Narrower wires will have a higher efciency overall (because more 'edge'), but a the efciency of the detectors[44]. It seems likely that any future application of this technology will be paired with a proper optical cavity, in order to obtain a better performance. 3.2.2 Counting photons In this section, we will study how the count rate of our detector changes when the bias current is modied. If the detector is biased close to its critical current Ib\u0019Ic, the energy of a single photon will be enough to break superconductivity and produce a count. In this situation, most pulses from the laser will second produced by the laser. This value is 20 MHz for our pulsed laser source. Conversely, as the bias current expect the count rate to decrease, given that now the device is further from the superconducting-to-normal transition and it may require more than one photon to trigger a detection. This multi-photon events are less probable, as the two photons must be absorbed very close in both space and time. As discussed earlier, the nanowire geometry of our detector improving in Section 3.1.2, once we bias the detector very close to its critical current Ic, we enter the relaxation-oscillation regime where we can no longer extract meaningful information the count rate. In fact, count rates higher than 20 MHz can recorded in this regime, in which the nanoconstriction oscillates between the normal and superconducting state. In total count rate the rate of dark counts and substract it from the total count rate. The voltage pulse created by a dark count is identical to that of a photon detection. Nevertheless, dark current, 6\u0016A. wavelength is 780 nm. KHz dark counts 3.6: Count rate of current, 22\u0016A. wavelength is 780 nm. current 1 KHz of dark counts 24counts. In literature, there's a dark due to thermally vortices crossing the 21, 45]. The vortices dissipates energy which breaks the superconducting shown signicantly if the temperature is increased or if a magnetic eld perpendicular to the wire is applied. [47]. In Figure 3.5 and 3.6, we show the count rate for our MoSi and NbN detectors when illuminated with 780 nm were performed base tempera- rate achieved in the MoSi nanodetector is 6 MHz, slightly lower than the count rate of the NbN nanodetector. The count rate of both single photon detectors is similar when increasing the bias current towards its critical value Ic. As the rate in the MoSi nanodetector is highest for currents near the critical current, as just one photon is enough to break superconductivity in this scenario. Dark counts are also higher when close to the critical current, they always remain signi- cantly lower than is much the lower critical temperature Tcin MoSi. This ( Tc= 3:35K) is closer to Tcfor this material, and the critical current is signicantly reduced (See Figure 3.4). As mentioned before in Section 3.1.3, the signal to noise ratio will limit the temperature at which the detector can detect relative counts also a different behaviour. The MoSi detector records 1 KHz of dark counts at a current very close to Ic, in contrast to NbN. This may suggest that MoSi has less dark counts overall, making it a prime candidate for quantum information applications. The dark count rate of NbN shows a clearer exponential growth for all counts for low bias currents to have a random statistical spread. These dark counts start growing exponentially from 4.7 \u0016Aonwards, possibly signaling a different cause to these dark counts at low currents. Lastly, we plot the counting rate the MoSi in a linear to previous results by M. Caloz et al [25], where an universal saturation of the rate is found for various photon SNSPD's maximum count rate will be by either the laser's repetition rate, or the reset time of the electrical circuit (set by the kinetic induc- tance). From the voltage pulse we estimated the reset time of our detector to be 150 ns, which would give a detector maximum count rate of 6.66 GHz, much bigger than MoSi detector current at 3.35 K. The used wavelength is \u0015= 780 nm. The count rate shows rst signs of saturation. Figure 3.8: Count rate of a MoSi critical current at T=0.75 K [25]. M. Caloz et al found universal saturation of the different wave- energies. 26In rst signs of saturation when approaching Ic. This result is not conclusive, as the experiment should be repeated for different wavelengths in order to possibly reproduce the results of Figure 3.8. It's unclear if this saturated count rate is feature of the material (MoSi being an amorphous superconductor) or the geometry of the detector (meander or nanodetector). This universal saturation has not been found for NbN nanodetectors studied in this experimental setup. Achieving a rate, closer to 20 MHz, is also desirable in order to compare these results to MoSi following raw data used for the tomographic anal- ysis of the detector. The count rate is recorded while varying the input pump power by attenuation of the laser beam. The bias current remains constant (we choose a point in the horizontal axis of Figure 3.5). The tuning of the power is achieved using the variable attenuator, formed by two crossed polarizers with a \u0015=2plate between them. The rotation of this half wave plate provides the whole range of optical power transmission. Hence, a set of points ( Ri;Pi) is bias current are shown and 3.10 for three different bias currents. Figure 3.9 shows the data on a log scale for the count rate, while Figure 3.10 is higher when we increase the bias current. For low transmission, the counts grow very fast for all currents. When approaching 100 % transmission, the counts stabilize at values for each bias current. bias currents. As demon- strated in Ref [48], if we this measurements in a double logarithmic equal would two photon events are dominant at this bias current. This is shown in Figure 3.10, where all bias current choices present linear behaviour with slope m= 1. from the critical current. These multi-photon events do appear in the crystalline NbN, but it is still a two-photon regime exists for this Tomography would unveil this regime and other features of the detector. For tomography purposes, it is desirable to have very low count rates for low powers and to approach saturation (20 MHz) when the transmission is 100 %. 27Figure 3.9: Counting rate of the detector as a function of optical input power for three different bias currents, on a logarithmic scale. The power is increased the our variable attenuator. 3.10: Double logarithmic scale plot of the count rate as a function of optical input power. There is a slope equal to one three Section 2.3, the count rate and the incident optical power are recorded.

There are elements the setup that can induce a loss of i.e. of laser light.It's detector separating the external To do so parameter to an absorption efciency. In this way, the response of the detector can be analyzedusing the number of photons that actually reach the detector and are absorbed by These are our candidates for 'light counts'. Using the size of the detector, the optical spot and a \u001825% absorption for the NbN lm, we have for these linear losses of \u0011= 10\u00005. At the time of elaborating this text, the tomographic tting had not been sucessful with the experimental data for MoSi. This constitutes the obvious next from a straight line, so it's possible to t multiple parameters, i.e. \u0011andp1. To illustrate the application of Tomography to a similar detector, 2 graphs from Ref. [26] are presented. These measurements were made on the 150 nm wide NbN nanodetector previously mentioned, which has a 5 nm thickness and an active area of 200x150 nm Figure 3.11 shows how the parameters piand\u0011change with bias current. As men- tioned before, at low currents, the energy of a photon may not be enough to break the superconducting state in the constriction. Therefore, through the nanowire, detections are now possible and is consistent our on the attenuation being different photon number regimes. The data corresponds to a low bias current point, where multi-photon events are expected to for different levels of optical power detector. This is illustrated 29Figure 3.11: graphs show the usefulness of Quantum Detector Tomography, as it can separate the various contributions and extract the parameters to characterize the detector in a single experimental run. 3.3.2 Improving tomography experiments At the initial stage of the research, there were some aspects of the experimental setup that limited the accuracy of implemented in the setup to improve its overall performance. Now, these two changes will be presented, along with the reasoning behind the modications. As mentioned in the optical setup, when rotating the half wave plate in our variable attenuator, we expect the power and the count rate to follow Malus' law. At an initial stage of research, measured count rate follow Malus' vibrations) noticeable because the spot size of the laser and the amplitude of the deviations were comparable. In other words, these fluctuations were moving the laser beam out of the active area of the detector, causing a drop in the count rate. Conversely, the power meter recorded a good Malus' law because its active area is much bigger than the laser spot size and the amplitude of the Therefore, these fluctuations were not signicant, as the laser spot was still on the active area of the power meter. In order to solve this, wa beam expander was removed from the setup. The purpose of this element was to enlarge the laser beam before the nal lens, so we had a smaller spot size when focusing on the detector, increasing the overall efciency. Removing the beam expander made the laser spot bigger, making the count rate less sensitive to these fluctuations. The tradeoff is a loss in efciency, as now more photons are hitting the detector outside of its active area. Figure 3.13 shows the count rate as a function of the angle of the \u0015=2plate at the initial state of the experiment (left) and after removing the beam expander (right). Another possible improvement of the experiment is to simultaneously monitor the power and the count rate. The beam splitter in our setup allows us to measure the power on the detector in real time, using a secondary ray directed towards a power meter. As stated before, knowing the transmission and reflection coefcients for this beam splitter allows to relate the optical power on the power meter and the optical power on the detector. In previous works using Quantum Detector Tomography [26, 37], the relationship between the of the \u0015=2plate and the optical power transmitted towards the detector had been taken at a time t0. On the other hand, the counting rate for was measured after removing the beam expander. The bigger spot size on the detector minimizes the effect of other fluctuations, and the data follows Malus' law for the improved setup. at a different time t1. The datasets used for tomography were of the form: [Ri(t1);P(t0)] (9) This constitutes a problem if the optical depends on time P=P(t), because we would be assuming power angle is the input optical power Making use of the beam splitter, we measure both variables at the same time and obtain complete data sets in one run. It's important to note that this is not an improvement by itself. This treatment will only enhance tomography if these two measured magnitudes are correlated: without correlation the data could be replaced by the time average. To verify the correlations we x the angle, bias current and temperature and let the detector count photons for several hours (14 hours). Figure 3.14 shows the cloud of points obtained. Applying the Pearson criteria, a moderate linear correlation is found between count rate and optical power, with a value of \u001a= 0:45. This implies that we can enhance the accuracy of tomography by introducing the complete data sets [Ri(t);Pi(t)], instead of the average [\u0016R;\u0016P]as the correlation contains extra information. 32Figure 3.14: Cloud of points for xed count rate vs. power. We nd a moderate linear correlation. These two changes in the experimental setup have been proven to help the consistency and accuracy the to will hopefully allow us to obtain better data sets and record reliable multi-photon events. This would help characterizing MoSi the underlying detection mechanism of these a key step towards designing and fabricating better detectors for future applications. 334. Conclusiones En este trabajo, hemos caracterizado un detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico de nanocable superconduc- tor, fabricado en MoSi. Hemos demostrado el car \u00b4acter superconductor del nanodetector, hallando una temperatura cr Tc= 4:98Ky una corriente cr \u00b4tica superconductora a 0 Kelvin de Ic(0) = 30:91\u0016A. Las curvas caracter \u00b4sticas I-V muestran un comportamiento similar al del NbN cristalino, aunque el nanodetector de MoSi posee un rango superconductor m \u00b4as peque no. En cuanto a su rendimiento detectando fotones, hemos estudiado su ritmo de cuentas en funci \u00b4on de la corriente que circula por el nanoca- ble, encontrando diferencias cualitativas con resultados anterior de Caloz et al. El m \u00b4aximo ritmo de cuentas obtenido fue de 6 MHz, por debajo del nivel de saturaci \u00b4on obtenido con el nanodetector de NbN (20 MHz). Obtener un mayor ritmo de cuentas es deseable a la hora de contrastar estos resultados, as \u00b4 como utilizar un rango amplio de longitudes de onda. La corriente cr \u00b4tica experimental a la temperatura base del sistema fue de Ic= 6\u0016Acon T= 3:35K. Hasta ahora, no se han registrado sucientes eventos de m \u00b4as de un fot \u00b4on, lo cual hace que no sea posible aplicar el m \u00b4etodo tomogr \u00b4aco al detector usando estos resultados. Se esperaba hallar un r \u00b4egimen donde los eventos multi-fot \u00b4on fueran dominantes al aplicar una corriente baja. M \u00b4as investigaci \u00b4on es necesaria en esta direcci \u00b4on, n de aplicar la Tomograf \u00b4a Cu \u00b4antica de Detectores y obtener la respuesta completa del nanodetector de MoSi. Por \u00b4ultimo, se presentan dos mejoras al montaje experimental. La exclusi \u00b4on de un expansor de haz hace que el sistema sea m \u00b4as robusto frente a fluctaciones (cambios de temperatura, vibraciones), a cambio de una p \u00b4erdida de eciencia. Por otra parte, la introducci \u00b4on de divisor de haz genera hasta dos rayos secundarios que utilizamos para obtener una imagen del detector y el l \u00b4aser en tiempo real, as \u00b4 como monitorizar la potencia \u00b4optica sobre el detector en todo momento. Se halla una correlaci \u00b4on linear entre el ritmo de cuentas y la potencia \u00b4optica, justicando que obtener datos simult \u00b4aneos de estas dos magnitudes mejora la precisi \u00b4on del proceso de ajuste tomogr \u00b4aco. Obtener una saturaci \u00b4on del ritmo de cuentas, as \u00b4 como identicar regiones donde los eventos de multi-fot \u00b4on sean dominantes, son los siguientes pasos en esta investigaci \u00b4on. Esto nos permitir \u00b4a aplicar \u00b4aca sobre superconductor de MoSi, obteniendo todos los par \u00b4ametros\u0011ypique caracterizan la re- spuesta del detector de fot \u00b4on\u00b4unico. Conclusions we studied We characterized the superconducting proper- ties of the 150 nm wide detector, which has a critical superconducting temperature of Tc= 4:98K. The obtained critical current at 0 Kelvin for this detector is Ic(0) = 30:91\u0016A. The measured I-V curves of the MoSi are to those of transition the normal state less sharp. For the count rate as a function of bias current, we with pre- vious results reported by Caloz et al, as an universal saturation of the count rate was not found. Still, it is desirable to achieve higher total count of wavelengths T= 3:35KwasIc= the maximum below the expected saturation at 20 MHz. The rate of dark counts appeared to be lower for Mosi for NbN, as presenting for low bias currents. events been making tomography in the MoSi expected, and further investigation is required to characterize the single photon detector. Lastly, two improvements were implemented in to of the tomographic observing events will piand\u0011and will characterize the intrinsic response of the detector, a key step in understanding the physycal process behind photon the measurements, limiting magnitude In this measure different magnitudes as power, temperature, of these measurements, in order to identify which is the main source of error in the setup, and to possibly improve the experiment and enhance the overall accuracy of the Temperature: The in temperature are reduced if the temperature (3.35 K): uncertainty in temperature. This data was taken over a hour long measurement, proving that our cryostat and cooling system stable time. Bias Current: uncertainty in bias current arises precision of the voltage source (Yokogawa). Operating this device in the proper range, we have an experimental uncertainty of 10\u00005mV corresponding to the last digit we can read off this voltage source. We will treat this uncertainty as fluctuations in current (noise) and ignore the uncertainty in the value of the 100 resistor. Therefore, our uncertainty in the bias current through Ib= 15\u0016A\u000610\u00002\u0016A (11) In the cryostat, there's a temperature gradient between the outside environment and the heat shields (3 K and 50 K shields). This introduces a thermal voltage offset, that is considered to be constant for small temperature changes. All our experiments were done in the 3-10 K temperature range. We nd this value of thermal voltage offset by looking at the I-V curves and their asimmetry around the point (0,0). The experimental value for this offset isVoffset = 1:21mV. Optical Power: This laser (and every non-ideal light source) presents some fluctuations in the intensity of the light. We measure this in the statistics mode of our power meter for a moderate power level and a long timescale (14 hours). We expect the power fluctuations to have a gaussian spread around a mean power, as predicted by the theory of coherent states in quantum optics. The shot noise, i.e. minimum standard deviation attainable, is byp photons pulse corresponding to 5.1: fluctuations in our power meter, showing a gaussian distribution. Data was taken over 14 hours we obtain a shot noise of \u001bSN= 14.3 nW. The The relative fluctuations in power were found to be around 0.7 % of the power. Count Rate: The photon counting process is also of statistical nature. Every time a photon is absorbed by the detector, we can 'roll a dice' to determine if it is detected or not. This process is repeated times per second, where is the repetition rate of the laser. Therefore, the count rate can be modelled as a binomial counting process. We obtain the error in the count rate xating the angle (therefore xating the mean power) and recording the count rate for 10 seconds in each point. In this way we nd a relation between the standard deviation in count rate versus bias current shown in Figure 5.2. We can also compute the standard deviation of the count rate each grated over 10 seconds for each point. Graph provided by E. Abeln. Instead of a binomial statistical spread, we nd a linear increase in the error that is proportional to the count rate. For a binomial process, the uncertainty should decrease for count rates. that increases as we reach higher count rates. This will be helpful to model the error when adding noise to the tomographic code. CR= 6MHz\u000630KHz = 6MHz\u00060:5 % (14) deviation by the count rate value), has a constant value around 0.5 % of the count rate. This will help us modelling the error in the count rate, when testing the robustness of our Tomography code. 39Model selection in tomography The procedure can be really demanding when working with a non-ideal detector, so we will use a modied technique introducing to making the much and \"cheaper\" some assumptions to ease the tting of our data. We will assume that above a certain index that dark counts are not regarded as 0-photon events. This can be justied by the fact that the dark count rate is independent of the laser repetition rate , and therefore it can a probability per pulse. This QDT method does not make any assumption on how the detector works, but still characterizes its response completely. We will use Equation 2.8 for computing the click probabilty of our detector. This protocol is a modication of the tomographic procedures designed t parameters needed for systems with low efciency, i.e. a small value of \u0011. Here, we outline how we compute the what we mean by an regime . First, we count rate Diduring tseconds as a function of the optical power Pi. From this data, we also get the standard deviation of both these magnitudes \u001bD;iand\u001bR;i. Next, we compute the click probability riby subtracting counts normalized modulus of the standard devia- tions of both the and the For a random process that is used to collect all counts. As a nal step, we convert our optical power data Pito mean number in use, his Planck's constant and cis the speed of light For the tomography, we evaluate the t of Equation 2.1 and the goodness of the t by evaluation the minimum value of one, while pK+1;pK+2;:::are K indicates which of the probabilities pk=p1;p2;p3;:::;1are going to have a contribution in the detection events, and which will be set to one (see Section 2.3) To t our data At the same time we want to make sure we are not overtting. In theory, by increasing K, we will always reduce 2(K)at the cost of introducing parameters that may be physically irrelevant. To avoid this issue, we apply model selection Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) that penalizes the 2(K)values depending 2(K) = (K+ 1)\u00002jln 2(K) m is the number of t parameters (K+1 in our case) and j is the number of data points (of the shape ( Ni,ri)). Instead minimizing nd choice for K and the value of 2(K)for that model. It is worth noting that this information criteria only compares the relative goodness of the models, it does not reveal if we are comparing good or bad models for our data. 41The effect of noise on the process different errors not straightforward. We test the stability of the procedure, by introducing noise in the count rate. The uncertainty in the optical power will only rescale the power axis, but it does not affect the tomography code. Therefore, an error in the count rate is introduced, based on the experimental results of the noise, we follow the result from Figure 5.2 and add a linear error to the values Riin the dummy data. This function is shown in Figure 5.3, where ris a random number drawn from a normal distribution. Then, this modied data is introduced in the tomography code and we hope to nd back the p1previously set. This tomography code the will always be successful so we choose the guess for p1to be a random number rbetween zero and one. Compared to experimental data, the test data we created has the advantage of knowing the correct value for all pibeforehand, so we can quantify the of Figure 5.3: values of p1versus the set values in the test data. The chosen linear error corresponds to 1% of the total count rate, two times the relative error found on Figure 5.2. This shows demonstrates the tomography tting routine and the model selection are robust for the level of uncertainty present in the experimental results. 43Acknowledgments I would like to thank the University of Leiden and the Quantum Optics group for receiving me and helping me develop my scientic skills.
