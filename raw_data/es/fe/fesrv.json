It is an organic Arsenic compound which is used as a herbicide and medication in animals. Reasons for Citation f Sodium Cacodylate is on the Right to Know Hazardous Substance because it is cited by OSHA, DOT, DEP, IARC and EPA. f This chemical is on the Special Health Hazard Substance List. SEE GLOSSARY ON PAGE 5. FIRST AID Eye Contact f Immediately flush with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes, lifting upper and lower lids. Remove contact lenses, if worn, while flushing. water. Inhalation f Remove the stopped if heart action has stopped. f Transfer promptly to NFPA HEALTH 4 - FLAMMABILITY REACTIVITY 0 - CARCINOGEN POISONOUS by passing through the skin. f Sodium Cacodylate is a CARCINOGEN. HANDLE WITH EXTREME CAUTION. f Skin contact can cause irritation, burns, rash, and loss of pigment. f Eye contact can cause irritation and burns. f Inhaling Sodium Cacodylate can irritate the nose and throat and an ulcer or hole in the \"bone\" (septum) dividing the headache, and even death. f Sodium Cacodylate may damage the nervous system Sodium Cacodylate CARCINOGEN in humans. There may be no safe level of exposure to a carcinogen, so all contact should be reduced the lowest possible level. f The above exposure limit is for air levels only. When skin contact also occurs, you may be Determining Your Exposure f Read the product manufacturer's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and the label to determine product ingredients and important safety and health information about the product mixture. f For each individual hazardous ingredient, read the Department Sheet, available your facility's RTK Central File or Hazard Communication Standard file. f You have a right to this information under the New Jersey Worker and Community Right to Know Act, the Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health (PEOSH) Act if you are a public worker in New Jersey, and under the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) if you are a private worker. f The New Jersey Right to Know Act requires most employers to label chemicals in the workplace and public to provide their employees with information concerning chemical hazards and controls. The federal OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) (N.J.A.C. 12:100-7) require to employees. This Fact Sheet is a summary of available information the that may from exposure. Duration of other to any the Sodium : f Skin contact can cause irritation, burns, itching, rash, and loss of pigment. f Eye contact can cause irritation, burns, and red, watery eyes. f exposure to Cacodylate and can f Sodium Cacodylate is a There is evidence that Arsenic and Arsenic compounds cause skin and lung cancer in humans. f Many scientists believe there is no safe level of exposure to a carcinogen Reproductive Hazard f There is limited evidence that Sodium Cacodylate is a teratogen in animals. Until further testing has been done, it should be treated a possible teratogen in humans. Other skin contact can cause thickened skin and/or patchy areas of darkening and loss of pigment. Some persons may develop white lines on the nails. f Long-term exposure can cause an ulcer or hole in (septum) dividing hoarseness and sore Sodium Cacodylate may damage the liver. Medical Medical Testing Before beginning employment and at regular times thereafter, (at least annually), the following are recommended: f Exam of the skin and nails f Test for urine Arsenic . This is most accurate at the end workday. Eating shellfish or fish may elevate Arsenic these tests and an nervous system and liver evaluation include a history of past and present symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for damage already done are not a substitute for controlling exposure. Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal right to this information under t he OSHA Access to Employee Exposure and Medical Records Standard (29 CFR 1910.1020). Mixed Exposures f More than light alcohol consumption can cause liver damage. Drinking changes, such as thickening and pigment changes, make those more likely to develop skin cancer.

For further information on workplace controls, consult the containers. f Provide employees with hazard information and training. f Monitor airborne chemical concentrations. f Use Wash or shower if skin comes in contact with a hazardous material. f Always wash at the end of the workshift. f Change into clean clothing if clothing becomes contaminated. f Do not take contaminated clothing home. f Get special training to wash contaminated clothing. f Do not eat, smoke, or drink in areas where chemicals are being may be useful or required: f Use a Class I, Type B, biological safety hood when mixing, handling, or preparing Sodium f Use method to reduce dust during clean- up. DO NOT DRY SWEEP. f Use a high efficiency particul ate air (HEPA) filter when vacuuming. Do not use a standard shop vacuum. Personal Protective Equipment The OSHA Personal Protective Equipment Standard (29 CFR 1910.132) requires employers to determine the appropriate personal protective equipment for each hazard and to train employees on how and when to use protective equipment. The following recommendations are only guidelines and may apply to every situation. Gloves . Wear personal protective equipment made from material that can not be permeated or degraded by this substance. Safety equipment suppliers recommendations on the most protective glove and clothing material for your operation. f Safety equipment manufacturers recommend Nitrile and Natural Rubber for gloves and DuPont Tyvek\u00ae, or the equivalent, as before work. Eye Protection f Wear eye protection with side shields or goggles. f Wear a face shield along with goggles when working highly empl oyer conditions, for training, respirator as described in the OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134). f For field applications check with your supervisor and your safety equipment supplier regarding the appropriate respiratory equipment. f Where the for mg/m3 (as and filters for radon daughters, ha ve been replaced with the N, R, and P series. Each series has three levels of filtering efficiency: 95%, 99%, and 99.9%. f Where for exposure operated or other positive-pressure mode. Fo r increased protection Fire Hazards If employees are expected to fight fires, they must be trained and equipped as stated in the OSHA Fire Brigades Standard (29 CFR 1910.156). f Sodium Cacodylate may burn, but does not readily ignite. f Use dry chemical, CO 2, water spray or foam as extinguishing agents. f POISONOUS and Arsenic fumes keep fire -exposed containers cool.

A carcinogen is a substance Chemical Abstracts Servic e, to a specific chemical. CFR is the Code of Federal Regulations, which are the regulations of the United States government. A combustible substance is a solid, liquid or gas that will burn. A corrosive substance is a gas, liqui d or solid that causes destruction of human skin or severe corrosion of containers. DEP is the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. DOT is the Department of Transpo rtation, the federal agency that regulates the transpo rtation of chemicals. EPA is the federal agency ERG is the animal. A flammable substance is a solid, liquid, vapor or gas that will ignite easily and burn rapidly. The flash point is the temperature at which a liquid or solid gives off vapor that can form a flammable mixture with air. IARC is the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a scientific group. Ionization Potential is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or molecule. It is measured in electron volts. IRIS is the Integrated Risk Information System database maintained by federal EPA. The database contains information on human health effects that may result from exposure to various chemicals in the environment. Lower Explosive Limit , is the lowest concentration of a combustible substance (gas or vapor) in air capable of continuing an explosion. mg/m3 means milligrams of a chemical in a cubic meter of air. It is a measure of concentration (weight/volume). A mutagen is a substance that causes mutations. A mutation is a change in the genetic material in a body cell. Mutations can lead to birth defects, miscarriages, or It classifies substances according to their fire and explosion hazard. NIOSH is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. It tests equipment, evaluates NTP is the National Toxicology Program which tests chemicals and reviews evidence for cancer. OSHA is the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which adopts and enforces health and safety standards. PEOSHA is the New Jersey Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act, which adopts and enforces health and safety standards in public workplaces. Permeated is the movement of chemicals through protective materials. PIH is a DOT which Poison Inhalation Hazards. ppm means parts of a substance per million parts of air. It is a measure of concentration by volume in air. A reactive substance is a solid, liquid or gas that releases certain conditions. STEL is a Short a 15- minute exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a work day. A teratogen is a substance that causes birth is the highest concentration in air above which there is too much fuel (gas or vapor) to begin a reaction or explosion. Vapor Density is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of one gas to the weight of another (usually Hydrogen ), at the same temperature and pressure. The vapor pressure is a measure of how readily a liquid or a solid mixes with air at its surface. A higher vapor pressure indicates a higher concentration garlic odor HAZARD DATA Hazard Rating Firefighting Reactivity 4 - Health 0 - Fire 0 - Reactivity DOT#: UN 1688 ERG Guide #: 152 Hazard Class: 6.1 (Poison) Sodium Cacodylate may burn, but does not readily ignite.
