Background: Because dental eruption is the result of a series of physiological events, it is important to acknowledge precisely the of establish diagnostic, preventive and treatment criteria. The aim of this to compare the cross-sectional and cohort methods toward estimating The study sample was comprised of 524 school-age children from the State of Mexico (273 females and 251 males). Only permanent teeth were surveyed: the first upper molar and central and lateral incisors and the first lower molar. The cohort was observed during a 3-year period until the tooth method both methods, teeth budded first in females. The average ages of dental eruption according to both methods did not show statistical difference in 88% of the teeth. Conclusions: Measurement Introduction Dental eruption is the result of a series of physiological events influenced by genetic and cultural factors. To have more precise knowledge of the average age of exfoliation and eruption of every tooth prevention and treatment.1 Logan and Kronfeld,2 in 1933, published the stages of development and dental eruption, information that has been subsequently cited by authors such ages dental eruption. Various studies have been developed to calculate the average age of dental eruption, most of them being cross-sectional, with the purpose of identifying the corresponding dental pattern of eruption. An example is the work published by Hurme9 (1949), which generated statistical tables on the chronology of dental eruption and defined standards for children from the temperate zone in the northern part of the U.S. Establishing age a heterogeneous sample at a time in which each individual is at a different eruptive phase. The phase lasts from 3 months to 1 year 3 months, so it is not possible to observe an exact age of dental eruption.10,11 Some studies have shown that it is not the of local factors and systemic conditions present in the social environment of each individual produce certain differences.12-15 However, of studies is from the of tooth eruption in these studies showed an average of 4.25 years, with differences in gender and type of tooth.11,16 Longitudinal studies that have been carried out to determine the age of dental eruption are few because its development requires much time and expense. Examples of these studies are those of Savara and Steen17 and Yamaguchi and Holman18 who carried out a 20-year follow-up to identify the average age and sequence of eruption in a northern European and which are conducted countries whose environmental characteristics are different from the various population groups that make up our country. The dental diagnosis and treatment related with the age of tooth eruption the foregoing, it age of tooth eruption obtained through cross-sectional studies is not very precise. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the average age of tooth eruption calculated both measurements. 2. Methods The study population was comprised of 524 children (273 females and 251 males) with ages from 5 years 0 months to 9 years 0 months, enrolled in the third grade at the pre-school level and from first to third grade at the primary school level in the neighborhoods of Ciudad Nezahualc\u00f3yotl and Chimalhuac\u00e1n, State of Mexico. A sample was obtained for convenience and the size was calculated based on the longitudinal study, integrating children from 5 to 6 years of age in an interval that would comprise all the whose parents did not consent for their children to take part in the study, those with palate malformation and those who had dental orthotics. Those children who were not seen for two consecutive sessions were eliminated from the study. Longitudinal and cross-sectional methods were identify the median eruption: first molar and central incisor of the maxilla and lateral incisor and first molar of the mandible. For the longitudinal method a monthly review was carried out for 3 years in those individuals who did not have the specific tooth to observe, and the age of the child was recorded at the time of the tooth eruption of the four types of teeth. For the cross-sectional method, only one examination was done, in only one stage, at the middle of the school cycle of the second year of follow-up in the same sample cohort. The criteria for choosing this time for measurement in the cross-sectional method was to give an opportunity for the tooth eruption in children who at the beginning of the study did not have any permanent teeth. An intra- and interobserver respectively. inspection using a wooden tongue depressor, a dental mirror and natural light using the standardized criteria of recording the tooth present when at least one of the cusps or incisor border of the crown of the tooth has come through the gingival epithelium.1,3,5,9,10 The data for each student (name, date of birth, gender, group, school and date of mouth examination) were recorded in an epidemiological file. The parent guardian signed informed consent. Student t test was applied with a 95% CI to compare the average ages of the tooth eruption of each type of tooth in the female group with relationship to the male group in each of the study methods and to compare the average ages of the female and male groups between the cross-sectional and longitudinal methods. Student t test was used to analyze if there were differences in the average ages of eruption between the teeth from the left and right sides. v.10.0 was used for statistical analyses. 3. Results Because there were no differences between the right and left side for the average ages of tooth eruption observed, a total of eight types of teeth were classified, four for females and four for males. Presentation of the results began with the description for the cross-sectional method and subsequently with the longitudinal method. Finally, a comparison was made between both methods where a greater homogeneity in the data obtained with the longitudinal method was able to be seen. 3.1. Cross-sectional method The average age of tooth eruption was obtained through the cross-sectional method. It was observed that it is earlier in the female group in three of the four types of teeth studied, with the exception of the lower central incisor ( Table 1). The differences were from 5 months for the lower first molar to 10 months for the lower central incisor. In this group, the tooth that erupted first was the lower first molar (6 years 1 month) and the last was the lower central incisor. In males, tooth eruption began with the lower central incisor (6 years 4 months) and ended with the lower lateral incisor (7 years 2 months). Student t test was applied to compare the average ages of tooth eruption between groups and statistically significant differences were seen in three types of shows ranges were calculated adding and subtracting the average one time from the standard deviation. These estimates were done with a probability of error <0.05 (p<0.05). The ranges varied from 10 months for the first lower molar to 1 year 5 months for the lower lateral incisor, taking into consideration from the first child to the last child in whom the same tooth erupted. The amplitude of the ranges of tooth eruption was similar in both genders except for the lower lateral incisor, which was higher by 4 months in of tooth method The average age eruption was obtained through the longitudinal method (Table 2). Similar values were obtained between genders with the exception of the lower lateral incisor whose eruption was earlier in females (6 years 3 months) compared with the male group where it erupted 7 with this method began with the lower central incisor in both groups at the age of 5 years 11 months and ended with the lower lateral incisor at 6 years 10 months in males. Figure 2 shows the ranges of permanent tooth eruption. The amplitude of the ranges is similar in both genders except for the lower lateral incisor which, in females, has a range of 9 months and in males, 6 months, with a difference of 3 months. The first lower molar was the tooth that had the shortest range (4 months) and the lateral lower range females of methods Comparison of the average age of eruption of the eight types of teeth observed between the cross-sectional and longitudinal methods was carried out with the Student t test. Table 3 shows no statistically significant differences in 88% females was a significant difference seen in the lower central incisor where the longitudinal method reported a tooth eruption year 4 than the cross-sectional method. For males, the comparison of the average age of eruption between methods did not show any statistically significant any of the teeth studied. obtained with the longitudinal method were more homogeneous. This was able to be seen in the standard deviation of the averages, which showed variability of 3 to 4 months for the longitudinal method and 5 to 8 months the cross-sectional with the method were greater, up to 1 year 2 months for the lower lateral incisor compared with the longitudinal method, whose range of greater was 8 months for the same tooth. 4. Discussion In general, for the two study methods, an earlier age of tooth eruption was observed in females compared to the reports by Kutesa et al.19 in Uganda, Hurme9 in a North American population, Romo et al.20 in M\u00e9xico, Mora et al.13 and Morgado-Seraf\u00edn and Garc\u00eda-Herrera15 in Cuba, Plasencia et al.21 between three types of teeth. In some prior studies performed in a population of Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, State earlier tooth eruption was noted in females.12,20,23 Although there is that explains this sexual dimorphism, it should be mentioned that it has been attributed to the so-called growth peaks first occurring in females and the hormone on in foreign studies such as the average age of the eruption of the upper first molar, which was 6 years 5 months, similar to what was reported by Savara and Steen17 in a U.S. childhood population, the lower first molar with an average age of eruption of 6 years 1 month as reported by Eskeli et al.24 in Finland and Plasencia et al.21 in Spain, the upper lateral incisor with an average age of 7 years 1 month, the same as reported by Parner et al.25 in Denmark. With regard to the male gender, similarities with the literature were with the first lower molar with an average age of eruption of 6 years 5 months, as studied by Savara and Steen17 and the lower lateral incisor with an average age of 7 years 1 month, similar to what was reported by San Miguel-Pent\u00f3n et al.26 in Cuba. The average age of eruption of the lower central incisor, from 6 years 3 months, coincides with what was reported Plasencia et al.21 in Spain. The average ages of eruption obtained using the previously observed in a Mexican population. In the neighborhoods of Aurora and Benito Juarez in Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, State of Mexico, it was observed that in general the average ages of tooth eruption were greater than in the present study except for the lower central incisor in females and lower lateral incisor in males, with a difference of 7 months.20 The results obtained through the longitudinal method showed statistical significance between genders only in the average age of eruption of the lower lateral incisor. Slight differences were observed, from 1 to 5 months, compared with what was published by Savara and Steen,17 except in the average age of eruption of the lower central incisor of females, which was 1 year lower in the present study. For the eight different teeth studied (four for females and four for males), the average ages of tooth eruption obtained with the longitudinal observational method were a slightly earlier in relation to the average ages obtained with the cross-sectional were no significant difference for the lower central incisor for females. Age of eruption of the first inferior molar in females was recorded at 6 years 1 month with both methods of measurement. Given the accuracy observations that the ranges obtained would be greater than those the longitudinal was confirmed because extent of the ranges obtained by the cross-sectional method was up to 1 year 2 months in comparison with the longitudinal method, whose months. eruption contribution to this line of purpose is to study the profiles of tooth eruption in the Mexican population. It was observed that, with the longitudinal method, high precision in the measurements is obtained because one can more observe the tooth bud, whereas with the cross-sectional the observation, phase. The results of this study more accurate than cross-sectional method, it requires expensive. The results showed sufficient evidence to establish that of of tooth obtained with cross-sectional observation method obtained longitudinal method. Taking into consideration the likely influence of local factors in the social environment, it is considered convenient to give continuity to the line of research with the intention of expanding the sample and verifying the relevance tables of the average age of tooth eruption for the Mexican population in general or, if it is of greater benefit, to develop tables according to region or to the local level.
