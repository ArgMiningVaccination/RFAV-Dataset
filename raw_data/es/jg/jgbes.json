Urban, Page 4/44 1. Introduction The o bjective of this report is to a ssess the preclinical and clinical available data on Centella asiatica Urban, as well information to prepare the Community monograph on the plant and its preparations. This report is based on the documentation provided by the European Medic ines Agency (EMA) completed by from international literature. Bibliog raphic PubMed or combinations thereof is a perennial herb belonging to the plant family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) (see Table 1), which contains 20 different species. is a slender, creeping plant, rooting at the nodes, growing in the damp areas in different tropical countries. Apart from this name, which is usually employed in scientific work, the synonym Hydrocotyle asiatica L. is the designation most commonly found. In German, the medicinal plant is als o known by the name Luei Gong Gen (Chinese), Blasteostimulina (asiaticoside) (Spanish). volatile Centella of Centella Brinkhaus pseudosaponins) madecassic three asiaticosides, asiaticoside A and asiaticoside B (Fig. 1 - Brinkhaus et al. 2000). The structures of the three triterpenoid asiaticoside, - urs-12-ene-28-oic acid and of 2 ,3,6,23-tetrahydroxyolean - 12-ene-28-oic acid (Sahu et al. 1989). The main active principles of Centella asiatica, are the triterpenoids European Significant active constituent have been of Centella asiatica different countries (Randriamampionona et al. 2007) . Depending on the source of the material, the amount of the triterpenoids may vary widely from 1 % to 8% (ESCOP 2009). Fig. 1 (from Brinkhaus et al. asiatica in respectable amount (Asakawa et al. rich in carotenoids, vitamins B and C (Tiwari et al. 2000). Recently, two new flavonoids as 1 291177/2009 Page 7/44 a known compound, isochlorogenic acid 3, were isolated from the whole plant of Centella asiatica (Subban et al. 2008). The flavonoids Centella asiatica, arabinogalactan (AG), contain a little -(14)-linked Gal pA and -(12)-linked Rha p residues (Wang et al. 2004). Herbal aqueous extracts: TECA, TTFCA and TTF, a ll containing 40% of asiaticoside and 60% of the agly cons (asiatic acid and madecassic acid ). In particular clinical studies published describing the use of the following preparations: TTFCA, TECA and, where the name of the is mentioned, Madecassol\u00ae and in literature are reported to contain 30% of asiatic acid and 30% of madecassic acid, while the extract TTF is reported to comprise 60% of asiatic acid and madecassic acid in a ratio that is not clearly defined. In all extracts the remaining 40% is purified asiaticoside (Brinkhaus et al. 2000). Information coming from literature and licensed medicinal prod ucts confirms that all as ETCA asiaticoside and 60% of asi atic acid and madecassic acid. TECA is a highly fractioned ester fractions to reach about the 40% of asiaticoside and about the 60% of the triterpenic genins: asiatic acid and madecassic acid. The extreme and involve chemical treatments that remove the herbal matrix . The extract is a recombination of a highly refined extract with an isolated constituent and the natural of the components is not m aintained. Therefore, based on the information on manufacturing process, the HMPC is of the opinion that TECA extract cannot be classified as an herbal preparation due to the manufacturing steps and composition. Insufficient information about the quality of other herbal preparation historically in medicinal use Combinations of EMA/HMPC/ 291177/2009 Page 8/44 1.2.

Assessment report assessment assessment report reviews the scientific literature data available for Centella asiatica and from the WHO monograph, monograph, from PubMed, from the European Medicines Agenc y (EMA) library, the Internet, information taken from international literature as well as available information data on medicinal use Centella asiatica (L.) is an e thnomedical plant used in different continents by diverse ancient cultures and tribal groups. The plant is native in countries like Sri Lanka, Madagascar, South Africa and Malaysia. Centella asiatica has been referred to in the ancient traditional Chinese Shennong Herbal about 2,000 years ago and in Indian Ayurvedic medicine about 3,000 years ago . The Chinese prescribed the leaves in curing leucorrhoea and toxic fever while in India, this plant is used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, usually described under the plant was also used to treat leprosy (Sahu et this commonly eaten especially among and eczema (Goh et al.1995; Abdul Hamid et al. 2002). Fresh extracts of this plant have been used by the people of Java and the Malay Peninsula for many years, as both topical and internal agents, for healing of wounds for the cognitive retard (Kartnig, 1988). (asiatic 2004) and antiproliferative effect (Yoshida et al. 2005; Randriamampionona et al. 2007). In folk medicine different uses, not supported by experimental or clinical treat ment of keloids (Hausen et 1993) but there are not sufficient clinical data confirming their efficacy in this indication.

Information on period of medicinal use in the Community Centella asiatica has been referred in the French Pharmacopoeia ed. 1884. Despite its long history of traditional use, Centella appeared in the Codex in 1884 and the first dry extract was not created until 1941. Three years after its triterpenoid molecules were isolated by the French scientist, P. Boiteau. The British Herbal P harmacopoeia reports the systemic use of the aerial in rheumatic condition 1983 ). External use TECA has a long history of use in Europe as wound healing drug. for cutaneous use (powder, cream and ointment) since 1968. Active constituen ts of Centella asiatica are components of many cosmetic preparations worldwide in the area of skin care. The leaves of Centella asiatica found application in clinical practice for dermatological disorders and in particular for improving wound, burns, skin and use Medicinal Madecassol\u00ae in tablets for oral use are authorised in Europe since 1969 (BE).

The water extract application of 50% ethanol in the gastric ex vivo chamber model Koo In study, the healing of Centella extract prepared from Centella asiatica dry plant and the concentration of asiaticoside in the water extract was quantitatively determined with the use of high performance liquid chromatography analysis. For the preparation of water extract, 30 g of Centella asiatica was boiled in 600 ml of distilled water under reflux for one hour. The solution was then filtered and freeze- dried to obtain the powder, which water before . rats with kissing ulcers. They were found to reduce the size of the ulcers at day 3 and 7 in a dose -dependent manner, with hand promoted. The expression of basic fibroblast growth factor, an important factor, in rats CE asiaticosid were observed after 0.25 g/kg 10 mg/kg asiaticoside administration, suggesting that asiaticoside may be the most active Centella asiatica extract that enhanced Different doses of aqueous extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) of the whole plant of Centella asiatica have been show n to counter -attack extract, powder of the plant was extracted with eight parts of water under boiling for 5 hours and filtered to collect the extract coarse of plant was extracted with five parts of methanol at 60 -65\u00b0C for report asiatica (L.)

Behavioural (open field, dark/bright arena, hole board and radial arm young adult mice was significantly improved in radial arm maze and hole board tests. Treatment resulted in increased both month and 6 promote brain function of juvenile and young adult mice (Rao et al. 2005) . Assessment report on of a study was to determine the possible influence on the primary brain were to determine the Centella asiatica (gotu stimulated GAD activity by over 40% at a dose of valproic acid on this inhibitory tra nsmitter in the central nervous system was inhibited following herb has been in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries as a nerve tonic. has neurite outgrowth in human SH - SY5Y cells in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). A water extract of Centella was ineffective at 100 Sub fractions Centella for neurite elongation in the presence of NGF. High est activity was found with a non marked activity at 1 present in GKF10 to GKF13, further indicating that other active components kg ed axonal during the rat growth spurt period of Centella asiatica fresh leaf extract treatment on the dendritic morphology of hippocampal CA3 neurons, of the regions of the brain concerned wi th learning and memory, was investigated. Fresh leaf juice was extracted from these leaves after washing, air -drying and homogeni sing in a glass vessel and finally filtering through a sterile gauge cloth. Neonatal rat pups (7 days old) were fed with 2, 4 o r 6 ml /kg body weight of fresh leaf extract of Centella asiatica for 2, 4 or 6 weeks. The results showed branching along the both apical and basal dendrites in rats treated with 4 and 6 ml /kg body weight per day of Centella asiatica for longer periods of time (i.e. 4 and 6 weeks). The authors concluded that the constituents/active principles present in Centella asiatica extract neuronal dendritic growth stress and neurodegenerative and disorders (Mohandas Rao et al. 2006) . The role of Centella asiatica fresh leaf one of concerned with learning and memory, in adult rats, has been investigated. Rats (2.5 months old) were fed with 2, 4 and 6 ml /kg body weight of fresh leaf juice extract of Centella asiatica for 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. The fresh leaf juice was fed to the rats such, through a branching along the both apical and basal dendrites in rats treated with 6 m l/kg body weight/day Centella asiatica for 6 weeks. However, the rats treated with 2 and 4 ml/kg body weight/day for 2 and 4 weeks did not show any significant change in hippocampal CA3 neuronal dendritic Centella has neuronal dendritic growth s timulating properties.

A cyclic AMP response element a neuroblastoma cell line expressing amyloid beta 1 -42 (A) and embryonic extract of Centella asiatica developed also an antiviral action against type II Herpes simplex virus. Centella asiatica, has been used in India in leprosy patients. considered acts indigenously produced dry of Centella asiatica on the acid -fastness and viability of M. tuberculosis was investigated showing that Centella asiatica may not have any direct action on the acid -fastness or viability of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vitro. For this study Centella asiatica stock solution was prepared by weighing 60 mg of the powder of Centella asiatica and dissolving it in 3 ml of M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (Herbert et al. 1994) . a ntibacterial activity of an ethanolic Centella asiatica extract at concentrations of 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/ml against a battery of enteric pathogens was studied. The inhibitory effect of the demonstrated at a concentration of 400 mg/ml. The results of this study indicate the antimicrobial activity Centella asiatica against as against bacteria strains was assessed by the presence or absence of inhibition the phagocytic index and total WBC count. The F ratio of the phagocytic index significant the carboxyl and important roles in the expression of immunological activity (Wang et al. 2005). Assessment report Centella asiatica (L.)

Effects of the fresh plant water extra ct of Centella investigated. The yield of water extract plant was 2.5%. Treatment with the extract significantly decreased the number of larger ACF (with four or more crypts per focus) in the large intestine in the early stage, while the number of methylated DNA adducts was not decreased compared with that in the AOM -initiation stage, the extract decreased the total the number of larger ACF, accompanied by a decrease in the 5- bromo -20- deoxyuridinelabeling index and an increase in the induction of apoptotic cells in the colonic mucosa. The incidences of neoplasms , the numbers of in intestines intestines, in rats given AOM alone (p < 0.05). The extra ct at a dose of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the multiplicity of neoplasms in the small intestine (p < 0.05). These results suggest that inhibition of formation of AOM extract is with cell proliferation and of apoptosis in on colon tumorigenesis (Bunpo et al.

In the elevated plus -maze test, diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg) or asiaticoside (5 or 10 mg/kg) increased the percentage of entries into open arms and of time spent on open arms. In the light/dark test, as with 1 mg/kg diazepam, asiaticoside (10 and 20 mg/kg) increased the time spent in the light area and the movement in the light area without altering the total locomotor activity of the animals. In the hole - board test, asiaticoside at 10 mg/kg significantly increased head -dipping counts an -like 2006). A study assessed the effects of Gotu Kola plant 5 and 10 mg/kg body w eight). Various paradigms were used to assess activity, drinking that Gotu Kola, its (Wijeveera et al. 2006) . been shown to induce type I collagen level, remains only partially understood. The conclusions of a study conducted dermal fibrobl ast cells suggest that can induce type I collagen synthesis the T R1 kinase -independent Smad pathway (Lee et al. 2006). The application of asiaticoside at low doses of 108 to 1012% levels of cytokines produced at the site of the burn wound was examined. The topical application of a low dose (10 pg, 1 ng, levels (10 to 100 ng/ml) enhanced MCP -1 production in HaCaT cells, but it had no direct effect on VEGF production. Furthermore, asiaticoside (10 pg to 100 increased IL -1 production in THP -1 macrophages with MCP -1, but it had no effect on IL-1 production without MCP -1 or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Findings suggest that the enhancement of burn wound healing by might be during wound repair as caused by in MCP-1 in macrophages induced cooperatively by asiaticoside plus MCP -1 et 2008) .

The authors hypothesis ed that could be two triterpenoid glycosides madecassoside and extracts as a topical anti -psoriatic agent 2001) . 3.2. Overview of available pharmacokinetic data constituents thereof is available on Centella asiatica extracts. In animal experiments, an in vivo transformation of asiaticoside into asiatic acid was established. T he acid increases significantly with increasing dose administrated, while the time point of maximum plasma concentration and the elimination half -life does not significantly change with increasing dose. In comparison with a single oral administration, repeated oral doses have been shown to significantly increase the maximum plasma concentration and the The possible mechanism reve a bio -availability varying between 30% and 50% (Brinkhaus et al. 2000). Madecassic acid crosses the skin rapidly but only to a limited extent. The plasma concentration did not exceed 0.02 to 0.05% of the initial applied concentration. Madecassoside is at the skin application site only 0.04% of the applied dose at 1 hour and about 0.06% after 24 hours. For asiatic acid similar results were observed. In man, active ingredients of Centella asiatica are excreted principally by faeces the forms of application has been investigated (Brinkhaus et al. 2000) . No pharmacokinetic interactions products are known. for oral administration of 1 g/kg body weight of ethanolic 50 Following administration, the mice was found by Dhar et al. (1968) to be 250 mg/kg body weight . Alcoholic extracts of Gotu Kola have shown doses of 350 mg/kg when given i.p. to rats (Alternative Medicine Review 2007). The oral LD50 of a 70% ethanolic dry extract from Centella 6:1 in rats was found to be higher than 675 mg/kg body weight (ESCOP 2009). In mice, a dose of 1 weight alcoholic (50:50) Centella asiatica extract did not lead to any toxic effects (no raw data are available). No mortality were recorded. High concentrations of asiaticoside applied derma of toxicity. Chronic oral administration of the extract to rats at 150 mg/kg for 30 days led to no significant differences in body weight or consumption of food and water, nor to plasma glucose, proteins, , it not to nella and and of eight plants were washed well with water. The p lant (300 g) was homogeni sed with 300 ml distilled water using a home -mixer, and the mixture was then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 9000 g for 30 min utes.

Gotu kola extract Centella is used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of anxiety. A double -blind, placebo -controlled study was acoustic response (ASR) in humans. The ASR the humans a sequence of physical responses, including an eye blink. The ASR is augmented by fear and anxiety and potentiated by anxiogenic orally administered dose of Gotu Kola (N = 20) or placebo (N = 20). Gotu Kola was administered as crude powder herb blended with grape juice and celery salt in order to make verum and placebo solutions identical in colour, smell and taste. The Kola significantly attenuated the peak ASR amplitude 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. The authors concluded that these preliminary anxiolytic activity in humans but it remains to be seen whether this herb has therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of anxiety syndromes (Bradwejn et al. 2000). A randomi sed, placebo double- blind study investigated the doses ranging 250, 500 and 750 mg once daily for 2 months.

No drug -related In a randomis ed cross- study involving subjects, Grimaldi investigated the absorption behaviour of TTFCA following both single and repeated oral doses (30 and 60 mg). The results suggest that active ingredients in TTFCA are well absorbed in human volunteers (Grimaldi et al. 1990). After single oral administration of the extract, maximum plasma levels of asiatic acid were reached at 4.5 and 4.2 hours, with 30 and 60 mg, respectively. P lasma half -lives were 2.2 hours in the 30 mg dose and 3.4 hours in the 60 mg dose. No detectable saponin was present 24 hours after single dosing. After repeated doses (7- day treatment) higher peak plasma concentrations, longer half -lives, acid but only to a limited extent. The plasma concentration did not exceed 0.02 to 0.05% of the initial applied concentration. Madecassoside is at the skin application site only 0. 04% of the applied dose at 1 hour and about 0.06% after 24 hours. For asiatic acid similar results were observed. In man, active ingredients of Centella asiatica are excreted principally by faeces forms of application have investigated (Brinkhaus et al. 2000) .

Following oral refined to TECA, are authorised in several Members States: Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain and the time elapsed since the first marketing authorisation is longer than 30 years. The medicinal use of TECA for a period of 30 years has been established on the basis of published literature and decisions taken by National Competent Authorities to grant marketing authorisations. There are several clinical st udies on the efficacy of TECA extract in CVI . They involve small numbers of patients, but they are all positive and no negative results are reported. Moreover the period of long standing use since more than 30 years of products containing TECA extract in t he EU Community, the pharmacological data, the plausibility of the efficacy in wound healing support the traditional use in this indication. No reasons of concerns relating the safety are reported and the tolerability of oral Centella asiatica preparations has generally been shown to be good in all studies. No adverse events from pharmacovigilance data are known. Assessment asiatica (L.) Urban, herba EMA/HMPC/291177/2009 Page 44/44 Based on the information on manufacturing process, the HMPC is of the opinion that TECA extract cannot be classified as an herbal due manufacturing steps and composition. Therefore, despite the existing data on the safety and efficacy and the historical use within the Community of products containing TECA extract, it is propose any monograph for this preparation, because all the data do not refer to a herbal preparation.
