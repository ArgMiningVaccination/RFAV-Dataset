Consequently, when comparing the per capita cost of ( [Figure 1]()) in IU/mL the anti-HBs test >10 IU/mL after hepatitis B vaccine before the accident with biological material, it was noted that the first cost was about 32 times more expensive for SUS ( [Table 1]()).

In cases of post-exposure management of unvaccinated HCW (scenario B - 4]()), being 32 times more expensive for SUS when the SAD was exposed to HBsAg-positive source-person and 31 times higher when the person-source was unknown. When comparing the per cost of primary vaccination (scenario D 4]()), the cost was around 32 times higher for SUS. Still in the scenario C ( [Figure 3]()), when comparing the per capita of HCW with negative anti-HBs exposed to unknown source-person (scenario D [Figure 4]()), the cost was 31 times more costly for SUS.

This study showed that the allocation of SUS resources to preventive measures, including the provision and monitoring of all HCW, is more economical than post-exposure management and these data can support public policies on worker health, ensuring greater security at a lower cost. Some gaps found in the SINAN-NET database were its limitation. Conclusion The direct cost of post-exposure prophylaxis for SUS was about 30 times more expensive than the costs of post-vaccination testing in those accidents in which the source-person was positive or unknown and the professional had unknown Scenarios A (branch three and four), scenario B (branch six and seven) and scenario C (branch 10 and 11) for post-exposure management to HBV when to test, showed greater per capita cost impact. Health managers can rely on the findings of this study for the implementation of the routine of carrying out the post-vaccination anti-HBs test, ensuring greater protection to the health of the worker with a reduction in the costs of post-exposure management related to HBV, optimizing scarce public resources in country. - * from master\u00b4s thesis \"The cost of GO, Brazil.
