This gathered from documented literatures in scientific database. Key findings The study revealed that S. mombin has nutritional values; with the leaf, fruit, flower, seed, and stem bark possessing a wide range and pharmacological activities. About 102 isolated compounds from the leaf, fruit, or stem bark of S. mombin have been reported. Summary the several pharmacological for purposes. from the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate a dominant 80% of our global population rely on significant role and improving the plants as synthesis pharmaceuticals, just as the has thus attracted focus in the pharmaceutical industries with regard to identifying novel bioactive principles for the treatment of current and unfolding health challenges. Like some known medicinal plants Linn serves in diverse in herbal medicine, with many ethnopharmacological properties for the management parts such as leaves, flower, fruits, seed, stem bark, pulp and root are ethnomedicinally viable have been described; all of which are linkable to the chemical constitution, as well as the nutritional compositions and benefits of several this plant across several cultures is a compendium of information around its utility and value, which are explorable for to a robust of ambiguity, chemists, pharmacologists and physicians. Search Strategy A review of scientific literature was compiled from the scientific database (such as Science Direct, Espacenet Web of Science, SciFinder, Scopus, PubMed, Scielo, Google Scholar, Google Patents, Springerlink, Mendeley) sources such as The Plant ( [http://www.theplantlist.org](http://www.theplantlist.org)), The International Plant Names Index ( [www.ipni.org](http://www.ipni.org)) and Plant Resources of Tropical Africa. Relevant and useful details (in relation to the botany and names, herbal properties and medicinal uses, phytochemistry as citation tracking from other publications, or by direct access to journal webpages. Keywords used for the identification of useful data are different scientific names, articles published between 1950 and 2022. Literature search was English language-based, except in a few cases of Portuguese and was translated to the English language. Results Origin, botany and morphology of Spondias mombin Spondias mombin the rainforest lowlands but has adapted to grow in more arid zones. The deciduous fruit tree is distributed in Nigeria (especially in the Southwestern regions), Ivory Coast, Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Colombia, Guianas, as well as a number of global tropical forests the world.[ [4](javascript:;), [5](javascript:;)] An evidence-based analysis and evaluation of African origin in comparison to the American region clarified that S. mombin can be dispersed naturally against the Africa.[ [6](javascript:;)] (Linn) is It is essentially a member of family Anacardiaceae, about 73 genera, 850 species. It is often referred to as Hog plum in the English-speaking tropical [Table 1](javascript:;) shows a of countries and localities and their various local names for the tree and fruits of S. mombin. Table 1: The geographical (Igbo) ||Jobo (Igbo) ||Jobo (Igbo) ||Jobo (Igbo) ||Jobo America ||Yellow by a thick and bark) as tall as 20-30 m with a trunk between 60 and 75 cm in diameter.[ [7](javascript:;)] The leaves are 20-45 cm petiolate leaflets and short petioles, while the flowers from the tree are usually white, and are produced abundant in small and fragrant panicles.[ [7](javascript:;)] The stomata of the leaf which are tetracytic/anomocytic spread out on the dorsal or abaxial surface; has a bulging symmetry bundles in a closed arc structure.[ [7](javascript:;)] The fruits are 3-4 cm in length, and 2.5 cm in width, with a tough, but thin skin, and a juicy pulp. These fruits are usually green on the onset and then become golden-yellow when they are ripe depending to the carotenoid composition. The seeds which are significantly big and rough are in the endocarp, which is a pentagonal structure covered with most of the is the endosperm, due to its thin and starchy nature. Plate 1: Spondias mombin tree (plant). In a study on S. tree morphology, normal morphology was seed to physical micropyle of S. mombin seeds has been reported to be the best pre-germination treatment.[ [10](javascript:;)] The physical and chemical characterization of the mature fruits from 14 adult plants of S. mombin revealed the range and average and physicochemical quality of the fruits may vary from one region to the other. For instance, differences were identified in the physical and physicochemical quality of the fruits in the two regions of Boa Vista, Roraima in a study on the biometric characterization of fruits and physicochemical characteristics increase with advancement in maturity, such that half the ripe fruits have fruits are climacteric and are known to have increase in CO2 and decrease in O2 concentration when stored in closed confines.[ [14](javascript:;)] Upon studying increase steadily and diseases.[ [16](javascript:;)] Like most tropical fruits, S. mombin fruits are tropical and present exotic taste and aroma well as good nutritional value. nutritional value such as rich mineral low moisture, and lipid also a source of carotenoids and compounds. The fruits from S. mombin are characteristically distinct with high amounts of vitamin A their epicarp.[ [17](javascript:;)] While investigating the nutritional values of S. mombin fruits, more light has been shed on the soluble solid, vitamin C, and mineral contents, well as pH accepted taste.[ [19](javascript:;)] fruit pulp is not affected by thermal treatment, with the fruit processing reported no depleting effect on antioxidant capacity.[ [20](javascript:;)] the development beverages made of S. mombin fruit and cashew apple with the addition of Fructooligosaccharides was health is notably phytonutrients like vitamins and minerals, from the addition of 5% S. mombin extract drinks S. mombin be insights use of the pulp extract in jam, juice, and ice cream production, but not on the micronutrient potentials of these fruit pulps.[ [24-28](javascript:;)] reported and recommended the pulps as fruit snacks acid (HCN) contents of S. mombin leaves on the performance and digestibility in goats and was reported that nitrogen balance and digestibility were also reported nitrogen, crude fibre, The nontoxic effect of S. mombin leaf meal blood in the use of S. mombin as a potential origin of valuable animal product formulation and feed stuff has been advocated, on the back of analytical of S. mombin pulp can supply up to 37% of recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin A.[ [35](javascript:;)] Moreso, the seed kernel was demonstrated as a valuable source of nutritious and respectively).[ Similarly, the leaf of S. mombin as a good haematinic and antidiabetic agent, owing high contents [37](javascript:;)] Results from this study revealed elemental constituents and 1.80%.[ [36](javascript:;)] properties. 35.78% and 32.59% respectively were rich in moisture. The leaf also with 32.08% was the richest in carbohydrate while the stem was richest in ash having a proportion of 4.52%. Each of the root, stem or leaf are rich in vitamins B1 and C in proportions above 2 mg/100 ml and 1 mg/100 ml respectively. Similarly, the leaf and stem have rich contents potassium and the pulps and -carotene, zeinoxanthin, foam dried at 60 \u00b0C (recommended to maintain the best characteristics of the fresh pulp) indicated preserved quality of S. of S. mombin fruits and their pulps revealed that the fruit has variable dimensions, and 16.47 g, characterization study of fruits 17 S. mombin yield, size, moisture, soluble carotenoids three great fruit matrices (above 15 g); four medium type (12-15 g) and the majority (10 matrices) presented small fruits (less than 12 g), and that S. mombin is not a source of ascorbic acid for food, on the evidence of low levels.[ [44](javascript:;)] In the work of Akharaiyi for the industrial of tropical juices from fruit pulping, homogenization loss of activity in the course of processing, with the final product indicating a 25% and 2.5% residual activity for seed residues deal study to make S. mombin flavor-frozen from goat milk, and to evaluate its sensory acceptance, it was shown that the use of 30% pulp constitution in goat milk frozen such The microscopic evaluation samples the of S. mombin collected in that scraps insects which indicated that no one of the samples was in line with the established quality standards for fruit Para\u00edba and Pernambuco States in Brazil revealed that revealed that 68.2% S. mombin pulp samples did not correlate with the QIS juice the by to 90% saturation level, and as agents against some mammalian digestive enzymes that may occur bagasse after MAAT, food application.[ [54](javascript:;)] The trade of S. mombin thrives on the need to provide alternative means to living through root is often used as source, while the stem serves as fences in farmlands, and shelter by artisans.[ [56](javascript:;)]S. mombin wood is used in the production of match sticks and boxes, pencils, and penholder, spatulas, interior overlay of homes and boats, and as an alternative for cork. Brazilians make seal wax with it and use it as bottle stoppers. In most parts of Africa, ashes from the wood is used as indigo-dye, while gum employed as mombin is used in the production of wine traded as Vinho de Taperiba, while the fruit is made into a cider-like drink in Guatemala.[ [56](javascript:;)] The trees utility as making, while branches are often used as garden poles, well as in making handles for axes and hoes. The use of the wood as a major source fuel or firewood is common among the people in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico.[ [56](javascript:;)]Spondias mombin serves as an efficient fuel nearly every part of the tree ranging from its fruit, leaves, seeds, stem bark, bark, to even flowers, has specific attributed regions of the world like Nigeria, Cuba, Peru, Mexico, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Brazil, Guianas, Belize, Venezuela, Haiti, Trinidad and Colombia. bleeding pregnancy, Skin of fruit is astringent. Fruit juice bleeding pregnancy, Skin of fruit is astringent. Fruit juice bleeding pregnancy, Skin of fruit is astringent. Fruit juice bleeding pregnancy, Skin of fruit is astringent. Fruit juice of the globe, S. mombin leaf is widely employed as treatments to get mammary milk production, as well as a vaginal wash either the a combination also of antimicrobial spectrum, yeast and candida). externally applied in [Table 2](javascript:;)). There has been reported claims of the local use of the leaf for memory enhancement in South-western Nigeria.[ [103](javascript:;), [104](javascript:;)] Similarly, the fruit is also acclaimed to have memory enhancement properties, as substantiated in a few studies.[ [105](javascript:;), [106](javascript:;)] The bark of the S. and the decoctions are its form of in cases the tree is predominantly as contraceptive and abortifacient, as mombin are functional in herbal medicine. urethritis, stomachache, biliousness and cystitis of eyes and throat.[ [60](javascript:;)] The fruit is usually consumed in form of mild laxative and can induce vomiting when consumed large from green plants have led to the production of some high activity profile drugs.[ [129](javascript:;)] The medicinal attributes of Major of plant and their reported ethnomedicinal uses has prompted several types of research on its phytochemistry. For instance, volatile S. mombin pulp or juice has been detailed, two of The noted that not just a single compound was responsible for the traditional fruit aroma, but the S. mombin fruit recorded a total of 46 and 28 volatiles, present in the free and glycosidically bound fractions, Gas chromatography-mass oils.[ [151](javascript:;)] The major responsible for the fruit aroma ( [Table 3](javascript:;)). In another study, S. mombin fruits analysed by GC and GC-MS were reported to have a total of 261 compounds, made up of 32 hydrocarbons (4.1%), were acids, 5.5% alcohols and ethers, while 1.1% made [149](javascript:;)] identified, comprising 5, and leaves, principal Notably, there were new detailed reports of the essential oil of S. mombin leaf.[ [163](javascript:;)] On the other hand, the analysis of the stem bark essential oil of S. mombin, in an reported that the oil of S. mombin leaf was rich beta-caryophyllene and of mombin leaves and fruits[ [153](javascript:;)] was not characterized in the study. Diterpene phytol, the major component in the leaves, was characterized and reported to be biorelevant with regards to its antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities.[ [140](javascript:;)] It is thus indicative to note that essential oil from S. mombin leaf, generally has a potential frontier role in studies, indicated responsible for sweet fruity fruit pulp, whereas -pinene, myrcene and substances the inflammation site[ [166](javascript:;)] which possibly explains the common use of leaves for different types of pain. In addition to having salicylic acid similarities with the phenolic acid, i.e., the long-chain compound, and the two ellagitannins and galloygeraniin), stem bark, via spectroscopic analysis.[ [169](javascript:;)] This was after an earlier report that the stem bark has an abundant constitution of cardiac glycosides, were isolated from S. mombin.[ [158](javascript:;)] Mombintane II from leaf.[ [173](javascript:;)] In Brazil, endophytic fungi were isolated from leaf blades (822 isolates) and (690 S. mombin. Guignardia gloeosporioides Phomopsis sp. were the recovered from the rachis of the 13 leaf and bark of S. mombin were reported,[ [174](javascript:;)] while the 0.0022% antioxidant high pro-vitamin compounds of S. mombin fruit were analysed for total phenols and flavonoids, antioxidant and hemolysis inhibition in human blood assays, with claims that the fruits are a good source of antioxidants.[ [179](javascript:;)] The report indicated that aqueous extract possessed the efficacy of conferring human erythrocytes studied, while the was attributed were a total of 23 including gallic acid, and resorcinol. Others included chlorogenic acid, catechin and ellagic acid. Owing to the richness of the leaf, root, and stem has been highlighted and recommended for drug formulation in pharmaceutical industries.[ [180](javascript:;)] The preliminary phytochemical screening of the leaf and stem bark extracts of S. mombin, indicated In addition, the leaf extract contained more vitamins C and E than the stem bark extracts.[ [181](javascript:;)] The leaf, bark, and root of S. mombin harvested in Umudike, Nigeria of S. mombin,[ [30](javascript:;)] while the compound responsible for the flavour was identified [148](javascript:;)] 3](javascript:;)). It has of the plant have varying medicinal properties owing to the richness in S. were the leaf of S. mombin.[ [100](javascript:;)] Novelty was reported in out of other compounds indicated that S. mombin is a promising and leaf, indicated the presence of 22 compounds: the identified were the ester, alcohol, and fatty acid groups.
