This work intended to modify the way we conceive the wellbeing of the main River of the city of Buenos Aires, the Rio de la Plata. First, to understand the current state of the river, the work borrowed a technique by Masaru Emoto, who claims water has memory and responds to negative or positive stimuli. He confirms this theory with microscopic photographs of crystallised water drops. Once the first photograph of a crystal of the river was taken, I invited Dr. Mario Draiman, Professor of Institute', and Historian and Architect Marta Miras, specialised in the history of the Rio de la Plata, to diagnose the actual state of this river and determine an homeopathic treatment according to its symptoms. The resulting diagnosis was published and became part of the exhibition. Dr. Draiman prescribed Nux Vomica. A homeopathic dosing machine was created slowly supplied homeopathy into the river. The treatment's effect on the River was followed by re-taking a crystal photo once a week, which was supervised by Dr. Mario Draiman during the exhibition. The Next video took place at the 10\u00ba Congress of the Federation of Medical Homeopathic Associations of Argentina. Here Dr Mario Draiman, Director of the Homeopathic Association presented our collaboration to the audience and openly discussed how a river can be treated with homeopathy as an alternative. "}
