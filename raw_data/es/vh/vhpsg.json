If consumption trends remain unchanged, tobacco will kill more than people each year by 20301. In many parts of the world, there is a trend for both women and men to start smoking tobacco at youn ger and younger to the high incidence and mortality rates that occur worldwide, and the family, work and economic problems that it genera - tes2. The main known cause of bladder cancer is tobacco, which is attributed to about 50% of all diagnosed cases. Introduction Abstract Resumen Tobacco does not only affect airway urine, greatly affecting the cells of the wall of our nary tract. Bladder cancer is urine, greatly the wall of our urinary tract4. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but is less common in women5. By 2020, the American Cancer Society estimates for this ca ncer in the United States are - About 81,400 new cases of bladder cancer, of which 62,100 will be men and 19,300 will be women - About 17,980 people will die from bladder cancer (about 13,050 men and 4,930 of bladder were diagnosed in Spain (17,439 in men and 3,564 in women), which places this tumour in fifth place in terms of incidence in Spain, according to data published by the Spanish - ty of Medical Oncology (SEOM)4. Bladder tumours accou 10% of tumours in men. They predominantly affect men (4:1 ratio with women)5,6. Bladder cancer is fifth most in developed countries, with approximately 357,000 new cases per year worldwide (274,00 0 men and 83,000 women). It represents 3.3% of all tumours (4.7% in men and 1.6% in women)7. The sex ratio is 3.3 men to every woman in the world, 3.8 in Europe, and 7 in Spain 7, where some 12,200 cases are diagnosed annually, representing female tumours (1,500 ca- ses). In women, both incidence and mortality are low and relatively stable. The incidence in Spain is among the hig- hest in the world, being the fourth most frequent tumor in men, after lung, pr ostate and colorectal tumors (adjus 33 new cases/100,000 inhabi - tants/year). Only in Egypt are more with a tendency to increase slowly7. Prostate cancer in Cuba, as in many countries in the world, is one of the main health problems. In 2002 this disease represented 16.9% of all malignant tumours in men, except for skin cancer, surpassed only by lung cancer and with a rate adjusted to the world population of 25.8 per 100 000 inhabitants. The a bsolute number of new cases per year has increased from 1 711 in 1992 to 2 087 in 2002; with respect to mortality, the number increased from 1560 in 1993 to 2 167 in 2004. In Villa Clara, can- cer is the leading cause of death; prostate cancer preceded by lung cancer8. Almost all of them are associated with the habit of smo - king as a major risk factor, since this addiction has ex - perienced a notable rise in Cuba, currently the country with the highest number of smokers in the region and ranked 38th globally8. Between 2012 and 2017, 266 new cases have been diagnosed, 80% of which are male and 20% female. From 2014 onwards, 33 cases of superficial bladder tumours and 51 invasive cases have been diag - 80% of trials carried out are aimed at cancer therapy, as this is the second cause of death in the territory. Almost all are associated with smoking as the most important risk factor, since this addiction has expe - rienced a notable rise in Cuba, currently the country with the highest number of smokers in the region and ranked 38th globally9. Bladder cancer is the sixth leading cause of death in Cu- ban men and the tenth in women10. It is considered a \"silent disease\", because while the ce lls are transformed and increase, up to 10 years can pass without symptoms. The true cause of prostatic carcinoma is unknown, but it is clear that its growth is influenced by sex hormones. It is common for the symptoms of prostatic carcinoma to appear in the late phase of its development and are usua - lly due to local patients show that mortality from this disease is the leading cause of death between the ages of 50 and 64 and the second most common among the age groups 5 -49 and 65 and older, and has the greatest impact on life expectancy at birth for Cubans. Each year, more than 27 ,000 new cases are diagnosed and more than 18,000 deaths are recorded. From 1990 to 2005, cancer mortality in Cuba has increased by 2% per year. Death itself cannot be avoided, however, it can be postponed. of this fact for health has moti vated the development of measures since long ago. The rise in mortality due to malignant tumours could be a more serious problem in the future in Cuba, given the ageing process the Cuban cess will imply a greater demand for human, material and financial resources for the treatment of this disease, as well as for the implementation of preventive service, this pathology is highly frequent in recent years. There are statistics at the national level on the morbidity and mortality of this disease, thanks to re - ports of cancer when the diagnosis is confirmed, but there are no studies that in our service; there are only studies related to the behavior to be followed in these patients as well as the use and this disea - se has been referred to as the fleshing of the in smokers unknown. More than 60 carcinogens are present in tobacco, II enzymes may potentiate urothelial damage. This work provides information on the behaviour of this pathology in the urology service, as well as providing gui - dance on how to work on the basis of earl y diagnosis and therapy of this pathology. improving health tional study was performed at the Urology Service of the Celestino Hern\u00e1ndez Hospital, in the municipality of San- ta Clara, Villa Clara Province, in the period 2014 -2019. The inclusion criteria are determined based on hospitalized patients diagnosed with papillary transi - Revista Latinoamericana de Vol. 15 - N\u00ba 2, 2020 tional cell bladder carcinoma and on their medical records according to the survey carried out for this research. To conduct this study with a sample of 147 patients we used a multivariable system that included, age, sex, race, residence location, toxic ha bits that might be related to the disease, as well as personal and family pathological history possibly linked to disease. The absolute in percent were presented in tables; from these data some corresponding graphs were presented, gene - rally pie and bar to better illustrate the behavior of certain indicators. the main general variables stu- died, the prevalence in the study group of patients between 55 and 74 years of age stands out, for 65% of cumulative frequency; however, 33.3% predominated in the age range 65 and 74 years, although there was very little difference with the age ran - ge 55 and 64 years. Male p atients with 74.8% tripled their value (37 in this entity. The whi- te race with 84.4% and the rural area with 70.7% (104 cases) prevailed between half and one third of the total population (147 cases), analysis that is shown in figure 1. Figure 1.

Of the total number of patients, 68.71% had no personal pathological history, only presented this type of history.

About nine out of 10 people with this cancer were over 55 years old. The average age at diagnosis was 73, and men were about three to four times more likely to develop bladder cancer in in whites compa - red to blacks, and the presence of metastases to the lung and regional lymph nodes were the most affected sites. Similar results were found in previous studies of showed a significant decreasing trend between 1990 and 2005. On the other hand, in a longi - tudinal study, mortality rates from bladder cancer in men were more than twice as high as in women. Since this is part of the group of tobacco -depen dent neoplasms, its incidence - lence of the habit and by changes in it over time15. The differences found in both genders can be attributed to the fact that women are less exposed to risk factors than men, and that their exposure (their increased tobacco use and exposure to high -risk working conditions) is more recent.18. An example is Spain, where dark tobacco is re- as having a greater impact in the recurrence or progression of superficial tumors.
