For 20 years (1976-1995), Bill worked at America's leading health and wellness publisher, Rodale, Inc. He started as an associate editor of Prevention Magazine in 1976, and became a senior editor of Prevention in 1978 and assistant managing editor in 1980. In 1982, he was promoted to managing editor of Prevention Magazine Health Books, and in 1984 to executive editor. In 1986, he became editor-in-chief of Rodale Books, including Prevention Magazine Health Books. From 1986 to 1995, Bill was the editorial executive who helped lead Rodale Books from $100 million to $250 million in yearly sales, managing an editorial staff of 125 people, and supervising the publication of 75 books a year, including the mega-selling The Doctors Book of Home Remedies copies A longtime spiritual practitioner, Bill to leave Rodale in 1995 to become the volunteer publishing director of The Dawn Horse Press, the publication division of his spiritual community, Adidam. I read this book after I saw it recommended by an Amazon reviewer. After reading it, I really couldn't imagine wanting to recommend this book to anyone myself, unfortunately. For one thing the sections in the book were mainly geared towards minor conditions such as dry hair, warts, foot odour and so on. Where more serious mentioned, often very simplistic advice was given, perhaps or vitamin or recommendations and advice on relaxation and visualisation exercises. Many important recommendations for diseases that are in just about every other book, were left out entirely making this book a very poor choice as a sole source of treatment advice. Of course it may help if you have a simple condition and no knowledge at all of vitamin therapies and so on... but you are missing out by not getting the full picture you would with a better book that had more concrete medical information based on studies and facts. There are lots of them! My second and much larger problem with the book was the huge focus on mumbo jumbo, not just any old sort but `blame the victim' mumbo jumbo. That books can just make such absurd and stupid statements and claims with no claims made are like...more like fairytales than anything to do with science. The milder side of this is where for example, visualisation exercises are recommended to get rid of warts. Mostly that is just silly, but it's probably not going to do you any harm...or any good! But I think that for example where it is claimed that thyroid bottling up and thoughts' is very different. That is them themselves through their personality or behaviour, or just as bad, told that changing their behaviour can change the condition. It's potentially harmful, and abusive. I'm an M.E., most of whom have thyroid problems as part of the disease; a disease caused by a virus that can these with M.E. or thyroid problems has the same personality is silly in the extreme. (And some of us are very very big talkers!) To help patients relax and meditate and reduce stress in their lives in order to promote healing is fine, but why sully this very good with fairytale nonsense that helps nobody and unfairly blames ill people for their predicament. In this day and age there is no excuse for it. Relation techniques and mediation are wonderful things, its such a shame when they are tied to a dodgy new age `the mind causes most of the body's illnesses' agenda. An agenda that seems to be about people being able to feel superior to those that are ill, or safe from illness themselves due to their `superior' thinking style. It may people off these very important and scientifically valid therapies. What I did like about the book were the imaginative sections on how to cope with grief and how to cope with nightmares. I thought these sections were very good and may even be quite helpful. The idea that nightmares were often positive as they were helping you to solve problems in your life, and that it can be a good idea to write them down and analyse them, and even to work out/imagine what you could have done, or made happen differently and how they could have ended more positively was good. I was also relieved to the factually incorrect, at least wouldn't be likely to cause very safe supplements were recommended (eg. CoQ10). As `CFS' is made up of those with many hundreds of different conditions it would be unlikely to get to the root cause of almost any of them either and can only delay proper diagnosis and treatment ('CFS' wastebasket diagnosis), but at least doing no better than most books manage! It's a relief every time when exercise is NOT recommended, as this can ruin the lives of M.E. patients, many of whom are sadly misdiagnosed with `CFS.' Unfortunately Dr Teitelbaum provided this information, and any book which supports this problematic doctor and his generally misleading and harmful information on `CFS' does not inspire a lot of trust or respect. Overall though, I couldn't bible' instead, if you want the solid facts and more useable and thorough information, free Hummingbirds' Foundation for Myalgic Encepahalomyelitis This is a great little book to refer to for not so serious everyday life issues. mostly simple remedies that might keep you from having to go straight to a doctor for most minor issues. it also recommends some good vitamins and herbs to help reduce the severity of some "}
