She is a recently arrived immigrant struggling to find her place in continues to practice traditional in the way she cooks but also in the way she dresses and generally behaves. Her husband, on the other hand, thinks it would be good for his wife to learn to drive (which Mrs. Sen is reluctant to do) so that she can visit the fish market to obtain fresh cooking ingredients by herself. Meanwhile, Mrs. Sen finds employment as a babysitter. The immigrant and Eliot, the child she is in charge of, quickly form a mutual bond of respect. Together, the two characters learn about each other's cultures and their places within larger American society. With the encouragement of Eliot, however, Mrs. Sen attempts to drive to the fish monger herself and ends up crashing the car with Eliot sitting by her side. After that episode, Eliot's mother removes her son from Mrs. Sen's care and the story concludes. 4Many of Lahiri's stories may be the developing hallmark of Lahiri's growing body of work. According to Friedman, - 1 In a 2013 interview with The New York fiction,\" arguing American writers whose novels, short fiction, and assimilation\u2014cleaving to the hope of an \"American Dream\"\u2014is no longer at the heart of the immigrant story. Instead of shedding the trappings of the home culture and throwing himself headlong into the work of Americanizing, the protagonist of the contemporary immigrant [narrative]\u2014whether an immigrant or a child born to immigrants\u2014is more concerned with his or her dual identity as it manifests itself in America and in at an accelerated pace. As Berry points out, \"acculturation takes place in the settled or dominant group as well as in the non-dominant group\" (701). Like immigrants, native-born children are vulnerable to rapid cultural change, whether it is in their contemporaneous American experiences or in their unstable, modern lives generally. The transmigrations of thought and behavior that cultural change demands and inflicts on individuals is happening in children and immigrants in a way that is both transgenerational and transnational (Sakthi and Venkatraman 108). 6One of the best ways to observe acculturation and the narrative structure of chiasmus in Lahiri's work is by examining Mrs. Sen, the adult immigrant, and Eliot, the native-born child, with their understanding of the concept of Home. As the possessive form of Lahiri's title suggests, the unspoken word is \"home.\" Home (X) is the central thought unit between the adult immigrant (A) and the native-born child (B), in which the parallel components (A/A and simultaneously build the case of \"Mrs. Sen's\": (A) Adult immigrant teaches new cooking skills (B) child learns Indian culinary ways (X) Home (Mrs. Sen's physical home and Indian homeland) (X) Home (Eliot's physical home and American homeland) (B) Native-born child teaches American independence (A) Adult immigrant learns driving skills/taking risks 7Home in this example is at the Sen's domicile the macrocosm . take place at a micro . . . or a macro level\" (19). Chiasmus (ABBA) is a common pattern of assimilation within an immigrant family, in which the native-born children are the translators and, in many instances, the teachers of their immigrant parents, helping them to navigate their way into and through a New World. - 2 Charles Leadbeater provides a succinct description of the mix their experiences and their identities between the old and the new. In this way, the transmigration of thought and behavior is seen on [2](#ftn2) chiastic a The author skillfully uses this structure to write some of the most solemn and reverent short stories in contemporary English language. The title character of \"Mrs. Sen's\" is a new wife but raised in Calcutta, India to America by her Indian husband who teaches mathematics at a local university. Home for Mrs. Sen continues to reside in India: \"'Everything is there'\" (113), she says to Eliot's mother during her interview for the job of babysitter; it is a worldview that begins and ends with the homeland as locus of control and it reverberates throughout Lahiri's stories and her characters' (dis)orientation \"food tropology\" ex [(...)](#ftn3) 9Mrs. Sen recognizes her dependence on others and her she says, \"'I am learning . . But I am a slow student\" (113). Considering that her husband is a college professor, it is notable that Mrs. Sen perceives herself as a student: she occupies a traditionally subordinate and, in many ways, an immature role, not only as wife and woman but as thinker and agent in the traditions and habits of her homeland by the way she cooks and dresses, by the way she acts toward her husband, by the way she longs for her life in Calcutta, and by the way she refuses to adopt American customs. Mrs. Sen continues methods with a special knife handed down to her by her mother. As Paromita Deb argues, Mrs. Sen challenges \"the Western concept of and mobility as she partly demonstrates . . . a different autonomy and agency a performance of daily chores, like cooking and serving food, within one's as constrictive, delimiting space [and] perceives nuances (128). Mrs. Sen's lesson not lost on Eliot. He quickly learns to take his shoes off when entering the home and vegetables preparing meals, helping Mrs. Sen, at times, when asked. Mrs. Sen may be stumbling through the process of acculturation, but there are signs of hope for her. According to Madhuparna Mitra, \"Perhaps we are meant to see [Mrs. Sen] as a snapshot of a woman in the early years of her life as a struggling immigrant\" (195). Mrs. Sen may be struggling to acculturate outside her home, but she is the indisputable master homemaker within it. 10Growing pains are a constant part of life for the immigrant as well as for the developing child\u2014in order to succeed into acculturation or adulthood grow. in a creating a childlike dependence on her more assimilated husband, but also on every other character in the story from the fishmonger to the policeman, as well speech patterns. In the same way a child begins to recognize the impending precipice of an autonomous consciousness, Mrs. a that would test with a \"scream\" the very distance she must travel away from her homeland into otherness: \"'Eliot, if I began to scream right now at top of my lungs, would someone come?'\" (Lahiri, Interpreter 116). American independence forces on individuals, Mrs. Sen imagines the kind of panic a child might feel when separated from those who would protect her in times of crisis. Subsequently, when Mrs. Sen grows frustrated at her inability to navigate the speed of change through the very symbol of modern American culture\u2014the automobile\u2014she resorts to expressing herself with a kind of baby-talk: \"'Everyone, this people, too much in their world'\" (121). The American automobile epitomizes at once the isolation and the freedom of American independence, as well as the risk of accepting a practice that fosters and celebrates such an impersonal and transient approach is changing, but slowly. Her inability to learn how to drive is a struggle toward (or resistance to) acculturation. 11Eliot's displacement from his home, on the other hand, has the opposite effect on him: the child acquires a great deal of maturity and independence because his culture forces him away. Eliot is the child of divorced parents, living alone with a mother who works fifty miles from home and must employ a series of \"baby-sitters\" to supervise her son. Mrs. Sen is only the recent and\u2014as it turns out\u2014final caretaker. Eliot's from his estranged father appear unquestioned by him in a way that Mrs. Sen can only begin to comprehend: \"'You are wiser than [I was at your You already taste the way things must be'\" (123). At eleven years of age, Eliot has been raised in a culture that cultivates a \"taste\" for dislocation and independence from the earliest stages of life. As Eliot's mother is sure to point out, her son \"'can feed and entertain himself.'\" She already views Eliot as self-sufficient and self-reliant in some of the most basic and superficial ways. She puts no emphasis on her son's education or on his character development. The baby-sitters are only secured \"'in case of an emergency'\" (111). This reason, however, seems to emerge more from his mother's guilty feelings toward her son than from any honest concern for her son's safety, when only a few short months later (after the car accident), she tells him that he's \"'a big boy now'\" (135) and can stay home alone. It is something the reader senses throughout the story and Eliot's mother needs only a final excuse to exercise her real desire for Eliot to care for himself. The short list of character traits from previous babysitters\u2014a distracted and disinterested university student, a closet alcoholic and an apprehensive, if not dangerous, driving student, Mrs. Sen\u2014lays bare the ideological and cultural philosophy of the story's dominant culture: being on one's own (independent) in American is safer than being with others. 12Eliot, however, plays his adult so well that he is even capable of appropriating the job of driving instructor previously held by Mr. Sen, directing Mrs. Sen with such self-assuredness that it is easy to imagine Eliot driving the car himself: \"'You need to wait until no one's coming'\" and \"'You have to turn and speed up fast'\" (120). To Eliot, driving \"seemed so simple when he sat beside his mother, gliding in the evenings back to the beach house\" (120-21). The boy's ease with American mobility and, consequently, independence is second nature. Although Eliot's confidence may be the inspiration for Mrs. the narrative highlights \"the ways in which the in Lahiri's stories functions as a translator among cultures\" (Friedman 121). Eliot, the child, is the one encouraging the adult to change and grow, almost demanding it from her. Lahiri turns the relationships between children and immigrants inside out. Mrs. Sen, the immigrant adult, appears to need more practice and more guidance before she reaches the same level of maturity/acculturation as Eliot, the native-born child. 13The same chiastic structure can be seen just as clearly in other stories in Lahiri's debut collection. In \"When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine,\" the adult immigrant, Mr. Pirzada, is a university professor who is eager to learn new things Lilia, the ten-year-old narrator and native-born American-Indian girl, a pumpkin into a jack-o-lantern. Lilia teaches him in a tone and manner close to those in which Eliot teaches Mrs. Sen to drive, when she tells Mr. Pirzada, \"'First go around the top, like this'\" (Lahiri, Interpreter 35), demonstrating with her index finger pumpkin. Lilia and Mr. Pirzada's is the one consoling Mr. Pirzada, telling him not to worry about her safety while trick-or-treating during Halloween (38). The roles of student and teacher continue to intersect when Lilia is moved to read a book about Mr. Pirzada's homeland, for which she is scolded by her middle-school teacher because it has taken time away from her report about the American Revolution. Still, each night as Lilia drifts off to sleep, she hears Mr. Pirzada and her parents \"anticipating the birth of a nation on the other side of the world\" (34). Lilia, a second-generation Indian girl born in the United States, realizes that for her family's dinner guest was being lived in Dacca first\" (30) and in the United States second, just as Mrs. Sen longs for news from her homeland. The learning and teaching that takes place in these crosswise relationships between adults and native-born children teaching to and learning from one another about their respective home lives. The native-born, Miranda, presently twenty-two years old, is having an affair with an Indian man, who is married. Much of the story revolves around Miranda learning about the ethnic Indian woman with whom she works and the ethnic Indian man with whom she has sex. At one point, Miranda has a flashback to her nine-year-old self, when she encountered a painting of the Indian goddess Kali at the bottom of a stairway in her neighbor's home: the naked goddess has a red face, enormous white eyes, two circles for breasts; she brandishes a dagger in one hand and crushes a struggling man on the ground; she wears a necklace of bleeding heads and is sticking out her tongue (95-96). Kali is the goddess of Death. Beside \"a heavy aroma of (95)\u2014more ethnic food/cooking imagery\u2014it is the image of Kali that Miranda remembers most about her Indian neighbor's home and the one that instills fear in her childhood months afterward. In her adult life, however, it is an image that shames Miranda (96), for Kali is also the goddess of sexuality and femininity, a in depth, trying to eat its food and learn its language, to make sense of her situation and acquire, presumably, agency in her relationships. Although Miranda, the child, learns the name of this goddess from her neighbor, Mrs. Dixits, the immigrant adult, she does not learn its true significance until her present experience in an affair forces her mind open. Miranda is caught between two worlds: she is trying to come to terms with her American life as the mistress of a married man, but also as the lover of a man who is an Indian immigrant. However, it is a seven-year-old, native-born child, Rohin, the don't know'\" (107). It is a lesson that comes to Miranda as an adult, but it comes to her through childhood. Rohin, in fact, commands Miranda to eat, to draw, to wear her dress the same way Lilia commands Mr. Pirzada to carve a pumpkin and not to worry, or the way Eliot commands Mrs. Sen to drive and take risks. In \"Sexy,\" Miranda may be the embodiment of a grown-up Eliot or Lilia struggling with her own m\u00e9tissage as an adult. 15Inversely, Eliot and Mrs. Sen share a remarkable bond with each other based on a traditional mother/son or adult/child relationship. Mrs. Sen is clearly characters. Her master cooking skills, and attention to filial relationships all make Mrs. Sen the most admirable woman in the story. According to Friedman, Lahiri \"elevates the immigrant as the person who deserves respect and admiration not only for making the voyage to America but also for struggling to maintain cultural ties to a faraway homeland\" (124). Eliot is quick to recognize Mrs. Sen's strengths the way any intelligent, impressionable child might. Eliot's easy acceptance of Mrs. Sen as his babysitter is revealing: \"Eliot didn't mind going to Mrs. Sen's after school. By September [the story begins at the start of the new school year] the tiny beach house where he and his mother lived year-round was already cold\" Mrs. Sen's comes quickly. and lively, a sharp contrast to Eliot's native Michael Cox and cultural accommodation\" (120). Eliot is Lahiri's window for us to admire Mrs. Sen's struggle to acculturate but also Indian identity. In contrast, Eliot's mother seems to live in a cultural and psychological wasteland, and appears a not unlike Lilia's description, in \"When Mr. Pirzada Came to pathways. clearly the immigrant in a way that highlights his openness and her strengths. As such, the reader crosses another line of unfixed identity, but it is in the direction of the native-born child rather than the adult characters. 16Mrs. Sen's in their own world\"\u2014becomes a distinctive pattern that Mrs. Sen and Eliot find crossing and out of repeatedly throughout is but also proxy; Mrs. Sen is childlike in her dependence on others but also an adult in her cultural identity; Eliot is adult-like in his independence but also a child in his aptitude for change and potential for growth. In the frequent representations of extreme care and neglect. Repetitions of this occur in a variety of including whole neighborhoods, marital and extramarital relationships, and relationships and (456). In \"Mrs. Sen's,\" this latter dichotomy is less a divide children and adults than a mixing of unstable experiences between the acculturating immigrant and the developing American child. Lahiri's final short story in the book, \"The Third and Final Continent,\" becomes the great example of chiasmus when the roles of immigrant and native, that is, child and adult, are inverted. A 103-year-old American matriarch feels more disoriented about modern America, represented by a flag on the moon in 1969, than her younger, male Indian lodger, who finds his life's cross-cultural journey from India to some thirty years later \"ordinary.\" In \"Mrs. Sen's,\" readers see a child and an immigrant growing together beyond the bounds of any fixed identity or cultural landscape to become something new. Yet, Lahiri's chiastic narrative structure that gives her characters "}
