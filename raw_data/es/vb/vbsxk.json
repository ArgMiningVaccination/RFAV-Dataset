The addition of bores would with river water to ensure sufficient quantities of water in the dry season, used to lower suspended during the wet season. There is a likelihood that there will be traces of iron and manganese in the bore water, but the use of DMI65 filtration media will remove this and provide an improvement the usual high turbidity and suspended raw water could be greatly reduced by clarification prior to entering the water treatment plant. The existing plant is fixed in size and capacity, however a pre-clarification stage will dramatically reduce the load current plant. A traditional clarifier and upstream floc/polymer dosing cost well over USD $1M and take up a considerable land area to install and was therefore not practical in this case. With a very low retention time this type of system would also require carried out using the range of samples and highlighted a particular polymer most suited to this raw water. A local polymer supply company is able to supply a very similar product in powdered form and at a very reasonable price that would suit the mixing/batching system mentioned CHANGE-OUT IN RAPID SAND FILTERS During our visit one of the rapid sand filters was drained for inspection. The sand in the filters has never been changed and is now very hard-packed and is in need of replacement. The filter was filled whilst we were watching and the infiltration rate of the incoming water was very poor with most of the water just flowing across over the top of the sand and down through cracks in the hard packed sand rather than down through it. We proposed to replace [DMI65\u00ae filtration media](http://dmi65.com/es/tecnicas/how-it-works/). The will remove the existing with any rise in iron or manganese levels that can be encountered raw water sources with varying quality. The DMI65 a low level of free (0.2-0.3mg/L) to activate the media. This is easily only requires moving of the existing chlorine dosing point to just prior to the media filters. The chlorine residual will remain and still act as for the treated and replacement of the filtration nozzles improved not only the quality of water from the media filters, but also the quantity of water through the filters. Sample Results With a peak NTU of 1000 and an average inlet TSS of 286 you can see that the outlet of lagoon B has been maintained generally around 80 NTU with an average of 86 NTU. OVERALL PLANT OUTPUT The results from the plant post media filters after the replacement of the old sand media with the new DMI65 media have been consistently excellent. The expected results were: < < 2 NTU Sample Results Media Filter Performance - NTU In Vs Out Summary Quantum believes that the upgrade has been a success, "}
