The potential energy from Peruvian agricultural and forestry resources is described quantitatively. Potental regional production of agricultural residues and forest resources that could supply energy are identified. Assessment of resource development training, development, external policy and pricing, and transportation. Nine biofuel technology options for Peru are identified: (1) small-to-medium-scale gasification, (2) a wood waste inventory, (3) stationary and mobile charcoal production systems, (4) wood distillation, (5) forest resource development and management, (6) electrical cogeneration, (7) anaerobic digestion technology, (8) development of ethanol production capabilities, and (9) agricultural strategies for fuel production. Applications of these biofuel options are identified for each of the three major regions - nine applications for the Costa Region, eight for the Sierra Region, and ten for the Selva Region. [[Cedrela odorata (Meliaceae) potential for dendrochronological studies in the Selva Central of Per\u00fa].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102658) Pereyra Espinoza, Manuel Jes\u00fas; Inga Guillen, Gaby Janet; 2014-06-01 past 20 years, searching dendrochronological potential in tropical and subtropical tree species, tropical dendrochronology, is still in a development stage. The aim of this research was to determine the potential of C. odorata for dendrochronological studies in the Selva Central of Per\u00fa. The tree-ring anatomical characteristics were carefully examined and we 215 (1795-2 009) tree-ring tree-ring was developed based on of clearly delimited by large pore diameters in earlywood and small ones in latewood associated marginal and paratracheal parenchyma. The tree-ring were with the previous rainy season and late dry season of the current growth period. Moreover, we found close relationship between tree growth and total precipitations of the hydrological period (December to demonstrate the influence of rainfall at different stages of C. odorata radial growth. The good discrimination of annual rings, strong relationship with precipitation, the wide range and longevity of trees (200 years) make C. odorata a very promising species for dendrochronological studies in tropical and subtropical forest of America. [Extreme hydrometeorological events in the Peruvian Central Andes during austral summer and their relationship with the large-scale associated with extreme hydrometeorological events in the Mantaro Basin, Peruvian Central Andes, and their teleconnections during the austral summer (December-January-February-March) are addressed. Extreme rainfall events in the Mantaro basin related to variations the large-scale Low are associated a weakening (strengthening) of the BH-NL system and reduced (enhanced) influx of moist air from the lowlands to the east due to westerly (easterly) wind anomalies at mid- and upper-tropospheric levels. time rainfall events of the opposite sign occur over northeastern due activity in conjunction with a strengthened (weakened) Cold episodes in Mantaro Basin are grouped in three episodes. and strong cold episodes in the MB are mainly associated with a weakening of the BH-NL system due to tropical-extratropical interactions. Both types of cold episodes are associated wind anomalies at mid- and upper-tropospheric levels aloft which the influx of humid air masses from the lowlands to the east and hence limit the potential for development of convective resulting clear sky conditions cause nighttime to drop, cold extremes below the 10-percentile. Extraordinary cold episodes in the MB are associated with cold and dry polar air advection at all tropospheric levels toward the central Peruvian Andes. weak and cold episodes in the MB for LEARNING AN ETHNIC DIVIDE: PERUVIAN PARENTS AND A JAPANESE SCHOOL](https://www.openaire.eu/search/publication?articleId=dedup_wf_001::3efa7bb4ce97be360063325808839067) Moorehead, Robert 2007-01-01 This article presents a case study of relations between Japanese teachers and Peruvian parents at a public elementary school in central Japan. Using interviews and participant observation, this increasingly foreign body, blame problems at the school on Peruvian parents' limited stress which ultimately result in regional uplift of the overriding plate. This has particularly been inferred by most studies for the western margin of the Peruvian Andes. However, local geological observations have contested this idea. Here, we present a review of existing local and international literature supplemented by new structural and observations that suggest that nearly the entire (15\u00b0 to 11\u00b0 S latitude) and northern Peruvian forearc (11\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 S latitude) are under extension with a slight tendency to transtension instead of compression, and that this region has experienced a prolonged period of subsidence since the middle-late Eocene, interrupted by short pulses of uplift. In contrast, the southern Peruvian forearc (15\u00b0 to 18\u00b0 S latitude) has experienced (trans)tension from the middle-late Eocene until recent in combination with uplift. The central and southern Peruvian forearc that was influenced by the passage of the Nazca ridge experienced transtension and subsidence until the These new findings on the geodynamic development of the Peruvian forearc need to be considered in future reconstructions of the mechanisms at work within this subduction zone. [Cold episodes in the Peruvian Central Andes: Composites, Types, and their Impacts over South America The Mantaro basin (MB) is located in the central Peruvian Andes. Occasionally, cold episodes are during austral causes and impacts of such cold episodes. The main goal of this study is thus to characterize cold episodes in the MB and assess their large-scale circulation and teleconnections over South America (SA) during austral summer. To identify cold events in the MB daily minimum temperature (Tmin) for the period 1958-2014 from Huayao station, located within the MB was used. A cold episode is defined when daily minimum temperature drops below its 10-percentile for at least Additionally, to study the sensitivity between physical mechanisms associated with cold episodes and temperature, episodes events cloud cover and rainfall over SA associated with these events. Weak and strong cold episodes in the MB are mainly associated with a weakening of the Bolivian High-Nordeste Low system by tropical-extratropical interactions. Both types of cold episodes are associated wind anomalies at mid- and upper-tropospheric levels aloft which the influx of humid air masses from the lowlands to the east and hence limit the development of cloud cover (e.g., positive OLR MB).

[The Influence of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (mjo) on Extreme Central and Southern Peruvian Andes](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.A23D0337H) Heidinger, H.; Jones, C.; Carvalho, L. V. is important for the Andean region because of the large contribution of these events to the seasonal totals and consequent impacts on water resources for agriculture, water consumption, industry and hydropower generation, as well as the occurrence of floods and landslides. Over Central (CSPA), rainfall exceeding the 90th percentile contributed rainfall. Additionally, precipitation Madden-Julian Oscillation moist convection in the tropics and the of extreme weather events worldwide. Mechanisms explaining the relationships between the MJO and precipitation in the Peruvian Andes have not been properly described yet. The present study examines the relationships between the activity and phases of the MJO and the occurrence of extreme rainfall over the CSPA. We found that the frequency of extreme rainfall events increase in the CSPA when the MJO is active. MJO phases 5, 6 and 7 contribute to the overall occurrence of extreme rainfall events over Amazon basin are slightly more sensitive to phases 2, 3 and 4; the frequency of extremes in stations in the Pacific increases in phases 5, 6 and 7 whereas phase 2, 3 and 7 modulates extreme precipitation the the increase in extreme rainfall events in the Peruvian Andes is the intensification of the easterly moisture flux Wolfe, To information concerning pre-Colonial metallurgy in South America has largely been limited to the archaeological record of artifacts. Here, we reconstruct a millennium of smelting activity in with smelting from the Morococha mining region in the central Peruvian Andes. The earliest evidence for metallurgy occurs ca. 1000 A.D., coinciding with the fall of the Wari Empire and decentralization of local populations. Smelting during this Pb. A subsequent switch to silver metallurgy under Inca control (ca. 1450 to conquest, 1533 A.D.) is indicated which targeted silver extraction.

The age model for the core is based on a combination of 210Pb and AMS 14C ages from charcoal; modern treated repeated pipette withdrawal. The Peru and Bolivia, are especially sensitive to changes in regional moisture balance.

It is reasonable to assume that the HPLC techniques assist particularly prone to generating large earthquakes due to its wide lateral extension. In order to understand where, and possibly when, large earthquakes will occur, interseismic deformation observation is a to map asperities that accumulate stress on the plate interface. South American subduction is one of the longest worldwide, running all along the west coast of the continent. Combined with the relatively fast convergence rate between the Nazca plate and the South American continent, Chile and Peru experience regularly M>7.5 earthquakes. In this study, we focused on the Peruvian subduction margin and more precisely on the Central segment containing Lima where the seismic risk is the highest in the country due the large population that lives in the Peruvian capital. On the Central segment (10\u00b0S and 15\u00b0S), we used as data to map coupling along the subduction interface. GPS data come from the Peruvian GPS network and InSAR data are from the Envisat satellite. We selected two tracks covering the central segment (including Lima) and with enough SAR image acquisitions between 2003 and 2010 to get a robust deformation estimation. GPS and InSAR data show a consistent tectonic signal with a maximum of surface displacement by the coast: the maximum horizontal velocities from GPS is about 20 mm and InSAR finds 12-13 mm in the LOS reveals lateral variations along the coast: maximum is measured around Lima (11\u00b0S) and fades on either side.

We project that the recent rapid proliferation of hydrocarbon zones will lead to a second exploration boom, characterized by over 20 000 km of new seismic testing and construction of over 180 new exploratory wells in remote, intact, and sensitive forest areas. As the Peruvian Amazon oil frontier rapidly expands, we conclude that a debate in order to avoid the major environmental impacts associated with the first exploration boom of the 1970s and to minimize the social conflict that recently led to deadly encounters between indigenous protesters and government forces.

El objetivo de este estudio fue determinar el valor del paisaje en la selva baja caducifolia (SBC de la cuenca baja del r\u00edo Papagayo, Guerrero, M\u00e9xico. Se realiz\u00f3 una clasificaci\u00f3n jer\u00e1rquica de paisajes y se aplic\u00f3 un \u00edndice de valor del paisaje basado en cuatro indicadores: sensibilidad de laderas, fragmentaci\u00f3n, calidad visual y significado social. Los resultados indican que el \u00e1rea est\u00e1 constituida por tres sistemas de paisajes -monta\u00f1as, lomer\u00edos y llanura aluvial- definidos por cambios morfo-litol\u00f3gicos y bioclim\u00e1ticos; 17 subsistemas de paisajes y 16 paisajes elementales, definidos por los tipos de vegetaci\u00f3n, usos de suelo y niveles de perturbaci\u00f3n. El valor del paisaje fue heterog\u00e9neo, aunque tiende a ser mayor en los subsistemas monta\u00f1osos de selvas y bosques, debido a que son m\u00e1s inaccesibles, por lo que el significado social y los niveles de perturbaci\u00f3n y fragmentaci\u00f3n se reducen. En contraste, los subsistemas de lomer\u00edos con selva baja caducifolia tienen alto significado social debido a la cercan\u00eda y accesibilidad, lo cual favorece la intensificaci\u00f3n de los usos del suelo, el incremento de la fragmentaci\u00f3n y la ca\u00edda de la calidad visual y del valor natural del paisaje. Si bien, la vegetaci\u00f3n secundaria de la SBC (acahual ha sido valorada por su importancia en los mecanismos de regeneraci\u00f3n de las selvas, en este caso obtuvo un valor reducido debido a la intensidad en el manejo de recursos, tanto en el pastoreo, como en la extracci\u00f3n de le\u00f1a y la producci\u00f3n de carb\u00f3n.

Here we investigate such events over the Mantaro basin (MB) located at (10\u00b0S-13\u00b0S; 73\u00b0W-76\u00b0W) in the central Peruvian and Northeastern Brazil located at (9\u00b0S-15\u00b0S; 39\u00b0W-46\u00b0W). Occasional dry spells can observed in both areas during the austral summer season. The main goal of this study is to investigate potential teleconnections between extreme rainfall events in MB and NEB during austral summer. We define wet (dry) spells as periods that last for at least 3 (5) consecutive days with rainfall above (below) (30) percentile. To identify the ocurrence of these events, we used daily accumulated rainfall data from 14 climate stations located in the Mantaro basin for the period 1965 to 2002. In NEB we defined a rainfall index which is based on average daily gridded rainfall data within the region for the same period. Dry (wet spells) in the MB are associated with positive (negative) OLR anomalies which extend over much of the tropical Andes, indicating the large-scale nature of these events.

All papers published in the ISI database (Clinical Medicine collection) were included during 2000 to 2009 with at least one author with a Peruvian affiliation. The publication trend, address of corresponding author, type of article, institution, city (only for Peru), and country were evaluated. The collaborative networks were analized using the Pajek\u00ae software. 1210 papers were found, increasing from 61 in 2000 to 200 in 2009 (average of 121 articles/year). 30.4% articles included a corresponding author from a Peruvian institution. The average of authors per article was 8.3. Original collaborate with Peru are: England (12.9%), and Brazil (8.0%).

Se trabaj\u00f3 con seis unidades de paisaje, las cuales fueron delimitadas con la participaci\u00f3n de habitantes de las comunidades y con una revisi\u00f3n de literatura. Para identificar los servicios que perciben las comunidades de la selva, se utilizaron entrevistas abiertas y semiestructuradas, observaci\u00f3n participante, entrevistas a profundidad y talleres comunitarios. Los resultados muestran que los entrevistados identificaron servicios de provisi\u00f3n, de regulaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento, y culturales. En particular, percibieron m\u00e1s servicios ecol\u00f3gicos en las unidades del \"monte alto\" y el \"acahual de 20 a\u00f1os\" o m\u00e1s, mientras que la \"sabana\" fue identificada como la que menos servicios les proporciona.

This is a jungle area located between southern highland regions, and is notorious for the presence of drug-trafficking and the last remnants of Shining Path guerrillas. As a result, it occupies a central place in security policies in Peru, and has been \"demonized\" in the national imaginary. This article explores the current situation, recent important collectives of the VRAEM, based on short-term fieldwork undertaken in the VRAEM in March 2008, and long-term research conducted in Ayacucho in 2008-2009; and it is contextualized in relation to the literature on coca producing areas and drug policies. The negative image of the VRAEM started in the context of the 1980s-1990s coca boom and Peruvian armed conflict. State policies in the area since then have been mainly based on militarization and repression, contributing to maintain that negative image, which differs of a complex and nuanced local reality. A coca eradication campaign started in 2014, bringing major changes. The negative image of the VRAEM is largely unfair, and has been inefficient pernicious state policies in the area, and to criminalize local people. There is an urgent need for fieldwork-based studies in the area to counteract those negative stereotypes and monitor current events.

One of the most popular general cognitive screening tools is the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE), which has been adapted and validated in multiple languages and populations. To assess the usefulness of the Peruvian version of the ACE in patients with dementia. Healthy controls, patients Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) were assessed with the Peruvian version of the ACE, the ADAScog to determine dementia severity, and a complete neuropsychological battery. The Peruvian version of the ACE showed very good internal consistency, strong concurrent validity significant ACE total score and both the MMSE and ADAScog. The ACE was able to differentiate Using a cut-off score of 86 (out of 100), the ACE was exhibited a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%.

A framework is proposed for analysing fishfood (fish products for direct human consumption) supply chains with local or international scopes. It combines a material flow model (including an fates of landed fish) and future exploitation scenarios. The Peruvian anchoveta fishery is the starting point for various local and global supply chains, especially via reduction of anchoveta into fishmeal and oil, used worldwide as a key input in livestock and fish feeds. The Peruvian anchoveta supply chains are described, and the proposed methodology is used to model them. Three scenarios were explored: status quo of fish exploitation (Scenario 1), increase in anchoveta landings for food (Scenario 2), and radical decrease in total anchoveta landings to allow other fish stocks to prosper (Scenario 3). It was found that Scenario 2 provided the best balance of sustainability improvements but further is recommended.

Emigration has become massive over the past two decades, and the Peruvian populations of the United States, Japan, and Spain have tripled in less than a decade. A survey of households in five localities, three urban and two rural, in and around Lima helps to reveal the special character of this to target a wider variety of destinations. Moreover, it is a multiclass phenomenon. The economic, political, and social crisis brought about by a change in the economic model, two decades of terrorism, and a succession of failed democratic administrations has affected the society as a whole, and international migration seems to operate as an escape valve.

However, due to the sheer magnitude and exceptionality of the Amazon River, research regarding the morphodynamic processes that shape and define the river has been difficult. Consequently, current research has not completely understood the planform dynamics of some portions of this river that present a main channel and secondary channels known as \"anabranching structures\". The purpose of was to gain an understanding of the geomorphology of the upper sinuosity, as well as island count, area, and shape. With this data, the morphodynamics of the Peruvian Amazon, especially the relationship between the channel and its secondary channels in each \"anabranching structure\" along the according correlations found between various metrics. This analysis was carried out for 5-year time spans over a period of 25 years. Preliminary results showed that the average migration rate versus channel bend radius envelope peak is lower for the secondary channels than for the main channel. However, the maximum migration rate was not always found in the main channel; for several structures, the most dynamic channels were the a certain the river's patterns that could be related to the valley boundaries, the local channel sinuosity or geological formations in the study area.

This is not the case for many other countries, such as Bolivia and Peru. In Bolivia and Peru, the organization of measurements, quality of measurement equipment, equipment maintenance, training of staff and data management are fundamentally different compared to the western standard. The data needs special attention, because many problems are not detected by standard quality control procedures. Information about the weather stations, best achieved by station visits, is very beneficial. If the cause of the problem is known, some of the data may be corrected. In this study, cases of typical problems and measurement errors will be demonstrated. homogenization (up to subdaily scale) has been completed in recent years. However, data sets of the quality of western station networks have been used, and little is known about the performance of homogenization methods on data sets from countries such as Bolivia and Peru.

Its performance is tested on Peruvian-like data that has been sourced from Swiss stations (similar station density and metadata availability). The Swiss station network is a suitable test bed, because climate gradients are strong and the terrain is complex, as is also found in the Central Andes. On the other hand, the Swiss station network is dense, and long time series and extensive metadata are available.

The HRV mechanism combines the merchant and regulatory grids. This mechanism gives incentives for efficient investment in expansion of the network by rebalancing over time the fixed and variable charges of a two-part tariff in the framework of a wholesale electricity market with locational pricing. The expansion of the network is carried out through the sale of Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) for the congested lines. The mechanism is weights and linear cost of expansion of transmission capacity, it is shown that prices converge to lower price levels as a of transmission capacity.

Fish was the primary animal food at the site whereas plant foods consisted of a mixture of cultivated resources (squashes, beans, peppers, and jicama) with an additional reliance on fruits (guava, lucuma, and pacae). Wild plants, especially cat-tail, also may have accounted for a substantial part of the diet. Cotton was a chief crop, used in making fishing tackle and the textiles that served as clothing and items of high value and status. As an example of the beginnings of civilization, El Para\u00edso is a case in which impressive architecture was built on a relatively simple subsistence economy and energy was expended in the production of resources useful in local and regional exchange systems.

To date, most studies of obesity and overweight in Peru are focused on adults, with few of them involving children, a population at a critical stage of development. The trend in overweight and obesity prevalence in Peruvian children under the age of five has not yet been determined. Thus, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence rates of overweight and obesity between 2010 and 2015 in children under the age of five, stratified by geographical areas in Peru. Data were obtained from the Nutritional Status Information System of Peru. The total number of children evaluated was 14,155,914. For the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the program Geo Da 1.8\u00ae was used to ascertain the spatial distribution of prevalence rates and was mapped for children under five. To assess the degree of spatial dependence, exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using the Moran's I statistic and was assessed with the Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) analysis to identify geographic concentrations of high and low of obesity and overweight levels. Between 2010 and 2015, the found in 2014 and 2013, respectively. During these years, we observed obesity in located on the coast. Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for both overweight departments the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity were concentrated in Lima, Callao, Ica, Moquegua and Tacna. The lowest were found in Loreto, Cusco and San Martin. The decrease in obesity and the stabilisation of overweight diseases their on obesity. We aimed to assess this association in Peruvian women using data from a nationally representative survey. We used data from Peru's Demographic and Health Survey, 2012. Parity was defined as the number of children ever born to a woman. We defined overweight as having a body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ) of 25.0 to 29.9 and obesity as Generalized models were used to evaluate the association between parity and BMI and BMI categories, by area of residence and age, adjusting for confounders. Data from 16,082 urban women. Mean BMI was 26.0 (standard deviation, 4.6). We found evidence of an association between parity and BMI, particularly in younger women; BMI was up to 4 units higher in rural areas and 2 units higher in urban areas. An association between parity and BMI categories was observed in rural areas as a gradient, being highest in younger women. We found a positive association between parity and overweight/obesity. This relationship was stronger in rural areas and among younger mothers. [Diatoms from the Colombian Text Available Amazon is far less studied than the flora of the Brazilian sector of the basin.

Given the expansionist nature of Wari and its military-related iconography and weaponry, it is hypothesized that with greater levels of violence relative to other prehispanic groups in the Andes. It is also hypothesized that differential articulation with the Wari empire (e.g., heartland vs. hinterland groups) affected the frequency and patterning of trauma. Results show that cranial trauma frequency of the three Wari associated with high levels of violence, though it may not have always been related to militarism. The three adult samples show similar cranial trauma (Conchopata = 26%; Beringa = 33%; Real = 31%). This may suggest that differential positioning in the Wari empire had to violence.

The private pension plan has two components: (i the contributions' plan on a monthly basis (annuity, (ii the plan on basis (perpetuity. The document focuses on the relationship size to the contribution and the pension fund returns. The document covers the Peruvian case. [Relevance of future snowfall level height in the Peruvian Andes for glacier loss in the competition for limited hydrological resources already represents a large risk for conflicts. In this context, and within the circumstances of climate change, there is a great interest in estimating the future loss of Peruvian shortwave effects on albedo, in general reduces ablation. For that reason, the height of the upper level of the transition zone between liquid and solid precipitation (snowfall level height) is considered to a critical This snowfall level height linked to the relations between snowfall level heights, glacier extents and climate scenarios have been poorly investigated so far. In our study, we first analyse the snowfall level heights over the Peruvian Cordilleras. Second, we investigate the relationship between the present snowfall level heights and current glacier extents. As a third step, we derive projected changes of snowfall level heights from GCMs for the RCP2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios and use them to roughly estimate the end of XXI century glaciation for the Peruvian Cordilleras. Our results indicate a large difference in future glacier substantially reduced, a significant part of the glaciated area of Peru can be maintained. On the contrary, if mitigation is unsuccessful, most of the glacier mass in Peru will be lost during the 21st century. In both cases, but even more so for the high-emission scenario, adaptation will play a critical role and should focus on improvements in water resource management which is essential on a local to regional scale.

[[Intersectoral experience to bridge the gap between human resources in public health and the technical-operational level for Peruvian Voluntary C\u00e9sar 2016-01-01 There is a gap between human resources and technical-operational education that limits the Peruvian health system's ability to implement public health interventions. The Peruvian Ministry of Health, through the National Health Institute and the Ministry of Defense, implemented a Public Health Training Program addressed to young full-time military servicemen, on the basis of the competency profile of a public health technician. The program consists of seven thematic units given in 390 hours, 200 of which correspond to classroom and field practices. Between July 2014 and December 2015, the program has been carried out in 10 venues of the three armed forces, training and certifying 405 young servicemen. The intervention provides the military service with an additional educational benefit, making it more appealing as a chance for development and opens up a line of work in the public health sector for young people in more remote areas. This experience seeks to increase public health-trained human resources to a technical-operational level. In collaboration with regional governments, graduates are expected to be welcomed and included in the public health system.

The analysis focuses on the city of Pucallpa and the northern part of the Ucayali River and aims to identify the social and economic dynamics underpinning the commercial sexual exploitation of female children and teenagers around the main river port. The study describes the local operating mechanisms of bars and restaurants in the port, the demand for and perceptions of the sexual exploitation of children and teenagers, and the economic logic that it entails. Using a discourse analytic approach, it is argued that this is a business whose profitability is tied to the trade in alcoholic beverages and foods and which responds to a set of family connections and networks.

R. 2017-12-01 Data collected between 1974 and 2016 from snow pits and core samples from two Peruvian ice fields demonstrate the effect of the recent warming over the tropical Andes, augmented by El Ni\u00f1o, on the preservation of the climate record. As the 0\u00b0C isotherm is approaching the summit of the Quelccaya ice cap in the Andes of southern Peru (5,670 meters above sea level (masl)), the distinctive thermal year are attenuated at depth due to melting percolation through the firn. This has become increasingly pronounced over 43 years. In the Andes of northern Peru, the ice field on the col of Nevado Huascar\u00e1n (6050 masl) has retained its elevation. the 2015/2016 El snow on Quelccaya and Huascar\u00e1n was isotopically (18O) enriched and the net sum of accumulation over the previous year (NSA) was below the mean for non-El Ni\u00f1o years, particularly on Quelccaya (up to 64% below the mean) which was more pronounced than the during the comparable 1982/1983 previous 15 years, suggesting that warming from future El Ni\u00f1os may accelerate mass loss on Peruvian glaciers.

Using a the Peruvian Amazon and in a smaller focus area in the Ucayali region. Across the Peruvian Amazon, they show that between 2000 and 2010, new high-yield oil palm plantations replaced forests 72% of the time and accounted for 1.3% of total deforestation, with most expansion occurring after 2006. Guti\u00e9rrez-V\u00e9lez et al went further in the Ucayali region and compared land sources for new high-yield lands production, thus potentially sparing forests. In the Ucayali focus area, expansion of high-yield oil palm did convert less total land area but more forest was cleared than leading to higher land-clearing carbon emissions per production unit (Gibbs et al 2008). Guti\u00e9rrez-V\u00e9lez et al show that higher yields may require less land for production but more forest may be lost in the process, and they emphasize the need for stronger incentives for land sparing.

[The drugs industry and peasant article gives of the cocaine industry and the related violence in the Peruvian Upper Huallaga. It is violent incidents were closely related to the diminishing cocaine industry, but they were also related to the actions of the state security forces. Instead of receiving support from the state's security apparatus, the population mobilized its own forces to fight the violence. As will be argued, the causes of violence in this cocaine enclave are part of a dynamic interaction amongst many factors - an interaction that is influenced by the local context, a partial state vacuum, and the social utility and the economic advantages of violence. One needs to be aware that motivations of those who engage in the violent behaviour can change over time, as underlying power structures are influenced by changes in local conditions.

[Diversity of commercial sex among men and male-born trans 2011-11-01 In Peru, commercial sex involving men and male-born travestis, transgenders and transsexuals (CSMT) is usually represented as a dangerous practice carried out on the streets by people experiencing economic hardship and social exclusion. However, in reality little is known about the complexities of this practice in Peru. This paper presents findings from an ethnographic study of the characteristics, patterns and sociocultural aspects of CSMT in three Peruvian cities. The study included participant observation in sex work venues and interviews with 42 sex workers and 25 key informants. We found that CSMT in Peru takes many forms (some not previously described in the country) and is practised in different places by people from various socioeconomic levels. In many cases, the practice appears linked to ideals of social mobility, migratory experiences and other economic activities. In addition, the increasing use of the Internet and mobile phones has changed patterns of sex work in Peru. We review the implications of these findings for future research and public health interventions.

Our knowledge about including studies different scientific disciplines and developed tools, is constantly growing (White et al., 2001). However, the link between scientific knowledge, its implementation and the results in risk governance, in general, has increased significantly during the last years (Verweiy and Thompson, 2006). Therefore, the key research question is how risk assessment is implemented and what is the potential for the implementation of a multi-risk approach in different governance systems across Europe. More precisely, how do the characteristics of risk governance, such as the degree of implementation of a multi-risk approach.

[High-yield oil palm expansion spares land at the expense of forests in the Peruvian production. Using satellite we assessed the area deforested by industrial-scale high-yield oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon from 2000 to 2010, finding that 72% of new plantations expanded into forested areas. In a focus area in the Ucayali region, we assessed deforestation for plantations accounted for most expansion overall (80%), but only 30% of their expansion involved forest conversion, contrasting with 75% for high-yield expansion. High-yield expansion minimized the total area required important but insufficient strategy to reduce pressure on forests.

We have investigated hydrocarbon pollution in or fishing grounds by local indigenous inhabitants. The study was conducted in one of the most productive oil blocks in Peru, located in the headwaters of the Amazon river. Soils and river sediments, in the vicinity of oil extraction and processing infrastructure, contained an oil pollution signature by the occurrence of hopanes and steranes. Given the lack of any other significant source of oil pollution in the region, the sources of hydrocarbons are likely to be the activities of the oil industry in the oil block, from voluntary discharges or accidental spills. in sites far removed from any oil infrastructure in the oil block. Our findings suggest that wildlife and indigenous populations in this region of the Amazon are exposed to the ingestion of oil sediments. the local spillage of oil and produced waters in the water courses in the Corrientes and Pastaza basins could have eventually reached the for the Central Andes permits a good understanding of the overall spatial and temporal variations of rotations.

These Neogene rotations are Sub-Andean zone and sinistral strike-slip faulting along the eastern edge of the northern Altiplano. We interpret the rotation pattern along the southern Peru and north Chile forearc as a result of strong late Eocene- late Oligocene bending of the Central Andes associated with shortening gradients along the Eastern Cordillera associated both with the Abancay deflection and the Arica bend.

The famous antimalarial drug entered the European medical market around 1640, yet it took decades before the bark was firmly established in pharmaceutical practice. This article argues that the history of Peruvian bark can only be understood as the interplay of its trajectories in science, commerce, and society. Modern research has mostly focused on the first of these, largely due to the abundance of medico-historical data. While appreciating these findings, this article to integrate the medical trajectory in a richer narrative, by drawing particular attention to the acculturation of the bark in commerce and society. Although the evidence we have for these two trajectories is still sketchy and disproportionate, it can nevertheless help us to make sense of sources that have not yet been an obvious focus of research. Starting from an apparently isolated occurrence of the drug in a letter, this article focuses on Paris as the location where medical and public appreciation of the bark took shape, by exploring several contexts knowledge circulation and medical practice there. These contexts provide a new window on the early circulation of knowledge of the bark, at a time when its eventual acceptance was by no means certain. \u00a9 The Author 2016.

Amazon. from total RNA specific amplified DNA product was for worldwide public health problem. There are few studies in Latin America, especially in primary care settings. Our objective was to determine the prevalence, stages, and associated factors of CKD in primary care setting. We did a retrospective secondary analysis of a database from the Diabetes and Hypertension Primary Care Center of the Peruvian Social Security System (EsSalud) in Lima, Peru. We defined CKD as the presence of eGFR 30 mg/day in models; these factors included age, gender, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hypertension (HTN), body mass index (BMI), and uric acid. described as crude patients HTN DM2; with and 23.9% (95% CI 19.4 - 28.4) in patients with DM2. The most common stages were 1 and 2 with 41.5% and 48%, respectively. Factors associated with CKD in the adjusted analysis were: age in years (PR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04), 3.90, 95% CI 1.54 - 9.88), and uric acid from 5 to DM2, higher continental margins favor the release of phosphorus (P) from the sediments to the water column, enhancing primary productivity and the maintenance or expansion of low-oxygen waters. A comprehensive field program in the Peruvian OMZ was undertaken to identify the sources of benthic P at six stations, including the analysis of particles from the water column, surface sediments, and measurements. fraction solid-phase P was bound as particulate inorganic P (PIP) both in the water column and sediments. Sedimentary PIP increased with particulate organic P (POP). The ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to POP exceeded the Redfield ratio both in the water column (202 \u00b1 29) and in surface sediments (303 \u00b1 77). However, the POC to total particulate P (TPP = POP + PIP) ratio was close to Redfield in the water column (103 \u00b1 9) and in sediment samples (102 \u00b1 15). This suggests that the relative of POC and and that the sediments underlying the anoxic waters on the Peru margin in P compared to Redfield.

The site is located in an area which has been occupied by the Chachapoya, a pre-Incan people, from about 800AD on. The site comprises a large funerary place with several mausoleums built in the cliffs next to the Laguna de los Condores. More than 200 human mummies and funerary bone-bundles together with numerous grave artefacts have been found there. Although the site has been ascribed to the Chachapoya, the mummification method used is very similar to the one applied by the Inca. As part of an ongoing multidisciplinary project to explore the history of this site and of the Chachapoya people, twenty-seven (27) 14 C-AMS age funerary bone bundle plus associated grave artefacts were dated. The 14 C data show that the site originates from the Chachapoya pre-Inca period and that in addition, it was used as a funerary place may have changed their burial tradition due to the colonization by the Inca [Description two Enterococcus strains (Sweden)](https://doaj.org/search#.V6PA8bgrK70) Aguilar Galvez A. 2009-01-01 Full Text Available The aim of this work was to isolate and to characterize strains of lactic acid observed after organic of proteinic nature of antimicrobial for the twenty LAB of the CFS. with from Peruvian Altiplano.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25731969) Moya, for reasoning about groups. This is partly justified the phenomena's co-occurrence in correlational studies. Here argue as functionally independent that arose in response to selection pressures throughout human evolution. As such, different mechanisms may be triggered by different group boundaries within a single society. We illustrate this functionalist framework using ethnographic work from the Quechua-Aymara language boundary in the Peruvian Altiplano. We show that different group boundaries motivate different ethnic focus processes. [Overweight is associated serum than in levels of leptin and insulin are associated with the lower blood pressure in women of Peruvian Indian heritage compared with Caucasian women. A total of 181 women from Peru and 85 from Sweden, aged 20 to 60 years, with normal plasma glucose levels participated in the study. Measurements of anthropometry, blood and blood tests were performed after overnight fasting. Compared with women from Ume\u00e5 in Sweden, women from Lima, Peru had higher body mass index (BMI) (26.2 +/- 4.9 v 24.4 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2)), waist circumference (85 +/- 11 v 79 +/- 10 cm), lower systolic blood pressure (99 +/- 15 v 114 +/- 14 mm; P <.001) and diastolic blood pressure (67 +/- 7 v 74 +/- 10 mm; P <.001). In addition, they had a reduction of the ratio of plasma leptin to BMI (0.52 +/- 0.22 v 0.61 +/- 0.36; P <.001), greater plasma insulin (80 +/- 42 v 41 +/- 21 pmol/L), but lower plasma glucose (4.2 +/- 0.5 v 5.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/L; P <.001). Furthermore, the 181 women from Lima had higher plasma triglyceride levels (1.5 +/- 0.8 v 1.3 +/- 0.7; P =.039), but lower plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (1.0 +/- 0.2 v 1.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; P <.001) and total plasma cholesterol (5.0 +/- 1.1 v 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmol/L; P <.001) levels. Plasma leptin correlated with blood pressure and BMI in both populations (P <.001). In multiple regression analysis, BMI, but not log leptin, emerged as the determinant for systolic blood pressure. We concluded that women living in Lima have significant lower blood pressure levels in association with elevated plasma insulin concentrations, but lower plasma leptin values BMI comparison with women from northern Sweden. This may suggest that the concept of metabolic syndrome is different among women with Peruvian Indian heritage in comparison to a Caucasian population.

We analyze the ecological economics of Brazil nut production in the Peruvian region of Madre de Dios where nut extraction occurs on volumes and high seasonality. The size and the remoteness of the NTFP concession determine much of collectors. The fragility of the Brazil nut economy in the region is compounded by volatile market prices and the overall development pressures in Amazonia, which usually involve deforestation. Although the current regulatory mechanisms in nut production in concessions, the income level is seldom high enough to help concession-owners to rise from poverty. financial services provided by the forest-covered Brazil nut concessions could change the picture. Funds for these could come from international instruments like those of carbon emission control or debt for nature swaps. Green marketing could developed indicators needed to optimize those management, policy and trading conditions that best help to preserve the invaluable ecosystem functions and services.

La accesi\u00f3n Tambo Yaguas, obtuvo el rendimiento m\u00e1s bajo con 631 kg/ha de grano seco por hect\u00e1rea, debido principalmente a su susceptibilidad a Rhizoctonia sp. \"Mustia hilachoza\". [Periodismo intercultural: Representaci\u00f3n peruana y boliviana en la prensa chilena Intercultural Journalism: Peruvian and Bolivian Representation in the Chilean Daily Press Alberto Baessolo Stiven 2010-10-01 Full Text Available El presente trabajo estudia los mecanismos por los cuales la prensa masiva genera y representa discursos culturales provenientes de dos de los grupos m\u00e1s pol\u00e9micos que en la actualidad conviven con lo chileno: peruanos y bolivianos. La representaci\u00f3n que hacen los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n sobre las culturas estudiadas incide fuertemente en los imaginarios que crean sus audiencias, lo que demanda una preocupaci\u00f3n por proponer espacios de interacci\u00f3n intercultural tanto en los medios como en otras instituciones sociales, donde los estudios de la comunicaci\u00f3n y el periodismo intercultural se cohesionen para ofrecer alternativas de encuentro y comunicaci\u00f3n entre grupos culturalmente distintos. El objetivo central de esta investigaci\u00f3n es comprender c\u00f3mo, en los procesos de construcci\u00f3n social de la realidad a trav\u00e9s de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n masivos, son representados los \u00abdiscursos de la diferencia\u00bb peruano y boliviano en Chile. La metodolog\u00eda empleada para validar dicha propuesta es la del an\u00e1lisis cr\u00edtico del discurso (ACD aplicado en las noticias de los diarios \u00abLa Cuarta\u00bb y \u00abLas \u00daltimas Noticias\u00bb, pertenecientes a los grupos period\u00edsticos con mayor tiraje en el pa\u00eds: consorcios \u00abCopesa\u00bb y \u00abEl Mercurio\u00bb.

We present recent evidence of the global demand for a single commodity and the ecosystem destruction resulting from commodity extraction, recorded by satellites for one of the most biodiverse areas of the world. We find that since 2003, recent mining deforestation in Madre de Dios, Peru is increasing nonlinearly alongside a constant annual rate of increase in international gold price (18%/yr. We detect the pattern of that gold price is linked with exponential increases in Peruvian national mercury imports (R(2 0.93, p = we predict that mercury imports may more than double for 2011 (500 t/year.
