For example, two one Euro coins dating from 2015. And usage. This is the most important but also the most complex concept. In the blockchain ecosystem, $SAND tokens are fungible. They will always have the same value if they are exchanged with each other. They can be spent to which are nonfungible. Non-Fungible T okens A Non-Fungible Token is NOT fungible. It is a token that represents a unique asset with characteristics that are particular to it be interchanged or replaced by another equivalent token. NFTs can take the form of a digital work, a virtual land, a domain name or even weapons in a video game. NFTs are simply a technological medium that virtually a blockchain. some extent 'NFTs' can be compared with computer files in the sense that their type and usage can be extremely varied. Semi-Fungible T okens Semi-Fungible Tokens, on the other hand, will have a completely different use. Intended to be a widespread consumer product, this token must, nevertheless, retain an identity all of its own. The most popular example to illustrate Semi-Fungible Tokens is that of cinema or concert tickets. Here, for example, each token has information connected to the date, time and type of event. In the case of semifungible assets, it is not the asset but the series that presents unique characteristics.What are NFTs?9 Quarterly NFT party.

However, if we take a step back, we notice that interest has dropped back to the level of September 2021, which was considered the golden age of NFTs at the time. In summary, even if the general enthusiasm around NFTs slowed down a lot in the first half of 2022, it should be kept in mind that overall interest remains much higher than it could have been 12 months earlier. [as a reminder, the graph below presents users for the theme of NFTs. The score from 0 to 100 is a relative scale that gives an idea of the interest of the general public for this theme] We are in a rising tide phase. Even though the current wave is receding, the tide level will still be higher than it was during the last wave.

It is interesting to note that some countries in the Middle East and Africa are starting to appear in the top 20: Lebanon, Nigeria, United Arab Emirates. At the same time, European countries seem to be relatively behind, the first two being the Netherlands and Switzerland in places 17 and 18 in the ranking with a score of only 35. It's a safe bet that geopolitical concerns around the Ukraine have taken precedence over interest in NFTs in Europe. The countries of South East Asia being less directly impacted by the conflict are still of major interest for the subject.

Note that in the context of Gaming, the number of active wallets is not representative of the number of active players. Playing the game Active only. Art Going from $673 to $430 million, the Art segment is one of those that has been the least impacted by the bear market. With nearly 90,000 active wallets and nearly 170,000 sales over the quarter, the volume of activity in the Art segment remains higher than Metaverses The Metaverse experienced an exceptional performance over the period in terms of the volume of dollars traded, mainly thanks to the sale of LAND Utilities A recent buying the 4-digit domain name corresponding to the Ape they own. This number corresponds more or less to the domain name of the Brand carried by their Ape.25 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Distribution of the market by project The market is very largely dominated by the two launched by Yuga (now owned by Yuga Labs) pales in comparison with just $161 million traded over the period. The 4 projects of Yuga Labs weigh for more than $2.5 billion on the whole industry. In other words, Yuga Labs represents just over 30% of the entire NFT market during the 2nd quarter of 2022. We are witnessing a hyper-centralization of activity in these Bear Market times where BlueChips retain most of their value, and where trading is focused on this asset class.Fig. 03 - Market share per project - Q2 2022 26 Quarterly NFT Market Q2 2022 / Back to contents Primary and secondary markets Fig. 04 - Volume of sales and dollars traded. Primary and secondary tends to shrink, dropping from 90% to just under 80% between the first and second quarters of 2022. Similarly, the secondary market, which represented 70% of trades in the first quarter, has now returned to equilibrium and represents only 48% of all sales in the second quarter. This is the first time that we have seen such a development between the two markets from one quarter to the next. Our interpretation is that the liquidity of most market has remained relatively stable in comparison, which brings this balance between the two markets. On the other hand, the re-concentration of the market around BlueChips (see previous page) allows secondary market to retain of volume salesTotal sales USD Primary Market Secondary Market $1 728 413 014 $6 421 347 797 5 267 002 5038 14427 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Fig. 05 - Breakdown of the volume of dollars traded between the primary and secondary markets (Q1 & Q2 2022) Fig. 06 - Breakdown of sales volume between the primary and secondary markets (Q1 & Q2 28 Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents the market maintain between $200 and million traded each we notice that the primary market has considerably decreased and now represents only a tiny part of the weekly volume. It seems pretty clear that given the context, buyers of NFTs are no longer willing to take great risks when buying their assets in the primary market. Sales volume, although declining, remains relatively high, peaking at over 600,000 sales in the primary market in early June. In general, the weekly volume of sales on the primary market has very rarely been below 200,000 sales per week, which suggests that projects are still issuing assets regularly but for way lower prices.29 Quarterly NFT Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Average NFT price evolution The decline in the value of cryptocurrencies, and more specifically ETH, has had a direct (and unsurprising) impact on the average price of NFTs. Between the end of April and the end of June, Ether experienced a price drop of around 66%, which was reflected in a drop of almost 75% in value for NFTs. This phenomenon can by the speculation observed in the Collectibles segment and by the need of a large number of traders to find liquidity in a more than unstable market.Average NFT price (USD) ETH price (USD) Fig. 07 - Average price of an NFT vs. Average price of Ether -65.8% -73.6%30 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Sellers Buyers Wallets Fig. 08 - Unique buyers, sellers between Q1 and Q2 (weekly basis)Active wallets Going almost 450,000 active wallets per week to less than 200,000, the active community was reduced by 57% between January and June. The number of weekly sellers seems to be stabilizing around 100,000 for 132,000 buyers. At lowest, there is therefore a rate 1.32 buyers for seller. For comparison, this rate was around 1.60 buyers for 1 seller at the beginning of the year. Despite the significant drop in activity, it will be noted that the number of buyers is still higher than that of sellers. 31 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Supply & liquidity The overall volume continues to increase, but at a particularly slower pace in Art, Collectibles and Gaming segments. Gaming is the segment with the weakest growth with an increase in the volume of assets of less than 1% between the beginning and the end of the quarter. Collectibles saw the biggest decline of the quarter, falling from nearly 19% increase to less than 5%. There are still about 8.5 million Collectibles in circulation to date. At the same time, we note that the Metaverse segment has experienced a fairly significant increase in nearly to the launch for OtherSide and its 100,000 plots. Finally, Utilities saw the numbers soar with an increase of more than 40% between the beginning and the end of the quarter.Fig. 09 - Total volume of assets identified by segment reporting32 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Unsurprisingly, we observe an overall slowdown in liquidity in the first 3 segments (Art, Collectibles Gaming), with less than 10% of Supply in circulation over the period. The Metaverses experienced a resurgence with 13% of the supply being traded at least once, while the Utilities remained the segment that performed best over the period with nearly 30% of all the supply in circulation. Once again, this phenomenon is explained by the sudden and massive craze known around Ethereum Name Service Domain Methodological point The volumes presented here correspond to assets that have been sold at least once between two wallets over the period analysed.Fig. 10 - Weekly evolution of the volume of profit and loss when buying / reselling NFTsVolume Report / Who are you? John: I am...? Good question, I am first and foremost an entrepreneur. I like to create things without really knowing how to monetize them, but I like to create them. I began a startup 12 years ago called Food Reporter, then created Bemyapp (also known a hundred customers such as Facebook, Intel, HP and others and we organized events in more than 50 countries. I discovered crypto and blockchain a few years ago. We organized some events around blockchain but I wasn't too into it, I bought Ether back then but didn't really believe in it. And then I discovered NFT s two years ago, and I took a slap! I bought a plot of land in Sandbox to organize events in the metaverse because I thought it was funny... and then I dug in and fell in love with the NFT \"art\" movement. I was lucky enough to witness the birth of a movement and I started collecting like crazy. With my colleague Remi, we created a live show on Clubhouse to invite artists and entrepreneurs on a daily basis a week or two before the Hype Beeple. Basically, it was to explain the NFT s to Remi and it became a daily... and we did about 250 podcasts. In parallel we wrote a book and other things, always with the aim of democratizing NFTs. T o come back to the question, I would say that my goal is to federate. We organized meetups, small events and we embarked on the NFT Factory, always with the objective of bringing more and more people into the NFT s and that the people who are in it can see each other.John Karp, The Non Fungible Conference Organizer John Karp The Non Fungible Conference Organizer, NFT Factory Co-Founder John Karp is a key figure on the French NFT scene and increasingly on the European NFT scene. For those who don't know him yet, John is the man behind the daily NFT Morning podcast, the \"Non meeting NFT presents itself as the European Hub of the NFT industry. We meet with the man who is the standard bearer for and important part of the NFT industry in Europe!`35 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents NonFungible.com: How did you come up with the idea for the Non Fungible Conference? John: It's really the fusion of my two passions: NFT s on the one hand and events on the other. I was in NFT s and I participated in a lot of events around the world but I think I needed to make my interpretation of this world, to share my vision of NFT s. Because there were mostly Bitcoin or DeFi events... which is cool, but it's not the same audience, the same passion. When I said I was in the NFT s, I was told \"oh yeah it's good it's And for me I thought there was a problem. There are many events where I have noticed that most of the speakers have never minted any NFT s. That's how I wanted to make a European event for people who know N F Ts . This is perhaps a somewhat radical positioning because I did not want to discover NFT s but to go to the level above. With a clear spirit to put art and artists at the heart of the processes. In 2021 we saw a lot of evolution, the big brands have put themselves on it, there are metaverses in all directions... but before the \"industry\" side, it's really about putting artists at the center. There are awesome metaverse projects, awesome PFP projects but for this event, it was putting art at the center of attention. Last October, I set up a small team to be able to set up the Non Fungible Conference in Lisbon a few months later.NonFungible.com: What is the NFTs? John: Honestly? There is no could about a technical barrier perhaps, but the main barrier today is psychological. T o answer this problem of psychological barriers today and have mass adoption, it is that the common man hears about it once, twice, four times ... and is interested in it. Everyone, when they hear about NFT s today, thinks \"it's still weird to buy Depending on your mentality, your aversion to innovation or the trend of the world it will take more or less time for you to take an interest in it. So for me the only barrier is a time barrier. The only question is the faster we communicate and communicate strongly, the closer we get to this snowball that will allow adoption. NonFungible.com: How do you see NFTs in the next 5 years? John: In 5 years I think we will use the title \"NFT\" more. In 5 years, in the same way as the internet which is everywhere, NFT s will be everywhere. T oday we use a smartphone, we use a TV, a computer, a whole series of things that depend on the internet without asking ourselves the question of whether the internet is there or not. T o take an older example, it's like electricity. For me we are at that point. These are underlying technologies that make it possible to do a lot of things. You're going to play video games, you won't realize you're activating, using or earning NFT s. You're going to buy skins like that kind of thing you won't realize. You're going to buy goods like works 36 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents of art... and during the transaction you will not realize that you are using an NFT when buying. I don't know if it will be in 5, 7 or 10 years but we are moving towards a society where we will talk more about NFT but it will be just everywhere. NonFungible.com: Let's go back to the NFT Factory, what are its objectives? John: The NFT Factory is anchored in this evangelization process. When I wrote the book NFT Revolution, it was so that my father could appropriate NFT s. The NFT Factory follows this same logic. From the outside you see an art gallery and then behind this very accessible and very simple to understand thing there is all this NFT movement. The goal is that you can come in and go with your first with a little training, a little onboarding, and an understanding of what an NFT is. The goal is really to have a team of about fifty people to have a maximum of referent of this universe. The starting point is that we do not realize how far ahead France and even Europe is on this subject. Sandbox is one of the world leaders in the metaverse. Sorare in entertainment, Ledger in security, other companies that are not yet known, artists who are already known worldwide such as Pascal Boyart, Obvious, Allota Money... In the DeFi there are monsters that are French too.If you project yourself in 5 years precisely, this kind of box will succeed GAFA. If you look at the history of GAFA, these boxes have cheesy HP and IBM who were the leaders in computing. And in my opinion, there are new leaders who will surpass the old leaders. It's boxes, if you want them to work, the whole continent must wake up. Maybe it goes through politicians, maybe through journalists, but it goes mainly through people. If tomorrow in France there are 40M wallets, which buy and exchange NFT s and well behind there is a market that journalists and politicians will follow. The goal is to start at the grassroots and take people from the bottom up to the NFT s. The more collectors, consumers, sensitized people, the more you will accelerate the snowball effect and welcome people into the ecosystem. So the the NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to What is PlayDapp? a dApp with in items to interoperability between different games, metaverses, and even the a to geo- domain Protocol Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Global performance of NFT trading For the first time this year, we observe a clear inversion of the curves between the volume of profit and loss on the resale of NFTs. This trend started on the week of May 09, and continued until the end of the quarter. If the trend settles over the next few weeks and months, it's a safe bet that NFT trading will no longer be a profitable activity at all in the 3rd quarter of 2022. The peak at the end of April is explained by the Presale of OtherSide for OtherDeed somehow slowed down the inversion of the curves. At the lowest, we recorded up to $142 million in weekly losses for the week of June 13, 2022.Fig. 11 - Weekly evolution of the volume of profit and loss when reselling NFTs 40 Quarterly to contents Profit and loss per segment over time If we look in detail at the activity by segment, we notice that the Collectibles segment has been the most affected by the phenomenon on resale. Collectibles are historically the most speculative assets in the industry, so it is not surprising to see very high rates of resales at a loss in a bear market environment. Most of the other segments, although also affected by the current context, seem to stabilizing with just under $10 million weekly losses. The segment that recorded the least loss at the end of the quarter was Utilities, with approximately $800,000 per week.Fig. 12 - Weekly evolution Back to contents The most profitable projects 7 of the 10 most profitable projects are Collectibles projects, for 1 Metaverse and 2 Utilities. It should be noted that the Star project Ape Yacht Club\" with almost $98% profit on resale. Remember that this collection has been the subject of very strong speculation around domain names the Bored Ape Yacht Club number).Fig. 13 - Performance of the top 10 most profitable projects - Q2 Back to contents The most profitable sales of the quarter Of the 5 highest-grossing sales of the quarter, 4 of them are Collectibles for 1 plot of Metaverse. It should also be noted that of these 5 sales, 4 come from projects initiated or now managed by Yuga Labs Yacht observation is that the maximum profit recorded is much lower in this quarter than in the previous quarter: as a reminder, a CryptoPunk had been resold for a total profit of $23 million. This quarter, only 2 sales managed to register a profit above $1 million.Fig. 14 Q2 2022 NFT Project Days to contents Conclusions As we said in the introduction to this report, generating profit in NFT trading has become a particularly complex lately and more specifically since May. The Collectibles segment peaking at more than $100 million per week, but which at the same time still has the most profitable sales of the quarter. Increasingly, we can consider that the Collectibles segment stands out as a separate segment, much more speculative than the others, and therefore to Insofar as do not encumber themselves with their assets over time. On the other hand, this resale rate at a loss also indicates that the players have \"invested\" in NFTs are in a form of feverishness which leads them to resell even in market conditions. We can therefore think this 45 NFT Market Report Q2 2022 Back to contents Breakdown of activity by Number of reporting 46 Quarterly NFT Market Report Q2 2022 / Back to contents Key metrics about Crypto-Art in Q2 (USD)66.4% $4,202,736,361 Total volume assets 67, 2 number of assets identified634,327 Volume of circulating metrics about Blockchain in $1,330,535,811 Total volume Key metrics about Utilities in Q2 situation by segment The Metaverses and Utilities segments have both seen a major increase in their activity in terms of number of sales and volume of dollars traded, which may seem paradoxical for a Bear Market context. In reality, this is explained on one hand by the sale of OtherDeed for OtherSide (the Yuga Labs metaverse) and on the other hand by the sudden craze for 4-digit domain names on Ethereum Name Service. to these two segments, which are doing surprisingly well in this market context, almost all the indicators are down over the period. Gaming and Collectibles still hold a leading position in terms of number of sales and size of communities with 2/3 of the overall market. Art, Metaverses and Utilities share the remaining third. From a profit & loss point of view, there are more resales at a loss than resales at a profit in the Art segment for the first time (around $5M loss recorded over the quarter). The Collectibles largest drop (-16%) with still $265M in profit, but given the trend over the last few weeks, it is a safe bet that this rate will increase and reverse over the next quarter. Finally, in most segments, the average holding period has tended to lengthen Utilities, the two \"performing\" segments of the quarter saw their average holding period drop and remain below 30 days.8Overall Conclusions8 53 Quarterly NFT / Back to contents Overall Conclusions The very least we can say is that the market has changed pretty dramatically over just one quarter! Without doubt for some, the NFT industry has failed their expectations. One year since the industry boomed many promises seem either delayed or non-existent, the world has not relocated to the metaverse, our IDs are not NFTs and not all NFT owners became millionaires, the disappointment is real.. Without doubt the hopes and dreams a booming industry created has impacted many, newcomers especially and this new downward turn has been a reminder to everyone of the volatility of the crypto space as a whole. Nevertheless, as with other crypto bear markets in the past, when the speculation fades the building phase intensifies leading into the next bull run of the future. Bull runs may bring much profit but it is in the bear markets where the real value is built. The NFT industry we see today grew and formulated over the famous Crypto Winter 2018 - 2019.
