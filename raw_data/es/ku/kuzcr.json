These differences make the PCR technique ideal for and genetic this blog post, we'll give you the lowdown on everything you need to know about PCR testing. What does PCR detection look like? Viruses or bacteria have an abnormal complement of DNA or RNA. The nucleic acid sequence formed is the ideal molecular fingerprint that aids in the identification of many viral pathogens. and in clinical samples. Now, let's look at what PCR tests are for and what their advantages are. What are PCR tests for? These tests are primarily used for the early detection of a disease. This is not the case with antibody or antigen tests, as these appear in the blood after a period of time, and not immediately. PCR testing for infectious agents started in the early 2000s and is very accurate for microbial nucleic acids virus (HIV) as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) or the well-known SARs-Covid 2. By recognising and HIV, HBV, Covid infections is generated. In short, these tests detect them much earlier than other screening methods. Today, the incorporation of the PCR technique in laboratories has greatly improved the detection of infections and the number has greatly increased and continues to grow. the performance of is requires specialised staff and is costly, especially for low-resource laboratories, as it involves not issues, but also specific facilities and automated equipment. However, there is a rapid evolution from day to day: more and more results are obtained more quickly and easily, the complexity of the instruments is reduced and more qualified personnel are available. What are the advantages of these tests? As mentioned above, this type of testing has great advantages over other traditional methods. Its specificity tuberculosis, rapid diagnosis is key to limiting the spread of the disease and to promptly prescribe the appropriate treatment. Another advantage is that it can detect most of the currently known infectious agents fluids, tissues, surfaces, etc.). we have a wide PCR detection [catalogue](https://ambar-lab.com/catalogo-de-pruebas/) for the most common infectious pathogens and also for those less prevalent in our society. As we have seen throughout this blog post, the PCR technique is ideal for early detection of infectious diseases. In this way, infections can and treatment can be applied quickly.
