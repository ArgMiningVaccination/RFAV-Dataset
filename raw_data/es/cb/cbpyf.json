Congratulations, you've found your people. NFL.com's \"Around the NFL\" crew (Gregg Rosenthal, Dan Hanzus and Marc Sessler) break down the latest football news, with a dash of mirth. On November 13, 2022, four students from the University of Idaho are brutally stabbed to death in an off-campus house. After a lengthy investigation and cross-country manhunt, a Ph.D. student from a neighboring university is charged with the crimes. As it turns out, the 28-year-old was majoring in criminology, studying the behavior of killers the ones he would later be accused of becoming. Did he use his to become a real-life Dexter? Were the Idaho victims his first, or was a serial killer hiding in the midst? The producers of The Piketon Massacre explore all sides of the shocking crime in pursuit of the truth. A woman reinvestigates the murders that defined her high school years in the 1980s, murders that appear to be happening all over again with a new round of unexplainable, bizarre, and violent deaths. Is it just a stroke of bad luck for this charming small town, or is it a dark curse that refuses to be buried? Inspired by a true story where the coming-of-age drama of John Hughes movies meets the nostalgia-laced chills of Stranger Things. This is THE MURDER YEARS. Over My Dead Body is an anthology series about people who are pushed beyond their limits and do unspeakable things. Season 4: Gone Hunting - When Mike Williams vanishes on a hunting trip, the authorities presume he was eaten by alligators but one woman begins to suspect the true predators may lurk much closer to home.

Season 3: Fox Lake - A small town cop is gunned down in a swamp in the summer of 2015. He quickly became a martyr in the national media, until a dogged investigator uncovered the officer's bizarre and dark past. When truth comes out, the townspeople must reconcile betrayal, corruption and the secrets of an American hero. Season 2: Joe vs. Carole - Joe Exotic is a man who devoted his life to raising and breeding exotic animals, but throughout his career, he's made a lot of enemies. Most notably Carole Baskin.
