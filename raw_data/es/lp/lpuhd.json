As of August 2023, a total of 84.8% of the EU adult population has been vaccinated at least once against the virus. The Commission is supporting Member States in securing access to vaccines to protect individuals, in particular those risk of progression to severe disease. Efforts have also been made to identify and monitor spread of new virus variants. This has been done to assess threats and rapidly develop and produce medicines against these on a large scale when necessary as done with adapted vaccine for omicron. Since end 2021, this role by the Authority (HERA) which also continues to help Member States have access to COVID-19 vaccines they need, either via existing contracts, where possible, or through new joint procurement arrangements should there be a need. The ensuring that safe vaccines reach all corners of EU countries pledged over \u20ac5 billion to COVAX, the vaccines countries, to make available 1.8 of vaccines for 92 low and countries. Figures on vaccination 1.5 billion doses delivered 82.5 of the EU adult population vaccinated updated: 25 August against COVID-19, developed by HIPRA 30 March 2023 - The Commission granted a marketing authorisation as a booster dose for the protein-based COVID-19 vaccine developed by HIPRA, the eighth COVID-19 vaccine authorised in the EU. The follows a positive scientific recommendation from based a thorough assessment of the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the vaccine, and is endorsed by the EU Member States. In line with the Vaccines Strategy proposal of June 2020, the European Commission negotiated intensely to build a diversified at fair prices. Contracts were concluded with 8 promising vaccine developers, securing a portfolio of up to 4.2 billion doses. Deliveries of vaccine doses to European Union countries increased steadily after December 2020. By the summer of 2023, roughly 84.8 % of the EU's adult population had received primary vaccination (one or two doses) against COVID-19. The Commission also negotiated three additional contracts with pharmaceutical companies to secure more COVID-19 vaccines - for young people, for the EU's international partners, for booster shots and to guard against overcome the pandemic. Based on evidence from the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, all vaccines highly protective against hospitalisation, severe disease and death, with an effectiveness in the general population of over 80%. There was a clear link between the level of vaccination and hospitalisation and death rates: the higher the vaccination rate, the lower the risk of being hospitalised or dying. Increasing vaccination rates of all eligible vulnerable and healthcare workers across the EU, was therefore the first priority to control the spread of COVID-19. showed In 2022, in view of the resurgence of COVID-19 infections, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control European Agency recommended a second booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines for people between 60 and 79 years old and people with medical conditions putting them at high risk of severe disease. While the WHO announced on 5 May 2023 that the pandemic no longer constitutes a global health emergency, the EU remains vigilant and continues to ensure vaccination of the vulnerable. To secure enough doses, the Commission also worked closely with the industry to step up vaccine manufacturing capacity in the EU. At the same time, the Commission started work to anticipate and tackle new variants of the virus and to rapidly develop and produce vaccines effective against those HERA anticipates threats and potential health crises, through intelligence gathering and building the necessary response capacities to enable rapid response to health on the coronavirus is thriving.

With the EU Vaccines Strategy, the EU is supporting efforts to accelerate the development and availability of vaccines in a timeframe of than one year most vaccines. The Commission entered into advanced purchase agreements with individual vaccine producers on behalf of the Member States, and secured 4.2 doses of vaccines for European citizens and "}
