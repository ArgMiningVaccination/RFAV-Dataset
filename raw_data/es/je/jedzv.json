When health is an issue, you will be in good hands here. We will listen carefully to your concerns and do our best to help you feel better. Nurturing Life and Wellness health programmes can include lab well also the importance of other health professionals in your healing journey, and as an integrative professional, we may suggest that you also consult with your doctor, specialist, dietitian, physiotherapist or other health professional that can add to the treatment provided by Nurturing Life and Wellness. If you are suffering from a medical condition, and are hurting, do not lose hope, talk to us first. Here Natural Medicine meets Science! Integrative Natural Medicine is a philosophy of healthcare that combines the best of conventional mainstream medical practice with alternative medicine therapies. The conventional medical approach is more disease-oriented and focuses removing managing signs and symptoms of physical illness. For example, if you have a heart condition and diabetes type 2, your doctor will likely be prescribing medication for managing the level of cholesterol in your blood, as well as insulin or other medication to manage the sugar levels in your blood. This treatment is vital to keep you alive and may help you for some time and even for a lifetime. Besides, your Integrative Naturopath and Clinical Nutritionist will boost current treatment by ensuring you're getting the right nutrients and chemical components to strengthen your body. This treatment is additional to the medical treatment you are already receiving which can increase treatment success rates and speed up your recovery. In addition, the Integrative Naturopath will take a holistic approach and become interested in finding the root cause of the problem. In this case, the Integrative Naturopath will do a comprehensive evaluation of your case and suggest some lab tests or image testing to find out what is causing the problem. Also, the Integrative Naturopath will guide you through getting advice from other medical and allied health professionals, as well as alternative medicine professionals that can support you during your healing journey. It is important to note that most doctors have not been trained in Clinical Nutrition, Herbalism and Natural Health therapies, bit resistant to including complementary therapies into practice. However, many doctors are willing to cooperate with a Naturopath when they are approached on a scientific basis to that problem. Here at Nurturing Life and Wellness we are not afraid to write a medical referral when necessary. A holistic professional strongly believes in nature's healing power as well as academic knowledge and ancestral knowledge to help us transform beautiful nature resources into powerful healing tools. A holistic professional understands that health and harmony of the body, mind, and spirit create a higher, richer state of health that would be achieved with attention to just one part, such as physical functioning. It is important to be cautious with 'professionals' that describe themselves as holistic and are at the same time ignorant about science. Science has brought us so many wonderful technologies and allowed the development of treatments, and thanks to science human life expectancy has increased. The term 'holism' refers to a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts and a 'holistic' health professional cannot be holistic excluding scientific knowledge. Similarly, it is also important to notice that many Naturopaths and Nutritionists have enough to recommend diets and complementary treatments. lack of education is dangerous and can impair people's health. When working with a Naturopath or Nutritionist, ensure this person has at least a university Nutrition or Naturopathy qualification. In case you have a severe condition, it is better to work with a professional that has studied more than a bachelor's degree in health and has some experience working in public health. Academic knowledge matters at Nurturing Life and Wellness and we make an effort to translate this knowledge into practice. We also appreciate the role of hospitals and other health institutions in treatment and appreciate the use of vaccination to prevent and control infectious diseases. Our staff is highly educated in New Zealand and overseas universities and has experienced the New Zealand Health Services as a staff member and patient. Finally, the Integrative Naturopath can also help if you have incurable conditions and are at the end of life.
