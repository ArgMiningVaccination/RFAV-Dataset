Researchers from the University of Granada have discovered, for the first time, an allosteric interaction (that is, regulation mechanism or protein, which forms part of the sheath of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the antibody 2F5 (FAB), a potent virus neutralizer. This towards design HIV virus. Although modern antiretroviral therapies have improved enormously the treatment of AIDS, their high cost means that they do not reach the more disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, these treatments do not eliminate it remains dormant, with the danger of resurging if the patient stops the medication. But, after several decades of research, there is still no effective vaccine. The main reason is that HIV manages to \"trick\" our immune system, hiding in it via a wide variability of its proteins, or confusing it through immune responses that turn out to be ineffective in preventing the infection. The study carried out by University of Granada scientists, and recently published in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, falls within the framework of a line of research into new therapeutical immunization techniques that attempt to induce neutralizing antibodies similar to those found, in low levels, in HIV-infected patients. One of these T lymphocytes, due to the virus, since it promotes the fusi\u00f3n between the viral and cellular mibranes. Antibody 2F5 is thus cells from HIV infection. European Consortium The main author of this research, University of Granada Physical Chemistry lecturer, Francisco Conejero Lara, points out that \"one of the main aims of current research into HIV vaccines consists of inducing antibodies similar to 2F5 using an vaccine. To do this, studies into how 2F5 recognises its epitope in gp41 are fundamental, since they can provide the way to designing effective vaccines\". To this end, a wide-spreading European collaboration financed is attempting to design and develop vaccines to combat The is formed by 16 European instituions, including companies, universities, research institutes and hospitals. Their ultimate aim is to develop posible vaccines against HIV. The research group \"Biophysics and Molecular Biology FQM-171\", belonging to the University of Granada's Department of Physical Chemistry and led by the lecturers Pedro Luis Mateo and Francisco Conejero Lara, is the only Spanish group in this consortium and is taking part in the molecular design and the biophysical various vaccine candidates base don protein gp41. titration calorimetry, the epitope. of the gp41 epitope contribute toward the energy of the union with antibody.
