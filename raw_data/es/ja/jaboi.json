Scientific evidence has revealed that healthy diets, including good fats, vitamins, minerals, or polyphenolics, could have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, with antiaging effects. Recent studies demonstrated that vitamin K is a vital cofactor in activating several proteins, which act against age-related syndromes. Thus, vitamin K can carboxylate osteocalcin (a protein capable of transporting and fixing calcium in bone), activate matrix Gla protein (an inhibitor of vascular calcification and cardiovascular events) and carboxylate Gas6 protein (involved in brain physiology and a cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease inhibitor). By improving insulin sensitivity, vitamin K lowers diabetes risk. It also exerts antiproliferative, proapoptotic, autophagic effects and has been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Recent research shows that protein S, another vitamin K-dependent protein, can prevent the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 cases. The reduced activation of protein S due to the pneumonia-induced vitamin K depletion was correlated with higher thrombogenicity and possibly fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our review aimed to present the latest scientific evidence about vitamin K and its role in preventing age-associated diseases and/or improving the effectiveness of medical treatments in mature adults 50 years old.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-06", "cleaned_text": "The Role of Vitamin K in Humans: process, among these factors, These acronyms used this common subtypes in humans are the short-chain MK-4, which (menadione), classified as action against oxidative cellular and death direct species (ROS) uptake [17](#B17-antioxidants-10-00566)]; radical intracellular accumulation [ [18](#B18-antioxidants-10-00566)], and VK is taken up in the small intestine in the presence of dietary fat. A key mediator intestinal other tissues. It can be used unchanged, or it may be metabolized by certain types of microbiota into VK2 or into menadione in the human intestinal cells. A portion of menadione is transformed to all tissues with relatively high levels in the liver and heart but lower levels in the brain, lung and kidney. Compared to MK-4 levels were high in the brain and kidney and low in the liver, heart and lungs. The increased quantities of MK-4 in the brain suggest that this K vitamin is the active form of VK in this region [ [28](#B28-antioxidants-10-00566)]. Growing evidence advocates that MK-4 has a number of biological functions, including cells, controlling the system (CNS), MK-4 controls the activity of proteins the bioavailability food well as high doses of MK-4 were used in the treatment of osteoporosis with no side effects [ [36](#B36-antioxidants-10-00566)]. 2.

Booth et al. assessed spine and hip BMD change in healthy elderly subjects, and after three years of follow-up, the daily PK supplementation did not present any additional benefit to BMD. However, the level of ucOC, associated with fracture in Emaus et al. observed that the daily intake of 360 concentrations of ucOC and a 30% reduction in the risk of hip fracture compared to women with an intake of less than g VK Equally, prevalence of at the hip, and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal [68](#B68-antioxidants-10-00566)]. On supplementation might enhance the efficacy vitD in muscle health, improve bone quality, and reduce fracture risk in osteoporotic patients. On the other hand, vitD enhanced the carboxylation of OC, thus promoting the incorporation of calcium into the bone [71](#B71-antioxidants-10-00566)]. In a group of 181 healthy postmenopausal women, between 50 and 60 years, after 3 years of daily treatment with VK1, in addition to vitD, calcium, magnesium, and zinc, the bone loss of the femoral neck was significantly reduced compared to with calcium may be 45 mg/day a period of one year, had a significant decrease in ucOC and ucOC:tOC However, as no anti-NF-B activity was associated with VK1 in this study, other mechanisms of action may be involved in VK may have a protective 3.
