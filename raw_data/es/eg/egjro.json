Not only is it one of the most commonly quoted motives for Westerners for participating in ayahuasca most elements of an ayahuasca ceremony are aimed to heal and protect. This article is purely ethnographic, and its purpose is to provide insight into the ways healing is conceived by both and Western participants in the context of shamanic tourism in Iquitos, Peru. I show that illness is perceived to have physical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions, and healing is a complex process that takes place in and outside of ceremony. I show that a multitude of elements in a ceremony converge to address all three dimensions of illness, one of the most important ones being the element of personal crisis. Often present in healing narratives, the element of crisis becomes the catalyst including physical, psychological, and as a singular event, healing in this context is seen as a process, in which the patient carries the responsibility for used by numerous indigenous groups of the Upper Amazon, the Orinoco Basin and the Pacific Lowlands of Colombia and Ecuador, has an important role in their medico-religious, artistic and social lives. Its use was later incorporated in healing ceremonies among the mestizo population of Peru, Ecuador and This chapter presents an overview of such uses among as that of contemporary practitioners in the Peruvian Amazon region. After an explanation of the used methodology and Ayahuasca itself, this study presents a personal account of the researcher's experience of an Ayahuasca Medicine Ceremony. Based on an complete participant observation, a \"What is the ritual structure and meaning of an Ayahuasca Medicine Ceremony as experienced in the context of a Western participant in a postmodern society specifically The Netherlands?\" is being Westerners in ayahuasca ceremonies in the Peruvian Amazon, I discuss the ways they make contact with spirits. I particularly focus on the issue of sorcery, illustrating differences in the ways it by and Peruvians. I argue that although it is possible that both populations have the same or very similar experiences with ayahuasca, their subjective interpretations and metanarratives are quite different because of the very different cultural paradigms to which they have been exposed. In the Amazonian cultural framework, local ayahuasca users tend to interpret any negative or attacks, malevolent shamans, members of their community. Western cultural framework leads Westerners to interpret these experiences as part of their own psychic processes. I found, however, this pattern to be challenged, in that Western shamanic apprentices have integrated the concepts of sorcery and shamanic warfare into their worldview. I discovered that, in many ways, a shamanic apprenticeship for a Westerner involves a radical shamanic personal experiences during my fieldwork, which I discuss in this article, own The purpose of this article is to help demystify the beliefs and practices around what is commonly known as shamanism. A series of definitions are explored, with a focus on extrapolating theory from practice. A brief sketch of these plants for spiritual and religious purposes is as old as human history. Some of those cultures were shaman and pagan subcultures; of the Nordic subcultures etc. Some of the psychoactive ingredients of main pur-poses of the practice of these plants were: spiritual healing; to contact with spirits; to contact with the souls of ances-tors; to reach enlightenment (Nirvana or Satori); to become a master shaman, or articles, consumption of psychedelic illusions and hallucinations experienced during \"plant trips\" had a great impact on the and of many figures, characters, creatures, archetype images that exist not only in many as demons, Satan, mythological creatures, gods, goddesses etc. In the Middle East and Anatolia, within many hermetic and pagan religions, Greek and Hellenic cultures psychoactive plant was to configuration religious characters, archetypes, this has the quasi-ethical of \"anti-drug-brain-washed Socie-ties\". Today, it may be perceived as very disturbing for many believers that their belief systems and religious figures are actually just a result of the imaginations of the \"human brain and psyche\", which were very elevated and altered by psychedelic plants that are totally banned today. What those chemicals did in the brain was actually induce the con-sciousness to recognize the inner self, to unravel the subconscious and the collective unconscious, to open some of the of disentangle entoptic images and perhaps explicate some unknown functions of the brain and the human psyche which may have many other means to contact other -hypothetical\u2014 realities! Since the research on the psychedelic nature of the brain will unravel many facts about the consciousness of the brain and human psyche, we invite the authorities again to ponder deeply the banning of the button above.
