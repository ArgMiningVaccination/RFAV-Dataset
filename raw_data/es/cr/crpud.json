To: All Adults in Custody Subject: Flu Vaccinations like to remind all AICs that getting the flu vaccine is safe and easy \u2014and the best way to protect ourselves and others from the flu. The vaccine is especially important this year, with COVID -19 making more people sick. The flu is a serious illness. By getting your annual flu vaccine, you are doing your part to keep yourself and those around you healthy \u2014especially older people, people in congregate care, and those with chronic diseas- es. The flu vaccine is available to all AICs, takes only a few minutes to get, and is safe and effective. It cannot give you the flu. DOC Health Services will provide the vaccine to any AIC interested in receiving it. Each AIC will be called out and asked to accept or decline the shot. It's also important to get the vaccine every year because the flu virus changes from year to year. Each year, the vaccine is updated to target the strains of the virus that are most likely to get us sick. You can also get the flu vaccine at the same time as a COVID -19 vaccine or booster. Para: Todos los adultos bajo custodia Asunto: Vacunas contra la gripe El Departamento Correccional desea recordar a todos los AIC que vacunarse contra la influenza es seguro y f\u00e1cil, y la mejor manera de protegernos a nosotros mismos y a los dem\u00e1s de la influenza. La vacuna es espe- cialmente importante este a\u00f1o, ya que el COVID -19 est\u00e1 enfermando a m\u00e1s personas. La gripe es una enfermedad grave. Al recibir su vacuna anual contra la influenza, est\u00e1 haciendo su parte para mantenerse saludable y mantener saludables a quienes lo rodean, especialmente a las personas mayores, las personas en cuidado colectivo y las personas con enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas. La vacuna contra la influenza est\u00e1 disponible para todos los AIC, toma solo unos minutos y es segura y efec- tiva. No puede darte la gripe. DOC Health Services proporcionar\u00e1 la vacuna a cualquier AIC interesado en rec- ibirla. Se llamar\u00e1 a cada AIC y se le pedir\u00e1 que acepte o rechace el tiro. Tambi\u00e9n es importante vacunarse todos los a\u00f1os porque el virus de la gripe cambia de un a\u00f1o a otro. Cada a\u00f1o, la vacuna se actualiza para atacar las cepas del virus que tienen m\u00e1s probabilidades de enfermarnos. Tambi\u00e9n puede recibir la vacuna contra la influenza al mismo tiempo que una vacuna o un refuerzo contra el COVID -19. Here's what a G.P. Committee member has to say The dictionary defines legacy as something that has come from a predecessor or the past. I do not want to be defined by how I put myself in prison, but rather what I did with myself to change while I was here. The past is the past, it is how we are where we are right this moment. I 've worked very hard over the years and from day one in this program to totally change into a new version of myself. This new version of myself is full of self-confidence, integrity, trust, honesty, and respect. This build is never ending and on -going day in and day out. When I walk out these gates, I want the world to see all this. These things are also very important for my minions to see and learn. This is the work that lies ahead of me in everyday life, how could life get any better than sharing time with family and always doing the right thing for the right reason. So, to my fellow peers take the time to look at yourself and figure out what you want in your life and for your life. It 's all here and its your time, find change a chal- lenge and go after it. What can it hurt to try something new that can lead you to having total control of your life? Remember: you can never go wrong by being grateful.
