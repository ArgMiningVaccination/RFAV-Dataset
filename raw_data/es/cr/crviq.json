Taken together, these that there imaging of them presenting advantages and limitations. a sound basis to combine the different imaging modalities in a hybrid manner to obtain a single multimodal image in cluding the information derived the of advantag es of the others [5]. The physical interaction between the radiation and the specimen involves most times, smittance object with detectors [6]. is the case of optical imaging and nuclear imaging. The image generated follow s then the Lambert-Beer Law Eq. 1.1 where is the intensity of the image detected, the intensity of the radiation source before the interaction, a unit of length and d the distance travelled by the radiation through the object. In the case of nuclear imagin g, the source of radiation is inside the specimen and decays rap idly with time because of the radioactive decay law, so corrections ne ed to be done to account for this 5 circumstance, particularly in the case of positron emitters with very short half-lives. In general, a planar image is obtai ned after detecting the transmitted radiation either with a digital camera in the case of optical imaging, or through a coronal array of used rays and nuclear medicine approaches, was first proposed by Godfrey Hounsfield and plays a fundamental role in nuclear imaging [8]. Since then a variety of reconstruction algorithms have with increasing resolution and magnetic properties of biological nuclei in the sample and how they interact with static and dynamic extern al magnetic resented improved resolution to nuclear medicine and in vivo optical imaging approaches, at the expense of a more limited sensitivi ty. More details on this method are sections. the intrinsic contrast determined by the of exogenous molecular properties, favoring More improved resolution and sensitivity properties with respect to the in biomedi cal imaging [18, 19]. In contrast agents improved performance the potential use as theragnostic drugs. First, I will describe the fundamentals of Magnetic Resonance an d Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Second, I will theragnostic agent. Finally, I will implement the use of single wall and multiwall carbon nanotubes, as molecul ar anisotropy probes able Magnetic Resonance Phenomenon MRI techniques are based on the out standing physical properties of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) phenomenon, as described by Felix Bloch [20] and Edward Mills Purcell [ 21] in 1946. This phenomenon is based on the fact that nuclei inside a electromagnetic a fic frequency, emitting the the the occurs [22, to being excited. Not all nuclei present this phenomenon. It is necessary for the nuclei to have a non-zero spin va lue (an intrinsic quantum property) which leads a absorption, while 18O does not present it. Due to the quantum nature of the spin ( ), the magnetic moment presents only depending on the magnetic quantum number m. So the z component of the magnetic moment of a nucleus is given by: Eq. 1.2 where is the Planck constant divided by 2 (the z component refers to the magnetization vector S along the direction of the static magnetic field B0). If we introduce the nucleus in a magn etic field, the next expression for the energy of this system applies: Eq. 1.3 8 For a two spin state ( ) nucleus like the 1H, the difference in energy between the stationary state and the excited state is given by: Eq. 1.4 And, since the difference in energy between two nuclear states is given by Eq. 1.5 the frequency of the radiation needed excite the nuclei and induce a well as is specific for every nucleus even if placed in the same magnetic field. This characteristic resonance frequency is known as the been the is eventually lost the two magnetic relaxation processes, longitud inal or spin-lattice (T 1) and transversal or spin-spin (T 2) relaxation. The T 1 process (Figure 1.2) determines the 9 relaxation occurring in while the T 2 process (Figure 1.3) determines the magnetic relaxation in the x-y plane. Figure 1.2. Scheme of T 1 relaxation. When the sample is excited with an RF some spins change thei r orientation and energy, resulting onent m agnetization recovers to its original equilibrium value (right) with a time constant T 1. The processes implies surroundings T 1 process) or to other nuclei (spin-spin, T 2). Figure 1.3. Scheme of T 2 relaxation. When the sample magnetiz ation (center). When the off, the transversal magnetization loses coherence progressively and returns its zero Field inhomogeneities may result in additional deph asing of the spins in the x-y plane in a process known as T 2*. In the presence of field inhomogeneities, as it happ ens in biological tissues, T 2* always Magnetic im ages from biological objects by encoding the magnetization of every pixel in the three spatial coordinates x, y and z. This is do ne through the application of field gradients that encode the z and x co ordinates as frequency dependent and the y coordinate as d ependence [1]. Briefly, the three localization of using either field or phase gradients sequ ences is the spin-echo consist of two sequential radiofrequency pulses, the first one is used to exci te the sample while the second one is used to rephase the protons in the x-y plane (these pulses are separated by a time known as echo time TE/2, where TE is the time between the first pulse and the maximal echo signal). The spin-echo sequence is repeated for every value of the phase ding used e next pulse train. 11 Figure 1.4. sequence. pulse train ( /2, , echo) and the lower ones to the slice selection gradient (next to top), the va riable phase encoding gradient (middle) and the readout gradient of the echo (bottom trace). TE is the time between the /2 pulse and the echo and TR is the time between two successive /2 pulses. The different echo signals S obtained in the time domain for every value of the phase gradient (k space), are digitized and transformed bidimensionally into a frequency ma p (the image) using the Fourier Transform theorem: Eq. 1.9 where is the signal intensity in the frequency domain and the signal intensity (microvolts) in the time domain. The signal intensity obtained in every pixel after the Fourier Transformation follows the equation 12 Eq. 1.10 where is the spin density, TE the echo time, TR the repetition time , T 1 the longitudinal relaxation time and T 2 the transversal relaxation time [22]. It is possible to weight the si gnal intensity of the pixel in T 1, T2 or choosing the proper pulsing conditions. Using, very and TR values shorter than T 1, the image is said to be dominated by the T 1 relaxation terms, or \"weighted in T 1\". Using very long TRs (longer than T 1) and TE values in the range of T 2, the image obtained is said to be dominated by the T 2 term, or \"weighted in T Finally, using very long TR values (much longer than 1) and very short TE values (much shorter than T 2), the T 1 and T 2 influences are minimized and the image is said to be weighted in proton density ( ). that permits the measurement light produced in vivo fluorescence or bioluminescence It is a non-invasive then light of a well-known frequency. A usual chemical compound u sed in this technique is luminol which in presence of myeloperoxid ase or one of them injecte d with luminol (left) and the other one without the optical agent (right). Note how inflammatory disease triggers myeloperoxidase the coupled gene is expressed, and emit in clinical imaging was first discovered by Wihelm R\u00f6ntgen at the electron beam as Bremsstrahlung radi ation and has the enough energy to go through biological tissues being more the bones or calcified lesions). So, if the tissue under study is accommodated between the electron beam source and a pho tograph film, images of bones or other 31, 32]. Nuclear development of new nuclear technologies and accelerators permit the manipulation of the energy levels of the nucleus to release radiations of high energy, known as gamma rays. Gamma rays are more energetic than it tissue specificity, emitting gamma pho only from the target tissue. SPECT (Single Photon Emission Co mputed Tomography) was the first most an accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical in a specific tissue (e.g., tumoral tissue). 99mTc 15 emits one photon of 140 keV for each disintegration (the half-life of 99mTc is around 6 hours) which is recoll ected and visualized with a gamma camera distribution of the photons allowing the the In this case, the which are annihilated directions. photons ar e in detector specialized gamma cameras (based frequently on lutetium oxyorthosilicate the photons occurs reconstruction works with the coincidence of the detection to locate the original site of positron emission. but the shorter half-life of the PET radiopharmaceuticals as compared ad ministration.

It is possible to de tect clearly a tumor Contrast of the electromagnetic spectrum able to enhance in the image particular regions of the imaged subject, in which they specific receptor cellular the of lesions and their pathophysiological properties or the response to diameters much smaller than 1 nm [11]. 17 In the nuclear medicine field, a large variety of SPECT or PET tracers haven been proposed, with dominant applications in oncologic variety advantage is the possibility to relatively lo w cost gamma cameras for detection, available in many hospitals and the the SPECT emitters (in the while This limitation is overcome in large through the use of PET probes which offer increase spatial and temporal resolution, at the expense of the more expensive PET equipment and the reduced half-life (i n the min range) of the tissues in analogous manner glucose, degraded resulting in FDG accumulation spectacularly tumors on probably However, since glucose uptake is a universal process, the use of FDG is hampered by its lack of selectivity, to in (up to 30% [41] in the largest magnetic binding sites anchori one the nine chelating sites of the metal, for water contact. The contact between water in the solution or tissue wi th the Gd(III), and the fast exchange of this water molecule with the bulk soluti on, reduces very significantly the relaxation times of the tissue, resulti ng in clearly enhanced image intensity in those regions containi ng the chelate [11]. The use of other lanthanides as Dy(III), may transfo rm the same chelates in T 2 enhancing probes, due to 2 2*. In this I will provide an interesting alternative for this purpose. MRI includes additionally a large ariety or Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer of stabilizing significant increase in the sensivity for MRI detection. This is due to the fact that the cooperative alignment of the magnetic moments from the iron ions the superparamagnetic nanoparticles, in T 2 enhancement, in contrast with the paramagnetic T 1 enhancement, of the Gd(III) chelates. Littl e information exist of these particles [23]. In describe a new nanoparticle coated are limited by the redu ced penetration in tissues of the optical wavelengths, but are well endow ed to image small animals as 20 mice or cells, using the new generation of CCD (Charge Coupled Devices) cameras and optical scanners. Howe ver, the performance of these probes is supported by their excellent selectivity ovided a collection of new tools and formulations that may overcome the limitations of the first generation of contrast agents (Figure 1.7). Basically, the use to combine probes for di fferent imaging modalities in the same vehicle, or even add a therapeutic molecule. Moreover, these novel formulations open era in the contrast agent field, optimizing the and therapeutic potentials by adding a therapeutic ag ent to the same nanotechnological platform, to produce the new generations of \"theragnostic agents\". presents some formulations.

Pharmacokinetics To investigate the in vivo we T 2* weighted the of Swiss CD1 before intravenous administration of Nano tex and at increasing times after its administration (1, 3, 6, 24, 48, 168 h) [71]. The Nanotex nanoparticles were administered intravenously as assessed moved solution in microvasculature, at least during its first passage through each tissue. When the MR imaging plane is reached by the bolus, a decrease in the image intensity is measurable by MRI that is proportional to the concentration of the in jected agent [74]. To investigate tissue and tumoral adult (EPI), ms and TR: 277,51 T 2* bolus implanted C6 glioma 10 seconds after the beginning of the acquisition sequence The kinetics of contrast agent p assage through the imaging plane, approaches a gamma function with an initial portion, a point of maximum intensity and a decre ase until disappearance. The area under this curve represents the cerebral blood volume (CBV; ml/100g) in the imaging plane. The time between the beginning of passage and the maximum concentration is the mean transit time (MTT), a magnitude that measures the time (s) in which half of contrast bolus has passed through the section. Finally, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) is calculated as 31 the CBV/MTT ratio, representing blood flow [(ml/100g)/min] through the investigated cerebral section in of the increment of T2* (r 2*) Due to the high electron density of the iron core of Nanotex, we evaluated CT images were taken with a voltage of 80 kV and a current of 500 A. The exposure time was 220 ms, acquiring 180 projections with a FOV of 57.2 x 57 .2 mm. We obtained an image of X Rays of different concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and original sample) of Nanotex and compared it with that of a commercial CT contrast agent, Ultravist (300 mg / mL, Bayer, DE) dissolved in water, placed closely in parallel wells of a 96 well plate.

Prepara tion and Characterization The study of the magnetic relaxation behaviour constitutes an essential requirement in the in Nanotex suspensions for T 1 (A, C) and T 2 (B, D) at 1.5 Tesla in water (top panels) and serum (bottom panels), in concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.05 mM Fe. Figure 2.1. Magnetic relaxation properties of water in Nanotex suspensions of increasing nanoparticle concentration at 1.5 Tesla. T1 (A, C) and T 2 (B, C) relaxation in water (top) or fetal bovine serum (bottom), in concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.05 mM Fe. Nanotex reduces the values of the different water relaxation times, T 1 or T2 in a concentration dependent manner. As expected for a superparamagnetic is much larger in T 1.The highest concentration tested reduced T 1 water from 3200 ms to 2600 ms, and T 2 from 2500 ms to 600 ms, respectively. . In the case of serum, a reduction of T 1 from 1800 ms to 1600 ms, and T 2 from 1000 ms to 700 ms is observed. The Nanotex effect on T 2 remains higher than in T1, but the magnitude is smaller than that observed in pure water. This may be due either to a reduction in the effective amount of (solvation carbohydrates and ions or to reduction of the free nanoparticle concentration in wat er due to binding to plasma components.

Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD of the pixels from across the capillaries for each condition. Nanotex reduced the T 2 value of water from 300 ms to 220 ms in water and from 159 ms to 133 ms in serum, respectively. T 2* reductions by 34 Nanotex were to 18 ms in water and 10 ms in serum, respectively. Again, the reductions observed in T 2 and T 2*, were smaller in serum than in water, supporting the association of the nanoparticle to serum components in a way that decreases results were commercial contrast agent, Endorem (11.2 mg Fe / mL, Guerbet, under the same conditions (Table 2.1).

The region between 0 and 6 hours is amplified in the insert for improved visu alization of the important in MRI, where its advantages are more evidently proven in comparison with those of the earlier generation of paramagn etic and superparamagnetic nanoparticles. This is addressed 2.3.3.

Nanotex demonstrates a fast transit after remain fi xed in the neovasculature as Resovist and does not adhere, nor tumours, the contrast compared due to the cover which avoid the aggregation of nanoparticles between them and with the capillary.

The body weight evolution was followed in each mouse until the fifth day when the animals were investigated by MRI. For this purpose, mice were injected i.p. with 100 L of Gd(III)DTPA (0.1M) just before coronal T 1 images were acquired from the rectal zone of each mouse.

We investigated additionally a no treatment. Treatments were administered intravenously (unique doses of 100 L) and the growth of the glioblastoma was monitored by MRI obtaining images weighted in T 1 and T 2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging All MRI examinations were performed using a 7 horizontal magnet (16 with a Bruker AVANCE console operated through a Linux platform running Paravision V software. The colon inflammation model was explored with T 1 images using a Multi Slice Multi Echo (MSME) sequence, thickness 1.5 mm, interslice distance 1.5 mm, field of view 3.8 cm.

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy A brief study the the -3 PUFA-EE used became necessary to elucidate the nature of i ts incorporation into the liposomes. To this end we investigated from magnetically protons of the PUFA-EE as specified in well characterized, it became possible to compare membrane structure precludes the observation of most resonances from the fatty acid chains. This is due to insufficient motional averaging in the only resonances from the choline head group at 3.2 ppm and some methylene resonances from the fat ty acyl chains (at 2.9 ppm) are sufficiently mobile ed in the preparation of liposomes containing fatty acids ester (bottom panel), revealing the incorporation of the fatty acid into the liposome, in a sufficiently mobile form to and from liposomes loaded with -3 PUFA-EE (bottom). Note that the spectrum of the liposomal suspensions loaded wi th -3 PUFA-EE is dominated by the resonances from the more mobile lipid droplets from -3 PUFA-EE. In particular, the methyl groups (resonance 1 of Table 3.1), the methylene group to the carbox ylic group (resonance Table and the correspo nding to The these resonances cannot be due to the incorporation of the fatty acid in the liposomal membrane, which would result in an almost complete -3 reveal the acid reveals of 64 if the -3 PUFA-EE goticules are present in the intralumin al space of the liposome, in the extralip osomal space of the suspension, or in the liposomal preparation. to the Einstein\u00b4s principle the ADC proportional to the number mo lecular measurement of ADC is dominated by the contribution of the extraliposomal volume and if go ticules would be present there at a significant proportion, one would exp ect a if goticules located inside the liposomes, no additional obstructions would be found in the extraliposomal volume and very similar ADC\u00b4s would be mea sured in the presenc e and absence of - 3 PUFA-EE.

The relaxivity value r 1 mM-1 for 75 Nanotex encapsulated in li posomes. In the case of r 2, the value of 88.97 s-1 mM-1 for free Nanotex the with water would be expected to be very similar in the free and encapsulated states, since it is determ ined by the magnetic properties of the nanoparticle and its size, tw o aspects are on be expected in r 1. not observed, indicating that the \"out er sphere\" effect is changes relaxivity occurring after liposomal increase, larger than an order of magnitude . The most probable cause of this increase is a restriction in the rotatio nal movement of the nanoparticle in the encapsulated environment. This may be imposed by, either an association to the liposomal membran [108]), reflected predominantly in r 1. Indeed r 1 and r 2 have different determinants and behavior, as 76 explained from the different Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan equations [108-111], it respond differently to encapsulation. Moreover, r 1 and r 2, reflect the different time scales of T 1 (s) and T 2(ms), making easier to understand that the events occurring in the ms range of T 2, may be too fast to be detected in the second range time-scale of T 1. In th notex the nanoparticle, revealing associations to the liposomal me significant amounts of the lipid soluble -3 PUFA-EE in the lumen of liposomes. This can be are observed reveals that the -3 PUFA-EE are present as small, fast tumbling goticules inside the liposomes. This is because the similar -3 PUFA-EE goticules present in water suspensions, filters, while encapsulated -3 goticules, do not pass through the same filters, indicati ng that they are sequestered in the liposomal interior. This finding encapsulated empty liposomal preparations, revealing that the obstructions -EE goticules do not appreciably to the the suspension, dominated the extraliposomal Chron\u00b4s disease, two incurable become therapeutically useful in animal models of DSS intoxication, adding a new, non-toxic formulation to the arsenal of therapeutic methods against these and These effects are due to the combination of Nanotex and the -3 PUFAA-EE since they are induced by empty liposomes or liposomes containing -3 PUFA-EE only. to be elucidated but probably use of a nanotechnological formulation inc luding or more imaging agents and molecule, an this Nanotubes for MRI Chapter 4 provides a systematic study of the magnetic anisotropy properties of Carbon Nanotubes, their molecular determinants and their interest in this respect, since amorphous graphite is known not to be magnetic, while carbon nanotubes are known to depi ct non that 135]. origin their magnetism, their precise magnetic properties and their depend ence on molecular orientation in 82 of carbon nanotubes, remain still poorly characterized.

The manually rotated inside a 7T r T maps (spin-echo sequence, TE=12 ms) were acquired in two orthogonal directions, parallel and perpendicular (Figure 4.1). The T 2 maps were analysed using 91 MyMap Analizer, an in a home written software for image analysis based in MatLab libraries. 4.3. 4.3.1.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) sh owed a decrease in the total metal content from 33% in the commercial preparations of SWCNTs to 20% and 92 8% in the preparations oxidized for 24 or 48h, respectively after oxidation during 24 (B) and 48 h (C). The met al granules of the samples are before and after oxidation during 24 and 48 hours and their shows a decrease in the content of metal contamina nts with the oxidation time of the SWCNTs preparations (E).

Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured at 5 K and angles of = 0 degrees and = 90 degrees, with respect to the direction of the applied magnetic field, for oriented nanotube liquid orientation, and frozen to 5K where they remained oriented and fixed within the ice matrix. We measured then, virgin curves and hysteres is loops under these conditions and after to the external magnet izations detected were larger than those measured in the perpendicular direction (red circles and red lines) (Figure 4.5 A). The same behavior as observed in SWCNTs preparations and (Figure 4.5 C), although the magnitudes of total magnetization and magnetic susceptibility were different in each case. In the perpendi from 0.14 in ase content (Figure 4.4 D and E), these results suggest that the in crease in magnetic anisotropy 95 of the SWCNTs preparations (Figure 4. 5) is caused by the Increased magnetic reflect in the magnetic the cool down to room temperature until the agarose became a solid gel, entrapping the SWCNTs [136]. We investigated then the anisotropy contributed by soluble Ni ions and by superparamagnetic Ni nanoparticles in the SWCNT suspension. To achieve this, we begun by entrapping a 10 mM NiCl solution (Si gma Aldrich, Alcobendas, Madrid, ES) in solid that a significant difference of average T 2 values is observed in the SWCNTs gel between the two orthog onal orientations, while no difference is detected in with NiCl 2 or Ni nanoparticles. We obtained then MR images at ro om temperature, weighted in the transversal relaxation time (T SWCNTs preparations (Figure 4.9 upper left the Ni 4.9, middle left panels) and of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles gel (Fig ure 4.9, lower left panels) in the 96 parallel and perpendicular directions magnetic field using home-made gels panels) Walled Carbon Nanotube prepar perpendicular to the static magnetic field B 0.

As control we obtained the same T 2 maps from agarose gels devoid of SWCNTs, Ni ions significantly 2 in the paralle l (blue) than in the perpendicular (red) directions, as revealed by the shift to the green in Figure 4.9 (upper left panels) and the panels). Notably, the pure agarose the Ni ion and Ni nanoparticle gels showed the same T 2 values in the parallel and in the perpendicular directions. Taken SWNCNTs For its potential use a contras t agent in MRI, it was necessary to of SWCNTs and roughly null viability in cells exposed to the toxic.

These results sho w that the nanotubes oxidized and with amynopirene bound, constitute a homogenous can be suspended water experiments. 101 Figure 4.9. of MWCNTs alig nment and anisotropy using these preparations. To this end, it was necessary first, to confirm that our MWCNTs present sufficient magnetis m and are able to orient in a magnetic field at room temperature. A light dispersion experiment was designed to investigate the (DMF) was placed inside perm ited us to collect the dispersed light of the sample at a perpendicula r direction to the illumination direction, using crossed polarizers (see Figure set-up). We prepared an electrom agnet with poles on the top and bottom of the quartz cuvette, able to induce a transient or continuous magnetic field through the nanotube suspension, while leaving unperturbed the optical path. We made successive light dispersion measurements in which the photons dispersed by the sample were collected successively in the the turned \"on\" or \"off\" (Figure 4.10). We observed that of the magnetic 102 field induced significant increases in the dispersion while present, switching of counts detected is if in experiment by switching \"on\" continuously the magnetic field. In this case, the co llected counts increased with time, suggesting that the nanotube orientat ion of the sample is not instantaneous and that the number of na notubes oriented parallel to the magnetic field with the time of exposure (Figure 4.11). When the magnetic field counts nanotubes suspended in the sample paral lel to the magnetic field so that the photons dispersed more light in the direction of 103 Figure 4.11. magnetic field \"o n\" or \"off\" continuously. With the magnetic field With the field \"on\" the nanotubes reorient parallel to the magnetic field dispersing more photons to the detector than when the field is off. Anisotropy measurements were also done with the fluorimeter using polarized light. For this experiment two polarizers were accommodated at the exit of the Xe Lamp and in the center of the detector. The 104 orientations of the polarizers were automatically set by the fluorimeter controls. The fluorimeter calculates the anisotropy of a sample by illuminating the with light po larized horizontally and analyzing the intensity of the ligh t in the detector. The anisotropy is calculated using the equation: Eq. 4.1 where IVV is the intensity of the light when both polarizers were in vertical position, IVH with the lamp polarizer vertically and the detector polarizer horizontally and G is the G-factor is just a correction for the polarization given by Eq. 4.2 where IVH is the intensity of the light when the lamp polarizer is oriented horizontally and the detector polarizer is vertically and IHH when both are horizontally. The anisotropy was measured along time in two different conditions, with the magnetic field switched \"on\" and switched \"off\" (Figure 4.13). When the switch the sample becomes more anisotropic, suggesting that the nanotubes parallel 105 Figure 4.13. Light dispersion anisotropy along time in the presence and absence of external magnetic field. Note that the nanotube sample becomes more anisotropic with the magnet field switch on. A similar experiment was performed us ing spectrophotometric detection with bound we measured the absorption spectra of the sample, finding a maximum at 340 nm, corresponding to the aminopyrene ring [144]. The sampl e was then illuminated with polarized light (340 nm). When the magnet field was switched \"on\" and the nanotubes were perpendicular to the polarized the absorbance of step was to fix the MWCNTs with a known direction in a matrix which permits us to measure the sa mple in two different directions in MRI. An agarose gel was chosen again fo r this purpose, keeping it inside a 7 Tesla magnet to fix the nanotubes parallel to the magnetic field direction. To prove that the nanotubes were fixed in that direction we made measurements using the same spectrophotometric set up used to 106 study the nanotubes suspension. In this experiment we accommodated the matrix gel with nanotubes fixed in a known direction and the rotated 3600 suspension in DMF, in the presence (ON) and absence (OFF) of magnetic field orientation. The absorbance increas ed when the magnet field was switched on. The transmittance of light was maximum when the polarization of the light was perpendicular to the na notubes (Figure 4.15 A). The transmittance reaches a minimum when the light is parallel (around 900) and goes to maximum after a rotation of 1800. When the sample was rotated 900 we obtained a specular figure (Fig ure 4.15 B). This is due to the - absorption of the aminopyrene molecule over the nanotube wall which in different properties The aminopyrene is coupled to the nanotube with its 340 nm absorption axis parallel to the nanotube[145]. 107 These results reveal that when the nanotube is parallel to the plane the abso Figure 4.15. a support for longest nanotube axis.

The noise in A and B is different because of the different orientation and inclination of the aga rose gel during the spectrophotometric measurement. 4.3.5. Magnetic Measureme have model fix the nanotubes. It was measured the transversal relaxivity (T 2) of MWCNTs with MRI techniques. T 2 maps of a solid gel of agarose with nanotubes oriented were measured in two different directions, and perpendicular to the ma gnetic T 2 T 2 of in two different directions. We obtained results experiments e two measurements of the sample, parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. 4.4. Discussion Using SWCNTs or MWCNTs preparation s, I have shown that magnetic and optical anisotropy are macro molecular properties which are conserved in these materials even at room temperature. In this sense, magnetopoptical anisotropy of SWCN Ts and MWCNTs add to the large collection of outstanding properties of nanotubes as for molecular reorientation are very low for subnanometric structures as the gadolinium chelates, or averages isotropic manner, at mperature [146]. The behaviour of tubular nanometric structures is and the energy barriers thermal reorientatio an finding since it m ay allow the non-invasive determination of the three dimensional orientation of nanotube from magnetic resonance measurements of the relaxation properties of the surrounding water in different dire ctions or the diffusional behaviour of water as context, on the mo lecular determinants nanotube anisotropy become account for the magnetic anisotropy properties observed in water T 2 by MRI. SQUID measurements reveal that the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy increases with shortening of the nano tubular structures and is not due to the contaminant Ni nanogranules. This indicates that the nanotubes themselves, and their association with the Ni nanogranules, constitute the main determinants of magnetic anisotropy in these preparations. 110 Moreover, the larger magnetic susceptibilities in the in perpendicular detected by SQUID provide the physical basis to interpret the longer water T 2 in the parallel tha n in perpendicular orientations detected by M RI. In MRI, longitudinal (T 1) and transversal (T2) relaxation times are known to increase with the effective magnetic field [22]. effective ma gnetic field on the sample depends then on the static magnetic field provided by the magnet (a constant value) and on the local magnetic field originated by the SWCNTs or MWCNTs ( ). Thus magnetic of the nanotubes and consequently, water T 2 by MRI are higher in the parallel than in the perpendicular orientation. The development [115-122]. have shown here that adequately in binding. stable the development of both. the preparations are non- toxic, as revealed by the in ants anisotropy in ons showed that the anisotropic behavior length structures and may involve additional contributions from Ni suspensions is dominated by the structures, rather than by the co ntribution of free Ni or Ni nanoparticles, with a non-negligib le contribution of Ni+ or Ni nanoparticles bound to or interacting with, the nanotubular structures. We believe these results open ne w avenues for the use of carbon nanotubes as directional contrast agents in MRI, as advanced probes to determine the three dimensional orientat ion of molecular assemblies in vivo and potentially to combine over the same nanoplatform, imaging 112 therapeutic and limitations. This review disclosed that the use of novative these molecules. On these grounds, I pursued the development of a novel superparamagnetic nanoparticle, its formulation as magnetoliposome superparamagnetic MRI. together, these results support further development of the particle, as a contrast agent for det preparation demonstrated considerable antiinflamatory pr investigated the magnetic pr operties of Carbon Nanotubes, both Single Walled and Multi Walled. I characterized the magnetic anisotropy observed in Single Walled Nanotubes as derived from at room temperature. Magnetic Res onance Imaging confirms T 2 relaxation anisotropy for both types of Carbon Nanotubes at room temperature. 5. In summary, I 1973. p. 190-191. 2. Farrell, C., J.D. Wallace, and C.M.
