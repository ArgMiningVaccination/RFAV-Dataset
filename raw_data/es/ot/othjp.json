Monardes published several books of medicine in De Secanda Vena in pleuriti Inter Grecos et Arabes Concordia (1539). De Rosa et partibus eius (1540) is about [roses](/wiki/Rose) and [citrus](/wiki/Citrus) known that Monardes significant and well known work was [Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales](/wiki/Historia_medicinal_de_las_cosas_que_se_traen_de_nuestras_Indias_Occidentales), published in three parts under varying titles (in 1565, 1569 and completed in 1574; unchanged reprint in 1580). This was translated into Latin by [Charles de l'\u00c9cluse](/wiki/Charles_de_l%27%C3%89cluse) and into English by [John Frampton](/wiki/John_Frampton) with Empire](/wiki/Spanish_Empire) in 1493. He was the son of Nicoloso di Monardis, an Italian bookseller, and Ana de Alfaro, who was the daughter of a physician. Nicol\u00e1s Monardes obtained a degree in art in 1530 and then in medicine three years later. After returning from his studies, Monardes began his practice of medicine his hometown Seville in 1533. Monardes later graduated de Henares](/wiki/University_of_Alcal%C3%A1_de_Henares) where he obtained his doctorate in medicine in 1547. He went on to marry Catalina Morales, who was the daughter of Garc\u00eda Perez Morales, a professor of medicine at Seville. This connection to physicians on both sides of his family allowed Monardes to secure a good position in the world of medicine in Seville for the next fifty years. Monardes acquiring this high position in the medical world allowed him to get involved in the publishing of medical works with an emphasis on healing and medicine and trade with the colonies on the other side of the Atlantic. Monardes and Morales had seven children together. While some of Monardes' children were able to travel to the Americas, Monardes himself was not able to accompany his offspring and had to learn about American drugs and herbs at the Seville years after his wife died, Nicol\u00e1s Monardes perished by way [edit](/w/index.php?title=Nicol%C3%A1s_Monardes&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] characteristics of the empirical medicinal ideals of the Atlantic World. From these ideas came a series of books about the [New World](/wiki/New_World) that provided arguments in favor of personal experience. This experiential culture can be illustrated with the events and people connected with Monardes' book, Primera y Segunda y Tercera partes de la [Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales](/wiki/Historia_medicinal_de_las_cosas_que_se_traen_de_nuestras_Indias_Occidentales) que sirven en Medicina. He emphasized observation, testing practices, and realignment of classical traditions in his approach to medicine. While in Seville, he wrote about many of the new medicines and plants coming from the New World. He gathered information about these new herbs from soldiers, merchants, Franciscans, royal officials, and women. Many of Monardes' works were translated to English. In 1577, [John Frampton](/wiki/John_Frampton) published his translation of Monardes' book on impactful expedition of [Francisco Hernandez](/wiki/Francisco_Hern%C3%A1ndez_de_Toledo) to the New World Monardes' inspiration. Some believe to on his expedition. Like many other scientific researchers of the time, his works were commonly discussed and questioned. For counter-poison, II ordered one of his court physicians, Dr Berrnado, to try tobacco on a poisoned dog as an experiment. According to the dog saved. his affinity for the [tobacco](/wiki/Tobacco) plant. His fascination with the herb led him to believe that the crop had an incredible array of antidotal abilities. Monardes is usage can cure over twenty conditions as the common cold and, ironically, on to be time. Many European doctors claimed the herb was essential for cures and for overall health and wellness. A devotee of Juan de Cardenas, echoed \"To seek to tell the virtues and greatness of this holy herb, the ailments which can be cured by it, and have been, the evils from which it has saved thousands would be to go on to infinity...this precious herb is so general a human need not only for the sick but for the healthy.\" With many long-term users [edit](/w/index.php?title=Nicol%C3%A1s_Monardes&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] Monardes' first four publications were written between 1536 and 1545. His first published work, a treatise on pharmacodilosis, was written in 1536. This publication's focal point was on defending the classical medical tradition against the Arab medical tradition. His second publication was written in 1539 in regards to the relationship between blood-letting and cases of pleuritis. A third publication on the medical application of roses and an edition of a medical treatise written by Juan de Avi\u00f1\u00f3n in the fourteenth century, were both written in 1545. After these four, Monardes did not publish another work for twenty years. This twenty-year period was when Monardes' focus shifted to the medicinal products of the Americas. It was this shift that led to his most important work; the [Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales](/wiki/Historia_medicinal_de_las_cosas_que_se_traen_de_nuestras_Indias_Occidentales) que sirven al uso de la medicina, which was published in Seville in three parts. Part I, published in 1565 and dedicated to the [Archbishop of Seville](/wiki/Archbishop_of_Seville), was divided morbus gallicus (syphilis), and Peruvian and elaborates on the medical uses of these products. The success of the first publication in Historia medicinal resulted in many informants who brought Monardes different plants that had the ability to cure a local illness. These informants and their testimonies served as the basis for Part II. Published in 1571 and dedicated to [Philip II](/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain), Part II included the addition of nearly another dozen medicinal products including those that be from animals such as armadillos, sharks, caymans, as well as many others. Part II also includes an extensive study on [tobacco](/wiki/Tobacco) and three chapters elaborating on the uses of sassafras, carlo santo, less significant products and testimonies of informants. Part III of Historia medicinal, published in 1574 along with parts I and II and dedicated to [Pope Gregory XIII](/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII), elaborated more deeply on the usefulness of the products discussed in the first two parts as well as adding a few new ones, most notably the [bezoar stones](/wiki/Bezoar). The complete work was re-issued in 1580 in Seville and was the final edition during Monardes' life. The success of the Historia medicinal is attributed to its timeliness, credibility, the experience of edition of Joyfull Newes of the New-Found Worlde, London, 1596, for record pharmacodilosis - 1539: De Secanda Vena in pleuriti Inter Grecos et Arabes Concordia - 1540: De Rosa et partibus eius - 1565: Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales - 1569: Dos libros, el uno que trata de todas las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales, que sirven al uso de la medicina, y el otro que trata de la piedra bezaar, y de la yerva escuer\u00e7onera.
