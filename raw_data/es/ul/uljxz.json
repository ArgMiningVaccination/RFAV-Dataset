Method: clinical tests randomly done in parallel with an of 122 divided into groups: Massage + Rest (G1), Massage + Reiki (G2) and a Control group without intervention (G3). The Stress Systems list and the Trace State Anxiety Inventory were used to evaluate the groups at the start and after 8 sessions (1 month), during 2015. Results: there were statistical differences (p = 0.000) according to the ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for the stress amongst the groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.014) with a 33% reductions and a Cohen of 0.78. In relation to anxiety-state, there was a reduction in the intervention groups compared with the control group (p < 0.01) with a 21% reduction in group 2 (Cohen of 1.18) and a 16% reduction for group 1 (Cohen of 1.14).

In general, the therapies put pressure on, rub and massage the muscles and other soft tissue in the body. The scientific investigations on massage are preliminary and conflicting, but the studies show benefits in relation to the pain and other associated symptoms. A large part of the evidence suggests that the effects are short term and that the people need to continue having sessions to maintain the benefits that are received66.

J the reduction of stress and anxiety in clients at the Institute for Integrated and Oriental Therapy in Sao Paulo (Brazil). Material and Method There was a clinically controlled test conducted in a random way that was parallel with three study groups: Massage + Rest Group (G1), Massage + Reiki (G2) and a Control Group without treatment (G3). For the Massage + Rest Group (G1) the Anm\u00e1 protocol was applied followed by 10 minutes of rest. The Massage + Reiki group (G2) received the massage protocol and the Reiki treatment. The Control group (G3) did not receive an intervention protocol. The sessions took place two times per week totaling eight sessions in one month of services. To guarantee the uniformity of the treatment offered the team of 11 people were trained by the Institute for Integrated and Oriental Therapy (ITIO). They were students studying massage and they conducted the collection of data that was monitored by the teachers who had experience in these techniques. The population that was studied was made up of volunteers that sought ambulatory care at the ITIO and for military personnel from the IV-Regional Area Command Force in S\u00e3o Paulo and military personnel from the IV COMAR that had holidays booked for the period of the research or who were on sick leave, those that started to use anxiolytics and antidepressants at the commencement of the research, those that stated they felt discomfort during the massage sessions or who had some sort of tissue injury in the areas that were being massaged. In the recruitment phases 141 volunteers on 30 June 2015 were selected, by the team of teachers that were in charge and 13 student collectors from ITIO were used. Of these 141, only 122 were subject to random blocks, from the program called Research Randomizer Quick Tutorial1212. team on Excel spreadsheets and was subsequently analyzed using the program SPSS 19.0. The minimum number of 30 participants for the group was determined by the analysis of the sample (with the power of 80% and a level of confidence of 95%). In addition to the LSS, a questionnaire was used State Anxiety Inventory (IDATE) the standard and has been widely used in different studies for the reduction of anxiety1313. Kaipper MB, Chachamovich E, Hidalgo MP, Torres time, referring to acute and momentary situations. On the other hand, anxiety-trace relates to the individual difference and are generally more stable. It is characterized by a tendency to study. Twenty-one people during the of the study meaning: a loss in the continuity of the treatment (13) and questionnaires that were not responded to (8). Many of the techniques used in massage and in this study, were focused on the Japanese massage Anm\u00e1 which is one of the most popular massage techniques in Japan. The Anm\u00e1 aims to re-balance the energy based on pressure and in specific rubbing thighs down to the feet (for 20 minutes), using the special meridian line from the bladder and small intestine. The sequence includes: pressure with the palm of the hand on the spine (2 times), pressure on the paravertebral (twice), kneading on the paravertebral (twice), kneading from the start of the spine from the scapula to the top angle of the scapula (twice), the on the occipital line (twice), kneading with all fingers on cervical spine (3 times), pressure on the gluteus - 2 lines (twice), kneading on the gluteus - 2 lines (twice), pressure on the front part of the thigh - 2 lines (twice), pressure on the popliteal line (twice), kneading in the supra-carpian region on the sural triceps - (twice), pressure on the incept region of the feet - 3 lines (twice) and kneading on the incept region of the feet - 3 lines (twice). Pressure is placed for approximately one second. Kneading is defined as the carrying out of three circular movements when putting on pressure. With reference to, Reiki this is a complementary health approach in which the users place their hands lightly on or above the person the the to mobilize \"vital universal energy\" that gives support to the innate and natural abilities of the body and mind supplying force, harmony and equilibrium. Its origins go back thousands of years from Tibet and it was established in 1800 by a Japanese monk called Dr. Mikao Usui1515. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. An hands for 2.5 minutes on every position: eyes, occipital region, laryngeal region and on the breastplate on the heart region (during a total of 10 minutes) for the re-equilibrium of the chakras which are important for the mental and emotional state. The data was noted down for the relative frequency and the measurements of central tendencies. The comparison between the groups was done through Pearson's chi-squared test and the qualitative variables and the ANOVA to test the average differences. Also, the Levene used to check the equality. To compare the before after, the ANOVA test was used for repeated measurements and the Tukey test for multiple comparisons. The size of the effect of the interventions was measured through the Cohen d test and the adopted significance level equaled = 5%. The projects theme was Practices improve the quality of life\" to which the present study is connected which was approved by the Ethics Committee on Research in the Nursing form when being recruited to take part. There were no losses or damages due to the study. Results The study finally settled with 101 participants. distribution inter-group (p = 0.738) and in relation to the activities of the professionals there were military personnel (30), health care professionals (15), students (9) and others (47).

Description of the size of the effect (Cohen's d) and the percentage of the change in the evaluation of the LSS and the IDATE and before and after treatment, according to the study groups, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil, 2015 Some physical and psychological symptoms of the LSS responded well to the two intervention groups (p < 0.05) through ANOVA for repeated measures and multiple comparisons of Tukey, as per [Table 4]() as follows. The symptoms that obtained statistical differences for the Intervention Groups (1 and 2) in relation to the Control group (3) were: the feeling that they were about to faint, a lack of energy, no will to do anything, physical exhaustion, headache and an appetite that oscillates. The symptoms that only responded to the and Rest group (1) were: thoughts that caused anxiety, the feeling of wanting to be alone and the feeling of worries.

In a study that explored massage therapy combined with meditation it concluded that the results were better for the massage and meditation groups than when compared with the group that received just massage therapy although there were no statistical differences between both groups. The 40 participants in the study were women in the post-operational phase of a mastectomy after having insomnia, and they referred to relaxation as having given them a better mood and more energy based on the points on the visual analogical scale for each one of the et al. Massage increased by 24% the reduction in the stress levels and 16% for the IDATE-state in relation to the Massage and Rest group it to 33.0% stress and 21.0% for the IDATE-state. One can consider that there only being 10 minutes of Reiki post-massage with positive results when it was used in combination (Massage + Reiki) means that an association of these two energy techniques allowed for a reduction to be had in the time for the application of Reiki. The other studies used approximately 20 to 30 minutes in the Reiki sessions as the only technique. In a study where the sessions were 20 minutes the intervention showed positive effects in the reduction of blood pressure being a complementary technique for the control of hypertension1919.

However, there is a long journey to be made for the scientific community to recognize the effects of Reiki on its own or as a practice that is integrated with other PIC techniques. A systematic review of Reiki leads us to the conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to say that Reiki is an effective treatment after twenty-three random clinical sessions based on the electronic data2323. Lee MS, Pittler MH, Ernst E. Effects of the issue with reference to the effect of Reiki on the levels of cortisol. In a clinical test with health psychology students no significant changes were found in the levels of cortisol after the application of Reiki2424. Bowden D, Goddard L, Gruzelier J. A randomized controlled single-blind trial of the efficacy sessions is not sufficient to immediately reduce the levels of saliva cortisol.

For the next study the placebo could be used where Reiki is not applied. The results provide incentives carry physiological markers of stress and an evaluation of the time of the Reiki sessions so that the findings can be extended to other populations. Conclusion Massage and massage combined with Reiki effective reducing the levels of stress anxiety. associated with Massage + Reiki produced better results on the variables of measurements of intervention than when conducted only as resulted in positive outcomes in relation to the Massage + Reiki intervention physical and emotional in nature spotlighting the all-encompassing effects of Reiki. It is therefore suggested that another study with a placebo group for Reiki should be conducted to evaluate the technique on its own. Also, focus should be placed in the use of physiological measures to better evaluate the effects of the the students, professors and at and Therapy. References - 1Rodgers Hauschulz JL, CR, et al.
