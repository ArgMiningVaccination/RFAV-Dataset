Mercedes D\u00e1vila and I am pleased to present the scientific report 2021-22 of the Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBM), giving an overview of the events and scientific and strategic activities during this period. This will be my last contribution that I write as Director, as on March 2023 Paola Bovolenta has been designated CBM Director, after being elected by the CBM General Board (Claustro Cientifico) and proposed by the Governing Board (Junta de Gobierno). In 2021-2022 we have started to see the fruits of the work carried out in the past few years, thanks to the changes in the scientific organization and the recruitment of promising scientists, young PIs as well as senior consolidated groups, adding their expertise in state-of-the-art technological and scientific approaches. We have seen a significant improvement in research outputs in terms of high-quality well as in fund-raising, relevant EU-funded and national and regional grants focused in the COVID19 pandemics have continued during these two years, adding to the knowledge of the biology of the virus, its airborne detection, immune response the development potential treatment strategies. One of our researchers coordinates CSIC Interdisciplinary Thematic Platform known as Global Health Platform facility has been PCRs for CSIC personnel, in Health closely related development of new vaccines, several CBM researchers have been very active in science dissemination and communication to the lay public in mass media and have received prestigious awards for this activity. Also, in 2022, we launched a specific science communication event with the support of Comunidad de Madrid, \"Ciencia Contigo\", carried out at the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, that was highly successful in terms of the number of attendees and the feedback and comments in social media. We have continued with our strong commitment to training, exemplified by 2021-22, 65 Master Thesis and more than Final Degree Projects carried out supervised by CBM researchers. A total of 147 seminars and conferences by prestigious national and international researchers have taken place in these two years. In 2021 the CBM Equality Working Group was established and, working in close contact with CSIC and UAM Equality Committees, carried out specific dissemination opportunities for activities. result this, CBM Distinction to mention that CBM researchers received different awards in this period, underlying those granted to young researchers, as is the case of the National Research Award \"Gabriela Morreale\", in Medicine and Health Sciences granted to Mar\u00eda Llorens and the \"Margarita Salas Award\" from Comunidad de Madrid granted to Ana Ortega. Finally, thanks to the excellent research outputs, and a very well-defined strategic plan for the next four years, focused on Interplay Ochoa Centre of Excellence in the 2021 Call, with Paola Bovolenta as Scientific Director. This represents an excellent opportunity for the CBM to consolidate a leading position in the Spanish research landscape, which I am confident will be achieved. All the proposed actions and the commitment and excellent work of in scientific and technical services undoubtedly ensure success in this aim. I have had the privilege of serving the CBM as Director for the past four years. I had never anticipated that I would one day be Director when I completed my PhD research in this centre (a too long time ago!). I have always been aware of the scientific excellence of the CBM, but during these years I have had the opportunity to realize the complexity and the impressive efficiency of the scientific, administrative out \"housekeeping\" allow investigators to and attain their scientific objectives. I would like to thank all the many people who have helped me along, each in their own corresponding sphere of activity and responsibility, with special thanks to the Vice-director Jaime Mill\u00e1n. I am grateful to have had this time serving as Director and I am excited with the prospect of continuing to be part of Juan Modolell, ad honorem Professor of Research of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), passed away in Madrid at age 85. Juan was born in Barcelona in 1937. He obtained two bachelor's degrees: in Biological Sciences (Universidad de Barcelona, 1959) and in Biochemistry (Universidad de La Laguna, 1962). He attained a PhD in Biochemistry from Ohio State University in 1966. Afterwards, he made a successful post-doc at Prof. Bernard Davis\u00b4 lab (Harvard Medical School), the inhibition of protein biosynthesis by the antibiotic streptomycin. Juan came back to Spain in 1970 to join the laboratory of Prof. David Vazquez, at the \"Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas\", obtained a second PhD in Chemical Sciences (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 1971) and soon after, became a staff member of the CSIC. In 1977, he moved to the recently founded \"Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa\" (CBMSO) where he has been an active member for the rest of his life. Juan made landmark discoveries in two unrelated fields of in the biosynthesis of proteins field when, it 1980, he made a risky transition to start working in Drosophila Developmental Biology. After a fruitful conversation with Antonio on the analysis of pattern of the pattern of cover the thorax of the adult Drosophila . Juan and his group pioneered the use of Molecular Biology techniques to clone and key role of the patterning of bristle precursors are selected from among the clusters of cells that express achaete/scute. Furthermore, Juan\u00b4 s team demonstrated that the expression genes depends on the activity of enhancer elements, which drive their transcription at precise positions of the wing disc and reinforce it in the neural precursors. Remarkably, these were ones achaete-scute expression acting through those enhancers (the of stablished to the generation of morphological patterns and pave the way to the identification genes in organisms, thus generations of researchers, which he considered his second family, was always eager to receive visiting scientists that benefited from the know-how and the excellent scientific environment of Juan\u00b4s lab at the CBMSO.

FOR INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN GLOBAL HEALTH (PTI SALUD GLOBAL) OF THE SPANISH NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (CSIC), OUTSTATION AT CBMSO The Platform for Interdisciplinary Research in Global Health (PTI Salud Global) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) emerged in March 2020 to initially deal with the SARS coronavirus 2 pandemic and is now conducting research on infectious agents. These include the West Nile virus in Sevilla since 2020 and mpox in 2022. Avian flu and Marburg virus are on watch. This national cluster is a virtual institution that proposes advanced solutions in the short, medium and long term. Margarita Del Val (CBMSO, CSIC-UAM) and I\u00f1aki Comas (IBV, CSIC) are the scientific Coordinators. The Platform comprises more than 400 researchers from 144 research groups from different disciplines, representing the wide range of fields of connecting human health strongly oriented towards transferring knowledge, products, procedures and information to society and industry. +300 research groups working together on specialised solutions within each eld Studies to unravel vaccine for drug repurposing Analysis of bring the future closerThe participating research groups are carrying out projects which cover every facet of the pandemic: origin, prevention, disease, containment measures, treatment, social impact, and the need to communicate with society. The most important achievements of PTI Global Health are delivering short-term and mid-term strategies and measures. These will help society and the healthcare system to better cope with new pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and to mitigate the impact of its progress.The Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the largest research institution in Spain, has created Salud Global/Global Health. An Interdisciplinary Thematic Platform (PTI) to answers and solutions to every facet of the pandemic. This initiative includes many of the most innovative research projects happening right now and is backed nancially by a range of organisations and companies.Scientic disciplines join forces to ght COVID-19 Analysis of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures compared to emergencies and work is to mouthwash that traps the and stops its spread, as well as antimicrobial surfaces and textiles. Articial intelligence is also being used to guide social distancing measures. Containment and protection Quick reliable diagnostic tests been developed to detect immunity (ELISA kit), as well as a radiological screening system based on articial intelligence for the diagnosis of pneumonia, and rapid point-of-care tests.

Our research is aimed such that we use the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that offers the possibility genetic and genomic approaches. to plant development is post-embryonic and during entire life to study cell proliferation, arrest and differentiation. A major advance has been the generation of Arabidopsis (PlaCCI) using these tools to decipher the gene networks and controlling to a root tip (Fig. 1). We have been expanding these studies to other organs and how dividing cells with each other. Expanding project interested in learning new pathways controlling the response to different types of stress in three different avenues. One is the identification of molecular determinants of DNA replication origin (ORI) function. Based on previous maps of and their association with epigenetic marks in 9 chromatin states we are exploring of individual modifications in ORI function using CRISPR-dCas9 tools. Another is the link of DNA replication factors in the deposition and maintenance of epigenetic marks and how they affect the reprogramming of gene expression in growth under normal and stress conditions.

The differential reading of this info is key to generate the diversity of cell types during the developmental program of a complex organism. In this frame, the transcription of DNA into RNA constitutes the first stage of that reading and is of mitosis is fundamental to obtain the precise number of cells to build a whole organism while the establishment of most of the cell lineages required the passage of cells through mitosis. Interestingly, transcription is widely silenced during mitosis due the polymerases understood. How cells remember the transcriptional program of the mother or/and how those programs rewire during development are mostly unknown. In our laboratory we aim to answer these questions using the culture of mammalian cells as a model. One of our goals is to understand the dynamic and recycling of the RNA polymerase 2, the enzyme transcribing all protein coding genes parallel, we the approaches, technology and aim to understand how the transcriptional machinery works across the challenge of mitosis with the hope to understand how gene expression and CBMSO. \u00bbArdehali MB, Perea-Resa C, actively genes Blum BC, Werder Paul M, J, Patten JJ, Villacorta- Martin C, Bolzan D, Perea-Resa C, Bullitt E, Hinds A, Tilston-Lunel A, Varelas X, Farhangmehr S, Braunschweig U, Kwan M, Basu A, Saeed M, Perissi Blower M, Kotton DN, Wilson AA, M\u00fchlberger E, Emili A.

This knowledge is fundamental for basic biology and have enormous implications for cell fate specification in physiology and pathology. To investigate this we combine the application of genomics, epigenomics, epitranscriptomics, molecular biology and imaging we found non-coding RNA retention associates the usage of replication origins upon stress challenges. We found that is the frequency of activation of the same pool of replication origins what is mainly increased upon stress, and that, in unchallenged cells, the frequency of activation correlated with the 3D organization of the origins in the nucleus.

Title: Methods and compositions for the treatment of disorders characterized a KIDINS220 in forming a gradient distribution within a morphogenetic field. Some of these signals (called morphogens) are modified by lipids, which confer making known dispersal. In Drosophila , we have demonstrated that cytonemes are required for the establishment of Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen gradient and that vesicles are the Hh carriers in cytoneme-mediated transport for its secretion. The ability of the receptor cells to respond concentrations at sites of direct contact between cytoneme membranes in a way similar to neuronal synapses. The research of the group is related to the of Hh-receiving signalling complex on (Fig.1). To this aim we the the process of Hh signalling synaptic the pathway the crosstalk between pathways in normal and pathological development. Our research is interdisciplinary; we use diverse experimental systems in a variety of information generated the development of mathematical models for the signalling processes that, in turn, let us explore different hypotheses. communication processes such as the maintenance of adult homeostasis and tumor progression.

We are presently investigating the role of mutations like scribble, erupted or polyhomeotic. Some to this work has already been published (Medina et al 2021). We have also found evidence for a new mechanism interactions between populations, growth normal tissues. This process may provide new hints how normal tissues.Another critical function of the is This research line is being actively investigated in the lab.

The first project involves the analysis of the functional requirements of Drosophila genes in the wing. We grouped the 14.000 Drosophila genes into 16 functional groups (Fig. 1) and screened UAS-RNAi lines targeting 10918 and each mutant phenotype with in wing-specific functions related to its growth and patterning, and together with gene second project is the analysis the transcriptional effects of one Drosophila transcription factor (Spalt) that has a prominent role in the development of the wing disc. Spalt is a nuclear protein containing three pairs of Zn and minimal DNA response element for Spalt through the analysis of the regulatory region of one of its downstream genes and now we are defining the effects of mechanism of action. The third project concerns the Ras gene. Mutations in human Ras are common in multitude of cancers, and the Drosophila Ras gene has carrying altered versions of the fly and human Ras genes. We are characterizing the consequences of activating Ras mutations when the gene is expressed at normal levels in the wing, the ovary lymph gland.

To do this, we search for and identify cis regulatory sequences, and we study how they act on their target genes, how they are organized along the 3D structure of chromatin and their role the bioinformatics analysis structural genomics, genome-wide gene using the functional in transgenic and pluripotent stem cells. We explore this field using a model in which we have demonstrated our experience and to which we have made relevant contributions: the early stages of embryonic development in mammals. We are experts in the study of the initial phases of mouse development from one cell to the blastocyst of barely a hundred. This is an ideal model, where the combination of genetic, pharmacological, and the first differences between cell types that occur in the embryo. In addition, we are pioneers in developing omics we can interrogate gene expression or chromatin structure in individual mouse embryos of just a dozen cells. We extend these studies in the embryo with the use of pluripotent stem cells, as a complementary system in culture in which we have extensive experience. Also, we will fine-tune the use of gastruloids, embryonic organoids, as an experimental system. In addition, we to understand how the progressive loss of capacity of the embryo cells occurs, from the totipotent state present in the zygote to the gastrulation phases of the embryo. We hypothesize that this knowledge also allow us to reprogram networks to initiate regeneration processes in situations of tissue damage. The future of research in our group will be based on the achievements and objectives set out above, with the ultimate goal of answering a basic question: how does the genome act in a coordinated way to give rise to differences between cell types, stages of development, \u00bbAndreu MJ, Alvarez-Franco A, Portela M*, Gimenez- Llorente D, Cuadrado A, Badia-Careaga C, Tiana M, Losada A, Manzanares M (2022).

During 2021-2022, we have tested: a) the presence of tau in non-neuronal cells, b) the presence of new tau isoform and c) we have started to look for a possible specific role of tau in neuronal aging, since aging is the main risk factor for Alzheimer disease. About the presence of tau in non-neuronal cells, we have found that tau could be present in microglia cells, being that presence the consequence of the endocytosis of extracellular (neuronal) tau into microglia cells. Also, we have found that the effect of tau in microglia cells results in the activation of p38 kinase that could be toxic for the cell. In that way, inhibition of p38 this kidney tau, a role in podocyte A new tau isoform raised by intron 12 retention has been tau isoform contains an extra 16aa peptide, only present in humans, tryptophan residues named it as W-Tau isoform. Looking at W-Tau isoform, we have found that it has a low capacity for self-aggregation, unlike (DG) and hippocampal region old mice, since DG is one of the regions that are earlier affected in AD. Previously, we described, in vivo , that the so-called Yamanaka Factors (YF).

Regarding therapies, we have been involved in the development of small chemical drugs targeted to rescue the activity for loss and gain of function mutations in IEM. We have published evidence regarding the possible use of small chemical molecules such as celastrol in combination with pharmacological chaperones the severe rare diseases PMM2-CDG and methylmalonic aciduria, this last with B12. Advancing the development of pharmaco-chaperoning, we have obtained five complete crystal structures of hPMM2 (free and bound to the essential activator glucose- 1,6-bisphosphate), three for the wild type and two for the destabilizing p.Thr237Met variant.

With this goal in mind, the lab focuses on ATG16L1 as a paradigm to discover new unconventional autophagic machinery. in the lysosome. However, ATG16L1 includes a domain that is irrelevant for this activity and seems to play unconventional roles in a wide variety of cellular processes. Projects currently being developed in the in detail novel unconventional functions of ATG16L1 carried out through this domain, and explore how they interact with the conventional pathway. Areas of interest in the lab in the 2021-22 period have focused on the role of identify processes we use a variety of genetically manipulated experimental systems, proteomics and bioinformatics approaches.

DNA transfer and repair is enhanced in thermal environments due to the temperatures against replication fidelity selection of genomes. For Thermus thermophilus (Tth), this selection has leaded to the evolution of a polyploid genome and the most efficient natural competence apparatus (NCA) so far described. In by direct cell process allows the ejection of DNA from with the concomitant incorporation by a competent recipient mate through its NCA. The main focus of our research in the last two years has been the analysis of the mechanisms involved in protection against the integration of environmental DNA in the genome. In this context we studied the role of a DNA primase-polymerase encoded by mobile element as function dramatically the transformability of with orders of magnitude, playing apparently a defensive role that is not active against DNA transferred by a mating pair in transjugation. This differential protective is similar to that relevance for plasmid stability and of ssDNA guides for ThAgo. Our most recent work has shown imbrication keeping an mutants survive to the inactivation of Ppol. Future work of the group will focus on the relation of HGT and recombination pathways and use this knowledge to develop new tools for the directed evolution of proteins in Tth.

Very little is known about conjugation in Gram-positive (G+) bacteria. Despite of its also positive side: modify bacteria that are relevant in industrial, clinical and scientific settings that are reluctant to modification by other methods. The two main objectives in our lab are developing tools to modify G+ bacteria and studying different stages of the conjugation process. The final goal is to use this information generate drugs or strategies to expertise. Bioinformatics plays a crucial role in all our research lines. Recently, we have found that pLS20 is the prototype of a family of related plasmids that can be divided into four clades. Another of our provide community with tools modification G+ regions between strains. Another goal is to gain insights into the different stages of the conjugation process that may lead to ways to impede conjugation-mediated spread of AR. Results obtained in the last years have shown that the scientific significance of our research is much wider than these goals, which is illustrated by the First, studying the regulatory a novel two-component processive antitermination system that is present on almost all operons in G+ bacteria. Second, by studying how donor cells contact recipient cells we discovered that they achieve this by a special adhesin allowing covalent attachment between the two cells.

Lauryl gallate for use as antiviral effective vaccines and antivirals are key aspects for animal and human health control. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is one of the major concerns for animal health. It is also an interesting model system for understanding the interactions of a highly variable RNA virus and its natural hosts and the implications of these interactions on disease control with clear connections with the \"One Health\" approach. We are the development of FMDV peptide marker In particular, we are further understanding the zoonotic virus such as West Nile virus.
