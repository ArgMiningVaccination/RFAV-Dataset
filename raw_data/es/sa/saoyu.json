Workshop, manufacturing and distribution activities are performed in-house. Currently, there is demand in the market for low-cost, high-quality gluten free products derived either from a genetic condition or preference for more healthy consumption habits. This rising trend in conjunction with the lack of existing players in the market, creates an opportunity for a project aiming to satisfy customer needs tailoring its products to match restricted diets. Given the current situation in the market, \"Bambas\u00eda Bakery S.L.\" proposition is to create a wide variety of high-quality, delicious products from the hand of expert bakers who are constantly seeking, through exploration and experimentation with new ways of using ingredients, a gluten-free diet without giving up the taste and texture; and always using new methods and natural ingredients, additive-free, coloring-free, and without the use of artificial food preservatives. For this project we will create a branding strategy in accordance to the values and motivations of the company; a corporate identity handbook; the design of a \"Responsive Design\" web platform together with the implementation of a community/blog that will put the corporate structure in contact with its customer base (accesible from the website); and finally, merchandising applications, stationery, pop material, packaging and corporate networks.", "sitename": "Universitat Oberta de Catalunya", "date": "2021-07-01", "cleaned_text": "Por favor, use este identificador para citar o enlazar gr\u00e1fico [http://hdl.handle.net/10609/132790](http://hdl.handle.net/10609/132790) [Bachelor thesis, research projects, etc.](/handle/10609/47955) "}
