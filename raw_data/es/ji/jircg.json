Living close to nature, the indigenous Chinese people observed stars and planets and the unique qualities of the four seasons and perceived how contained in every cycle and aspect of life: change. Two classic Chinese books, the I Ching (The Book of Changes) and the Nei Jing (The Inner Classic of Chinese Medicine), both highlight change as their central theme. The I Ching presents life as change and provides guidance and advice on how to live in harmony with change. Life Cycles The first chapter in the Nei Jing Su Wen presents a major cycle of change: women and men's transitions through life seven brings natural, a summary the seven- and eight-year cycles for males and females found in the Nei Jing Su Wen.
