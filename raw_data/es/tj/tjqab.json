Northern Peru represents the locus of the old Axis.\" The roots of traditional healing practices in this region go as far back as the Cupisnique culture early in the first millennium BC. Northern Peru and Southern Ecuador share the same cultural context and flora but show striking differences in plant use and traditional knowledge. Two hundred fifteen plant species used for medicinal purposes in Ecuador and 510 plant species used for medicinal purposes in Peru were collected, vernacular healers, market vendors, and members of the public interviewed in Peru still have a very high knowledge of plants in their surroundings, which can be seen as a reflection of the knowledge of the population in general. In Ecuador much of the original plant knowledge has already been lost. In Peru, 433 (85%) were Dicotyledons, 46 (9%) Monocotyledons, 21 (4%) Pteridophytes, and 5 (1%) Gymnosperms. Three species species, Fabaceae (35), Lamiaceae (25), and Solanaceae and 11 species. of the plants used to and Ecuador. often collected wild, were used in two thirds of all cases in Peru, but in almost 95% of the cases in Ecuador. The most common applications included the ingestion of herb decoctions or the application of plant material as poultices. Although about 50% of the plants in use in the colonial period have disappeared from the popular pharmacopoeia, the overall number of plant species used medicinally has increased in Northern Peru, while Southern Ecuador shows a decline of plant knowledge since colonial times. Introduction Antecedents - Medicinal Plant Research and Traditional Medicine in Peru The primary focus of this project has been the ethnobotany of medicinal plants used in Northern Peru and Southern Ecuador and the changes that have occurred since early colonial times. Fieldwork for the present study was conducted in Southern Ecuador from 1995-2000 and in Northern Peru from 2001-2007. Precedents for this study have been established by the late seventeenth-century plant collections of Bishop Baltasar Jaime Mart\u00ednez de Compa\u00f1\u00f3n [ [1](#B1)], ethnoarchaeological analysis of the psychedelic San Pedro cactus [ [2](#B2)], curandera depictions in Moche ceramics [ [3](#B3)], and research on the medicinal plants of Southern Ecuador [ [4](#B4)- [6](#B6)] used in a field guide to the medicinal plants of the region [ [4](#B4), [5](#B5)]. Colonial records about useful plants of the region include Acosta [ [7](#B7)], Alcedo [ [8](#B8)], Cobo [ Mart\u00ednez de [ [ [12](#B12)], and Ruiz [ [13](#B13)]. Considerable progress has been made in the overall taxonomic treatment of the flora of Peru over the last few decades [ [14](#B14)]. However, while the Amazon rainforests have received a great of scientific attention, the mountain forests and remote highland areas unexplored. The conducted in decades without any further research activity. Until the late 1990s, little work had been done on vegetation structure, ecology, and ethnobotany in the mountain forests and coastal areas of the North. In spite of the fact that Northern Peru is the locus of what Lupe [ [16](#B16)] calls the \"health axis,\" healing center, of the old Central Andean culture area that stretched from Ecuador to Bolivia, little ethnobotanical research has been published on the rich shamanic lore found there. Early studies focused mainly of the famous \"magical\" and \"mind altering\" flora of Peru. A first study on \"cimora\" - another vernacular name for the San Pedro cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi, incorrectly identified by Cruz Sanchez to the 1940s [ [17](#B17)]. The first detailed study on a hallucinogen in Peru also focused on San Pedro and tree datura (Brugmansia spp.) [ [18](#B18)- [20](#B20)]. A variety of works on these species followed [ [21](#B21)- [24](#B24)]. Coca [33](#B33)]. Chiappe et [34](#B34)] were the first to attempt an overview on the use of hallucinogens in shamanistic practices in Peru. More comprehensive de Zandra [ [35](#B35)], Cabieses [ [36](#B36)], and Schultes & Hofmann [ [37](#B37)]. In his classical study of U\u00f1a de Gato, Peru's leading advocate for traditional medicine, and founding director of the Instituto Nacional de Medicina Tradicional del Ministerio de Salud, Fernando Cabieses [[ [38](#B38)] p 34], points out that the Peruvian Hermilio Valdiz\u00e1n and Angel Maldonado [ [15](#B15)] was pioneered the study of traditional medicine, leading to the emergence of medical anthropology nearly five decades later. In the interim the botanical exploration of the Peruvian flora and medicinal plants in particular included studies by Yakovleff and Herrera [ [39](#B39)] Weberbauer [ [ Valdivia [ [43](#B43)]. Most authors [ [44](#B44)- [50](#B50)] focused on Quechua herbalism of the Cusco area. Other comprehensive studies centered on the border region of Peru and Bolivia around Lake Titicaca [ [51](#B51)- [55](#B55)] and the Amazon [ [56](#B56)- [60](#B60)]. Northern Peru and Southern Ecuador, in contrast, had always fallen in the shadow of the more touristically important regions, and very few studies had been conducted before the mid-nineties [ [61](#B61)- [64](#B64)]. Since then our knowledge of the medicinal use of plants in the north has rapidly increased [ [65](#B65)- [70](#B70)]. The traditional use of medicinal plants in this region, which encompasses in particular the Peruvian Departments of Amazonas, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, and San Martin, as well as the Ecuadorian Province of Loja (Fig. [(Fig.1),1](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F1/)), dates as far back as the first millennium BC (north coastal Cupisnique culture) or at least to including variety \"power objects,\" pre-Columbian ceramics, staffs, stones, etc. are very common on Peruvian mesas and are blended with Christian symbols such as crosses are often the homes of the individual healers, who normally have their mesas set up in Healers also treat patients at altars their homes, at sacred sites in the countryside, or at sacred lagoons the herbal extracts on the whole body to fend off evil spirits and by \"Spiritual Flowerings\" (ba\u00f1os de florecimiento). In most cases, the cleansing of the patients involves drinking boiled include Christian components (e.g., the invocation of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and any number of saints), references to Andean cosmology (e.g., to the apus or the spirits of the mountains) are very common. The use of guinea pigs as diagnostic instruments is standard in Methods Plant Collections Plants in Peru were collected in the field, in markets, and at the homes of traditional healers (curanderos) visited in August-September 2007 and June-August 2008. The collection location. Vouchers of all specimens were deposited at the Herbario Truxillensis (HUT, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo) and Herbario Antenor Orrego (HAO, Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego Trujillo). In order to recognize Peru's rights under the Convention on Biological Diversity, especially with regard to the conservation of genetic resources in the framework of a study treating medicinal plants, the identification of the plant material was conducted entirely in Peru. No plant material was exported in any form whatsoever. The majority of were field visits in August-September 1995, May 1996, August-November 1996, March 1997, and June-July 1997. The specimens were registered under the collection series \"Bejar\" and \"CORD.\" Vouchers of all specimens collected in Ecuador were deposited at the Herbario Estaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica San Francisco (ECSF), Herbario Loja (LOJA), Herbario Nacional de Ecuador (QCNE), and Herbario de la Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Ecuador (QCA). The identification of the plant material was conducted entirely in Ecuador. No plant material was exported in any form whatsoever. For were used; to fit the western biomedical system. Surveys for the study, including the goal of conservation of medicinal plants in the area. The same number of healers (both male and female) was interviewed in Ecuador and Peru, after explaining the scope of the study and obtaining prior While the Peruvian In both countries, the healers did not want to be listed as co-authors. In contrast to Peru, no medicinal plants were sold in markets in Ecuador, indicating a large difference in the availability of plants. For this reason, market surveys concentrated on Peru only. In the main markets in Trujillo and Chiclayo, all vendors (110) were asked to participate in the surveys, but due to expected resistance information could not collected from everyone. From those who gave their prior informed consent, information was collected to plants to the surveyors, even when not giving any use information. For this reason, the market species inventory was complete. The vendors were also asked to the ten most commonly sold plants, and ten plants that were disappearing from the market. Of the plants that were most commonly sold and declining, information was also collected on the location (monta\u00f1a - mountain forest, costa - coast, sierra - highlands, or selva - jungle), origin (pueblo - village), cost per unit sold (soles), units sold per week (bultos - bundles, paquetes - packets), the time when the vendors' suppliers distribute goods, and any other information concerning the popularity of the plant. At each market, the number of medicinal plant vendors was counted to estimate how the vendors who participated in the study were representative for the entire market. Nomenclature The floras of North Peru and Southern Ecuador are part of the same floristic region and overlap to a very large extent. Both areas harbor about 4,000 species of vascular plants. The nomenclature of plant families, Catalogue the Flowering and Gymnosperms Peru [ [14](#B14)] and the Catalogue of Vascular Plants of Ecuador [ The identified using the available volumes of Flora of Peru [ [85](#B85)], as well as J\u00f8rgensen & Ulloa Ulloa [ [86](#B86)], Pestalozzi [ [87](#B87)] and Ulloa Ulloa & J\u00f8rgensen [ [88](#B88)], and the available volumes of the Flora of Ecuador [ [89](#B89)], and reference material in the herbaria HUT, HAO, QCA, LOJA, and QCNE. Cluster analysis of plant records The goal of cluster analysis is to group objects together that are similar. Data in the literature and market collections were organized in an Excel spreadsheet that arranged species 2.10L) was produced using the Simple Matching Coefficient that measures the degree of similarity/dissimilarity between all pairs of markets. Next, a dendrogram (tree) was generated with the UPGMA-SAHN method. Since a cluster analysis will always yield clusters, it is necessary to demonstrate how well the analysis represents the original (dis)similarity matrix. To this end, the tree matrix was transformed into a matrix of ultrametric distances and the latter matrix was statistically (dis)similarity \"r\" between both matrices Mantel can be used as a measure of goodness of fit for cluster analysis. The degree of fit can be interpreted subjectively as follows: 0.9 r: very good fit; 0.8 r < 0.9: good fit; 0.7 r < 0.8: poor fit; r 0.7: European descent). The similar habitus, often receive the same name (transposition). In other cases, completely names are created in Northern Peru reflect the historical development of use in species (e.g. Culantrillo, - growing the coastal regions of area - Sanguinaria), often addressed with names derived Spanish roots. Plants from the mountain forests, and especially the Andean highlands or the Amazon, few plant names can be traced back to Mochica (the original indigenous language spoken at the coast of Northern Peru) roots (e.g., Nectandra spp. - Espingo). Van den Eynden et al. [ [90](#B90)] observed similar patterns in Southern Ecuador, although her study focused only on edible species. Nine hundred thirty-eight vernacular names were recorded for 510 plant species. About one third of all names represented Quechua names or had Mochica roots, while 66.5% of all names were of Spanish origin or at least had Spanish components. In comparison, 41% of the vernacular names of edible plants in Southern Ecuador were found to be of Spanish origin. More than half of the indigenous species carried only one vernacular name, with a variety of 75% of the introductions were known by one name only. The slight differences in plant names indicate that the species have been used in the region for a long time and that their names reflect small variations in the local dialects. Plant Uses A total of 510 taxa belonging to 250 genera and 126 families are now on record for Peru. Of these, 504 could be identified, most of them to the species level. Four hundred thirty-three species (85%) were Dicotyledons, 46 (9%) Monocotyledons, 21 and 5 (1%) Gymnosperms. Three species (17%) were introductions. Many of the introduced species were medicinal plants that were brought in for treatment of European during colonial times (Table [(Table1).1](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/table/T1/)). with Fabaceae (35), Lamiaceae (25), and Solanaceae belonging to 158 genera and 76 families are on record for Ecuador. Of these, 214 could be identified, most of them to the species level. The number of plants in use represented only a fraction (about 5%) of the flora of the region. The families best represented are Asteraceae with 32 were introductions (Table [(Table1).1](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/table/T1/)). Many in during colonial ten plants with medicinal properties were registered in used for various medical conditions and applied in different for the condition. example, nervous disorders might be treated using different parts of a plant in different applications, e.g., topical (as a poultice or bath), oral (ingestion of plant extracts), and in the form of a \"seguro,\" a bottle with herbs and perfumes that serves as a protecting charm. Two thousand four hundred conditions were recorded. plants were for the treatment multiple The highest number of species (207, 40.4%) were used for the \"magical/ritual\" ailments like mal aire air; illness caused by spirits who influence passing adults), mal viento (bad wind, similar to mal aire but affecting mostly children), susto and espanto (fright, caused by a shock event in one's life or environment), mal ojo (evil eye, an illness mainly in children caused by persons with a negative glance), and envidia (envy, an illness of adults highest number of species (39) species) followed. Most treatments were performed in the homes of the individual healers, who normally had their mesas (healing altars) already set up. In most cases in Southern Ecuador, a \"Western\" altar with few power objects was employed (Fig. [(Fig.5),5](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F5/)), in contrast to Northern Peru, where up [(Figs.3,3](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F3/), herbal extracts on whole body to fend off evil spirits. Magical/Ritual healing Mal aire (bad air), mal viento (bad wind), susto and espanto (fright), mal ojo (evil eye) and envidia (envy) are seen as very common illnesses in Andean society. Causes include sudden of shock, spells cast by other people, poisoned food, etc. Medicinal problems caused by outside influences were in a wide variety of studies [ [51](#B51), [90](#B90)]. The Western Western medicine does not offer efficient alternatives to traditional treatment. This participation of the patient in a cleansing ceremony or limpia. This could either be a relatively simple spraying with perfumes and holy water, or an all-night ceremony involving the healer's curing altar (mesa). In after an all-night ritual, patients are normally treated with a florecimiento (flowering bath) in order to relieve them of any remaining adverse symptoms or spirits. herbs, as well perfumes, laminated images, and hair and fingernails of the patient. The enormous number of for the of psychosomatic disorders indicates that the curanderos of Northern Peru specialists who are consulted mainly for these conditions. This is all the more interesting since Western medicine has still not found efficient treatments psychosomatic from vicinity of sacred lakes, regions are to literally \"expel\" evil spirits is also very common. In contrast, in Ecuador only 59 applications fell into the magical category, with 39 plant species named to treat these disorders. Mal aire, susto, and sorcery were the most common magical illnesses encountered. Treatment in many cases involved the participation of the patient in a cleansing ceremony (limpia). This could either be a relatively simple spraying with perfumes and holy water, or an all- night ceremony involving Psychosomatic Problems The enormous role that curanderos play in the area of treatment of psychosomatic and nervous system problems becomes even more apparent when considering that a total of 98 species (19.1%) involved the treatment of nervous system disorders like depression, anxiety, insomnia, etc. Some of the plants used (e.g., Valeriana spp.), are used worldwide for the treatment of nervous disorders. A fair number of species (20) were used to treat nervous system disorders in Ecuador. This includes general nervous disorders, depression as well as psychological fatigue. Respiratory System Respiratory common and represented most common Peru. The local leading well as insufficient air circulation, account for the prevalence of these ailments. Many houses in rural areas have open stoves, with smoke causing constant irritation to the pulmonary system. Curanderos use 95 plant species (18.5%) for respiratory problems. In many rural areas in Ecuador and Peru, the smoke of cooking stoves still escapes through the roof or doorway. Consequently, a large variety of respiratory problems is very common. Houses are also often very damp and cold, especially at higher to respiratory (Kidneys, used on the urinary system. Some species employed (e.g., Chanca Piedra, literally \"Stonecrusher\" application of a poultice to the affected body part. Willow (Salix sp.), well for its an analgesic. to treat musculo-skeletal ailments in Ecuador. Most of these from the living conditions of the commonly treated conditions. This is another indication that curanderos in Northern Peru are to a large extent specializing in the treatment of psychosomatic disorders, and curanderos, independent of the gender of the healer. Infections of the ovaries, uterus, and vagina as well as post partum infections were very common conditions for which women sought the help of healers. Infections of this kind involved only 8 different species (1.6%), only one of which (Ruta graveolens) was induce abortions. Menstruation problems and complications in childbirth very in Southern Ecuador. Sixteen plants were employed to treat disorders, with to cure vaginal infections, and four species treatment to alleviate such infections is high blood pressure treated with seven species (1.4%), and low blood the circulatory system involved the purification of the blood in order to improve the general condition of the patient. Forty-four species (8.6%) used purifications. The main application for circulatory system problems in Ecuador was the treatment of heart pain. Twelve species were used for the treatment of heart conditions, including heart attacks and heart pain. Three overweight of point towards are very common in the Northern Peruvian work environment and are a major concern, especially in rural areas with 8.4% of all plants (43 species) used for the treatment of wounds. An additional 12 species (2.3%) were used for treatment of bleeding and hemorrhages. Bones The treatment of fractures, sprains and impotence, on improvement of potency, simply used as included a variety of conditions, from fevers accompanying flu, to fever as a result of malaria. Seventeen plant species (3.3%) were while other a symptom, mainly focusing on lowering body temperature. Yellow fever is very rare in Southern Ecuador. The frequent occurrence of the term in surprising. rather parts Loja province and does represent such cases often involved a single species at a time, with a total of 22 plant species (4.3%) used. The use of plant species in this could provide particularly interesting leads development. caused by bacteria, viral infections were mostly related dengue yellow fever and Intestinal, were species (2.1%). Bacterial and viral infections, especially wounds, were a concern in Ecuador. used, mostly as general pain, intense body pain (e.g., caused by dengue fever), of headaches, general pain, and toothache in Ecuador. Brain Memory loss and confusion, caused by old age were treated fainted (one species, 0.2%). In Southern Ecuador, a wide variety to treat each. were used for two-thirds (64%) remedies employed in Northern Peru are prepared using fresh plant material. Many of the introduced species are cultivated in fields and gardens, but the majority of the indigenous species are collected wild. This indicates that a widespread system of plant collectors is needed to supply the fresh plant material needed in traditional medicine. Most healers agreed that in most cases dried material could be used if fresh plants were not available. In 36% of all cases the remedies were prepared using specifically dried plant material. The main explanation for this, however, was that the plant material had to be transported from other regions, and thus fresh material either the leaves (in 25% of all uses) or the whole plant (24%) for the preparation of their remedies. In 19% of all cases, the stems of the plants were used, most commonly together with the leaves. Flowers (10%), seeds (7%), fruits and roots (4% each), bark (3%), fruit peel (2%), and latex and wood (1% each) were only used for a small a variety of plants in their treatments. The use of single species was rare. Most commonly, plant material was boiled in water, or in some cases in sugarcane alcohol (aguardiente), to extract the active compounds. In some cases, plant material was macerated in cane alcohol or wine for longer periods of time before use. The curanderos all had strikingly exact recipes for treatment, with very specific to prepare not another. the amount a specific remedy that was given to a patient was very similar among the different curanderos. Almost all remedies were prepared from fresh plant material (96%) [(Table2,2](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/table/T2/), [Fig.6).6](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F6/)). All of the introduced plant species were cultivated in fields and gardens, while most of the indigenous species were collected in the wild. The most frequent way to administer remedies was to prepare a ingest it orally (52% of all uses), followed by application as a poultice (38%, plant crushed or boiled and applied). Seven percent of all plant uses entailed the preparation of a seguro, a bottle or small flask filled with plant material along with various perfumes. This amulet has to be carried by the patient at all times, or it is placed in the house and used for periodic blessings. Seguros contained anything from a handful to more than three-dozen different ingredients. In two percent of the plant uses the material was employed to fabricate charms, and in one percent of all applications the plant material was burned as incense, with the smoke inhaled for in Ecuador. In most cases (61%) the whole plant was used for medicinal purposes, followed by leaves (13%), and flowers (6%); the seeds, roots, bark, fruits, and latex were rarely used (3% each) (Table [(Table3,3](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/table/T3/), Fig. [Fig.7).7](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F7/)). Peruvian healers a much more sophisticated knowledge of plant properties than their Ecuadorian colleagues. In frequently in both regions used a similar of their contrast, hardly any plants were used in Ecuador for the of All these uses were very common in Peru where, in fact over 40% of all plant species used had The remedies and and species normally used as food also some medicinal applications, as nutritional supplements to treat mineral and vitamin malnutrition, and were prepared and served as side-dishes or as their medicinal uses. Ceremonial Palm staffs (Bactris spp.) continue to be used as power objects on both Northern Peruvian and Ecuadorian mesas. The pharmacopoeae of Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru - Colonial regimes and their influence on plant use The differences in medicinal plant use between Southern Ecuador and Northern Peru are striking. Both regions share the same cultural background and have a very similar flora, with a comparable number of plant species that to a large extent overlap. However, the medicinal flora of Southern Ecuador includes only 40% of the species used in Northern Peru. The differences in traditional medicinal use can be explained by comparing the history of the pharmacopoeiae of both areas from the start of the colonial period until today. Colonial chroniclers often included detailed descriptions of in most early accounts of the economically interesting flora of Northern Peru and Southern Ecuador were provided by Monardes [ [12](#B12)], Acosta [ [7](#B7)], and Cobo [ [9](#B9), [10](#B10)]. Later were included in Alcedo [ [8](#B8)]. Mart\u00ednez Compa\u00f1on, Archbishop of Trujillo, had a complete inventory of his dioceses prepared [ [11](#B11)]. Finally, Ruiz and Pav\u00f3n provided the first real botanical inventory of the region [ [13](#B13)]. The account of Mart\u00ednez Compa\u00f1on [ [11](#B11)] provides the best baseline for a comparison of the colonial and modern medicinal flora of the region. The work includes detailed paintings for every species, which allows a close comparison with the modern medicinal flora, indicating that the vernacular names of useful plants have not changed significantly since It contains 526 useful plant species. A preliminary review of this seems to indicate the number of plants used has not changed significantly since the late 1700's, with over 500 plant species still found in modern Peruvian markets (Fig. [(Fig.12).12](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F12/)). A closer comparison shows, however, that only 41% of the species Martinez Compa\u00f1on [ [11](#B11)] are still sold nowadays in Peru. An additional 32% are still used in the Amazon basin, but do have completely disappeared from modern use. This means that 58% of the species sold in Peruvian markets and 41% of the species used in Ecuador were added to the pharmacopoeia within the last 200 years (Fig. [(Fig.1313](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F13/)). A cluster analysis of the colonial and modern plant inventories (Fig. [(Fig.14)14](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F14/)) provides a striking explanation for the use differences between Ecuador and Peru, and helps to explain why the plant inventories changed indicates that the current pharmacopoeia of useful flora in Ecuador is most similar to the early colonial flora mentioned in Monardes [ [12](#B12)], Acosta [ [7](#B7)], Cobo [ [9](#B9), [10](#B10)] and Alcedo [ [8](#B8)]. This suggests that the Ecuadorian medicinal flora did not develop much between early and late colonial times. In contrast, the modern Peruvian healing flora is much more similar to later collections. An explanation for this lies in the different treatment of traditional practices in Ecuador and Peru; in Ecuador, traditional were immediately persecuted once the colonial administration took hold, while the Peruvian administration was much more tolerant. This also reflects in the establishment of a National Institute for Traditional Medicine in Peru in the 1980s, while traditional medicine was illegal in Ecuador, until a meant that to experiment with new species to cure diseases introduced by Europeans, while Peruvian healers were able to explore the rich flora of the region in order to find new remedies. This experimentation also extended to \"magical\" disease concepts like Mal Aire, Mal Ojo, Susto, and Envidia that were introduced from Spain during the colonial regime. Peruvian healers vast array of medicinals these conditions, which, to a large extent explains the shift in the medicinal flora between the late 1700s and modern times. Experimentation in Ecuador remained restricted to the treatment of common while spiritual were outlawed until a constitutional revision in 1998 recognized the population to use traditional medicinal practices. Conclusion Current research indicates that the composition of the local pharmacopoeia has changed since colonial times [ [1](#B1)]. However, in Peru the overall number of medicinal plants employed seems to have remained at a comparable level, while plant use in Southern Ecuador has decreased. This indicates that the Northern Peruvian health tradition is still going strong, and that the healers and public are constantly experimenting with new remedies. One appearance (Morinda fruits and products in large quantities in plant pharmacies and markets in the region since 2005. This plant was not available before, but is heavily marketed worldwide. Peruvian sellers are clearly reacting to a global market trend and are trying to introduce this new species to their customers. This indicates that local herbalists and include in own repertoire. In Southern Ecuador, healers were not able to experiment with new remedies due to persecution and legal restrictions. As a result, the pharmacopoeia in this region remained on an early colonial level, with loss of significant knowledge. The use of hallucinogens, in particular the San Pedro cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi), is still a vital component of Andean healing [62](#B62), [80](#B80)- [83](#B83)]. San Pedro can and Moche iconography [ suppression Western medicine has not managed to destroy this tradition in Peru. The use of San Pedro, together with additives like Angel's Trumpet (Brugmansia spp.), Jimsonweed (Datura part ceremonies in Northern Peru. Healers are in fact some formally acknowledged, Southern Ecuador falls into the Northern Peruvian cultural area. It appears to represent a region where traditional plant knowledge, not mentioned a mind-altering plant by any healer or used in have led of traditional knowledge. This is also reflected current study. Many plants used for purposes in Peru [ [23](#B23)] have disappeared from traditional use in Ecuador. The fear of prosecution is still very deeply rooted in the healer community, and most healers interviewed stated that they did not wish to be cited by name. Most healing altars or mesas in Southern Ecuador are almost Patients are cleansed by spraying them with holy water and perfumes. In rare cases tobacco juice and also incantations used cosmology almost use of guinea pigs as diagnostic instruments has all but disappeared from the tool kit of these healers. Interestingly, Peruvian curanderos have started to fill this spiritual void in Southern Ecuador. Healers from the Northern Peruvian mountains and coastal plains frequently cross over to Ecuador to offer their services to patients - including increasing numbers of foreigners with a \"New Age\" orientation who are with Westernized approach of Ecuadorian healers. These Peruvian colleagues have much more elaborate plant knowledge, and their mesas as well as their incantations follow a more traditional pattern. The knowledge of medicinal plants is still taught by word of mouth, with no written record. Illustrated identification guides for the medicinal plants of Northern Peru and Southern Ecuador and their uses [ [67](#B67), [68](#B68)] will hopefully help to keep the extensive traditional knowledge of this alive. However, Traditional increasing demand, as the fact that the number of herb vendors, in particular in the markets of Trujillo, has increased in recent years. Also, a wide variety of medicinal plants from Northern Peru can be found in the global market. While this trend might help to maintain traditional practices and to give traditional knowledge the respect it deserves, it poses a serious threat, as signs of over-harvesting of important species are becoming serious threat to this millennial tradition is the destruction of medicinal habitats. Urban sprawl has already greatly altered the coastal plains around Trujillo and Chiclayo. Climatic change is threatening the mountain forest systems that are the source of many medicinal species. Most importantly, the high Andean ecosystems and sacred lagoons many medicinally active species manuscript.

With regard to ritual and therapeutic practices we especially want to thank the above curanderas, as well as curandero Leoncio Carri\u00f3n. For three field seasons we were fortunate to have the anthropological expertise Reyes, Jason Gilbreath; biologist and Steven Skoczen. A debt of gratitude goes to our dedicated Kaye Sharon, Tucker Sharon, and Renee Summerfield. Thanks to Eric Rodriguez (Herbarium Truxillense, HUT) and Abundio Sagastegui, Segundo Leiva, and Mario Zapata (Herbario Antenor Orrego, HAO) for the use of their facilities and assistance in plant identification. Many thanks to Ina Vandebroek of New York Botanical Garden for conducting the cluster analysis presented in Fig. [Fig.14,14](/pmc/articles/PMC2655273/figure/F14/), and supplying the description of the relevant methodology. The partial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) is acknowledged. Most of all, we want to express our sincere gratitude to the people of Northern Peru for sharing their ethnobotanical knowledge. References - Sharon D, Bussmann RW.
