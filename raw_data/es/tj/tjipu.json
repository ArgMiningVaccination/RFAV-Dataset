The call to action is a response to the substandard TRIPS waiver text agreed by WTO members after nearly two years of delaying from wealthy countries, including the EU, U.S. and Canada. French and Spanish versions of the call to action, along with an addendum on action governments can take to remove intellectual property rights barriers to access to Covid vaccines, treatments and technologies, can be found on the website of the Trade Justice Education Fund here.***Governments Must Break Big Pharma-WTO Stranglehold on Access to MedicineMore than two years into a pandemic that has killed 15 million people, World Trade Organization intellectual property barriers shamefully remain a deadly obstruction limiting global access to COVID-19 vaccines, tests & treatments. A few wealthy countries promoting pharmaceutical corporation interests have been able to block the use of the WTO's waiver mechanism to temporarily suspend such barriers despite more than 100 WTO member countries supporting a waiver. The WTO's notoriously exclusionary, oppressive processes have been deployed instead to force through a sham text that will not improve global access to COVID-19 medicines because it not only fails to remove IP obstacles but outrageously adds further constraints to existing WTO flexibilities for medicines production. This outrageous situation underscores that governments must take immediate actions to bypass the WTO's prioritization of pharmaceutical monopolies over human lives.By acting on behalf of pharmaceutical interests and blocking WTO removal of intellectual property (IP) barriers to global vaccines, tests, and treatment access, the European Union, Switzerland and United Kingdom have betrayed the billions of people worldwide who still need access to lifesaving vaccines, medications, and diagnostics. In failing to deliver on a vaccine waiver for which it announced support and blocking the inclusion of treatments and tests, the United States has also turned its back on a planet desperate for the COVID pandemic to end.The failure to temporarily waive the WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as demanded by the vast majority of the world's countries and by public health experts and health workers, generic medicine manufacturers, human rights advocates, faith leaders, labor unions, community groups, scores of Nobel laureates and former heads of state, the World Health Organization Director-General and even the Pope spotlights just how broken and dangerously out-of-touch the WTO remains.Health needs cannot be subservient to pharmaceutical monopoly's profits. In response to the ongoing failure to adopt a temporary waiver of pharmaceutical IP monopolies on COVID medical countermeasures, civil society organizations around the globe are calling on governments to:1. Pledge not to use the WTO's and other trade and investment agreements' dispute mechanisms or other means in an attempt to stop or dissuade countries from producing, distributing or using medical technologies or from sharing information on how to do so regardless of WTO and free trade agreement IP rules;2. Take every step necessary to save lives and end the pandemic, including by fully using the WTO's existing, albeit limited, flexibilities;3. Circumvent the WTO's pharmaceutical monopoly rules when possible and outright defy those rules when needed.This united call comes as the WTO concludes its most significant decision-making meeting since the start of the COVID-19 \u2014 the 12th WTO ministerial Conference \u2014 without agreeing to temporarily remove WTO IP rules that restrict the production and supply of COVID vaccines, diagnostics and therapeuticsFor roughly 20 months, the obstinance and bullying of a few very economically-powerful WTO member states was allowed to run roughshod over the wishes of more than 100 countries to waive WTO TRIPS obstacles to global access to COVID-19 medical tools. The TRIPS waiver text proposed in October 2020 by South Africa and India enjoyed cosponsorship from 65 WTO member countries, but outrageously negotiations on this text were never allowed. Under the WTO's unacceptable processes, a text written by the WTO Secretariat and supported only by the main waiver-blocker, the European Union, was pushed forward to be railroaded through the Ministerial. History will harshly record the WTO's contribution to COVID vaccine, treatment and test apartheid.The WTO's threat to global access to medicines did not start with COVID-19. For decades, the WTO has steadfastly refused to put shared global priorities like saving lives and ending pandemics ahead of the narrow profit and power-seeking interest of pharmaceutical monopolies. This was clear at the turn of the century during the peak of the HIV/AIDS crisis, and has only become even more clear with the WTO's unconscionable inaction during the COVID crisis today.The WTO's draconian IP rules have already contributed to prolonging the current pandemic and, if countries can't get these rules out of the way, they will continue to contribute to massive public health, economic and social damage during future pandemics as well. And pandemics are not the only matters of concern. Billions of people lack access to lifesaving medicines that prevent, treat and cure illnesses because intellectual property regimes distort research priorities, create scarcity by artificially restricting supplies, and allow excessive pricing and inequitable distribution that affects the poor and people living in lower-income countries. Countries that don't accept these rules are subjected to trade threats and repercussions, undermining their own sovereign processes and rules. This cannot continue.The world must not allow the deadly vaccine apartheid that characterized the first generation of COVID vaccine manufacturing and distribution to be recreated when it comes to COVID diagnostics, treatments and second-generation vaccines. With the WTO process failing to suspend WTO IP rules to prevent this ongoing and disastrous injustice, governments who are also WTO member states must now act in good faith outside of the WTO's strictures.ActionAid InternationalAfrican AllianceALAMES InternacionalAmnesty InternationalAsia Pacific Council of AIDS Service Organizations (APCASO)Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law, and DevelopmentAsian-Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (ARROW)Association of Women of Southern Europe (AFEM)Building and Wood Workers' International, Asia Pacific (BWI AP)Campaign of CampaignsCoalition of Agriculture Workers International (CAWI)Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO)DAWN (Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era) =Doctors for Global HealthFEMNET- African Women's Development & Communication NetworkFocus on the Global SouthFree the Vaccine for COVID-19Friends of the Earth InternationalFrontline AIDSGender and Trade NetworkGlobal Call to Action Against Poverty (GCAP)GreenpeaceHealth Action International (HAI)Internacional de los Servicios P\u00fablicos, Sub-region Andina (ISP Andina)International Trade Union ConfederationInternational Women's Rights Action Watch Asia PacificInternational-Lawyers.orgM\u00e9decins du Monde International NetworkOxfamPartners In HealthPeople's Health Movement (PHM)People's Health Movement (PHM) EuropePeoples Vaccine AlliancePeople's Vaccine Alliance - AsiaProgressive DoctorsProject Organising Development Education and Research (PODER)Public Services International (PSI)Public Services International, Southeast Asia (PSI SEA)Regions RefocusSexual Rights InitiativeSocial WatchSociety for International Development (SID)South Asia Alliance for Poverty Eradication (SAAPE)South Feminist FuturesSumOfUsTransnational InstituteUNI Global UnionUniversities Allied for Essential Medicines - UAEMVaccine Advocacy Resource GroupVacunas para la gente (PVA-LAC)World Federation of Public Health AssociationsAsociaci\u00f3n Sindical de Profesionales de la Salud de la Provincia de BuenosAires / CICOP - ArgentinaCentro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS) - ArgentinaCTM (Confederaci\u00f3n de trabajadores municipales de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina) - ArgentinaFederaci\u00f3n Argentina de Medicina General - ArgentinaFesprosa - ArgentinaFundaci\u00f3n Grupo Efecto Positivo - ArgentinaFundacion para Estudio e Investigacion de la Mujer - ArgentinaiIGG / UBA - ArgentinaInstituto del Mundo del Trabajo - ArgentinaInvestigadora asociada al GT Salud Internacional CLACSO - ArgentinaMovimiento Nacional de salud LAICRIMPO - ArgentinaMovimiento por la Salud de los Pueblosa - ArgentinaPeople's Health Movement (PHM) Andean Region - ArgentinaSociology of Health Dept. - University of Buenos Aires - ArgentinaUnion de Tabajadores de la Salud - ArgentinaActionAid Australia - AustraliaAustralian Fair Trade and Investment Network - AustraliaAustralian Nursing Federation (SA Branch) - AustraliaNSW Nurses and Midwives Association - AustraliaPublic Health Association of Australia - AustraliaUniting Church in Australia, Synod of Victoria and Tasmania - AustraliaBangladesh Women Welfare Workers Union - BangladeshNaripokkho - BangladeshNRDS, Bangladesh - BangladeshUBINIG (Policy Research for Development Alternative) - BangladeshAlliance nationale des Mutualit\u00e9s chr\u00e9tiennes / National Alliance of Christian Mutual Health Funds - BelgiumCETRI - Centre tricontinental - BelgiumViva Salud - BelgiumAsociaci\u00f2n Latinoamericana de Medicina Social ALAMES - BoliviaBolivian Commitee for Consumer's Rights Protection CODEDCO - PHM Bolivia - BoliviaMovimiento de la Salud de los Pueblos - BoliviaMovimiento de Salud Popular y Agroecolog\u00eda de Bolivia - BoliviaAGANIM-RJ - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Amigos e Gays de Nova Igua\u00e7u, Mesquita e Rio de Janeiro - BrasilANAIDS - Articula\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Lut...", "sitename": "Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "The CCPA's Trade and Investment Research Project is one of hundreds of international civil society groups to endorse the following call to action, which was issued on June 16 following the conclusion of the WTO's 12th ministerial conference, MC12, in Geneva.
