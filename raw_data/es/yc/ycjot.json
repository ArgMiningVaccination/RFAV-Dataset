We will put special emphasis on dynamics of human motion and tissue mechanics. Students will conduct experiments and computer simulations in the lab to understand how the biomechanics can be applied to more practical situations.

The technological versatility of integration with new materials and the wide range of possible applications, facilitate their application in many areas of science and engineering. This course is oriented, for those who want to start working in the field of MEMs applied to the life sciences of R & D.

In the traditional approach to design, engineers construct a physical prototype and test it in the laboratory. Physical prototypes have many major drawbacks: they are typically expensive to build and modify, to physical prototyping, one builds a computer model using mathematical equations that is as close to the physical model as possible-the exact shape and size and the exact of computer prototyping can be attributed to the tremendous advancement in computer hardware and software that has minimized the need for mathematical expertise and effort to a bare minimum so that the user can concentrate on the manipulation of the \"physical\" process on the computer. This course will introduce computer using a physics-based simulation To avoid potential misuse of the software, we learn not to use it as a black box. We do this by discussing (although solution of the equations, etc. We look at heat and mass transfer problems in biomedical/biological processes such as cryosurgery, hyperthermia, and half of the course is dedicated to design projects that you choose and work in small groups (each group has a different project).
