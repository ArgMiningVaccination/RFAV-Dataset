Overall Increased, but of ICL ............................ 53 C. Role of the Regional Human in Bringing ICL courts have seen an explosion of criminal prosecutions for serious human rights violations committed during the country's dictatorship, which spanned 1973 to 1990. At the same time, international courts have seen the rebirth of the field of international criminal law through the works of the ad hoc tribunals,1 hybrid courts, and the International Criminal Court (ICC). These courts have produced a bevy of judicial decisions fleshing out the contours of international criminal law (ICL) and the Rome Statute, the treaty creating the ICC and a template of ICL.2 This Article examines the use of ICL, in particular the ICL of the ICC, in the post -Pinochet human rights trials in Chile. Drawing on a review of Chilean judicial decisions and case materials, interviews with judges, lawyers, academics, and human rights gr concludes that ICL has role to remove hurdles, particularly the 1 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda are known as \"ad hoc tribunals\" due to their temporally - constrained and conflict -specific mandate.

Rep. of the Prep. Comm. for the Int'l Crim. Court, Addendum: Finalized domestic statutes of limitations. Upon acknowledging the crimes as crimes against humanity or war crimes, courts could then invoke international law norms requiring states to crimes against humanity. This crimes against humanity argument was not the only argument presented in favor of allowing prosecutions to go forward, but it came to be a central one. Litigants and courts also invoked ICL to reframe the crimes order to argue for \"proportional,\" meanin g greater, punishment. To a more limited degree, courts have engaged with ICL to help interpret substantive legal questions cases for dictatorship -era human rights violations is in some ways a one -off.

The legality principle complicates the use of law stemming from these courts, but has not precluded their use altogether. This article examin es the ways Chilean courts have navigated these waters and used ICL their decisions dealing with crimes that to the level of international crimes.3 The of ICL in on the world stage as a participant in international criminal justice efforts like the ICC.

Finally, this article adds a new and compelling argument for greater attention to regional human rights courts. Recently, regional human rights courts have garnered some valuable scholarly attention.12 However, none of the has focused on the role, potential or realized, of regional human rights courts in distilling and translating ICL norms for domestic courts.

In September 1998, in the landmark Poblete Cordoba case, Chilean Supreme Court overturned the ourt's dismissal case for enforced disappearance based on the argument that Chile was a party to the Geneva Conventions at the time of the offenses and the Conventions not only prohibited \"attempts against life and physical integrity\" and \"attempts against personal dignity,\" but also of the principles of the Geneva Conventions.29 In finding that an armed conflict existed at the time of the crimes , the court deemed it significant that the regime itself had declared a state of siege.30 Chile had signed the Geneva Conventions prior to the dictatorship, and therefore the theory was to judges and attorneys a legality perspective as a non -retroactive determinar , de acuerdo a los antecedentes que se presenten, qui \u00e9nes son las personas que sufrieron privaci \u00f3n de libertad y torturas por razones pol \u00edticas, por actos de agentes del Estado o de personas a su ser vicio, en el per \u00edodo comprendido entre el 11 de septiembre de 1973 y el 10 de marzo de 1990.\") See also INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE DERECHOS HUMANOS , INFORME ANUAL (2017) (providing statistics on the numbers of victims recognized by each commission). 26 Judging from a Guilty Conscience , supra note 4 (\"[T]here was no purge of the judiciary after the 1990 transition to democracy, and judges remained loath to pursue claims. cases to inch forward, and filed until 1998.\"). 27 Collins, Post -Transitional Justice, supra note 19, at 81. 28 Id. at 82, 104 -5.

In 2004, the Supreme Court added another argument to support proceeding on human rights cases, notwithstanding the statute of limitation and amnesty, for cases of e nforced disappearance. In the Sandoval Rodriguez case, the court noted that the aggravated kidnapping charges amounted to aggravated kidnapping is an ongoing crime until a person has been found, dead or alive, the amnesty did not apply (since it covered crimes only up until 1978) and the statute of limitations could not toll.38 This rationale had its limitations, as it applied only to cases of enforced disappearance and not to executions or torture. 2005 saw a step backward for human rights cases when the Supreme Court retreated from its holding in Poblete Cordoba . In a case of extrajudicial execution of 22 -year-old and 15 -year-old students, the court found that there had been no armed conflict in Chile during the dictatorship and thus the Geneva Conventions did not apply. It then dismissed the homicide case on statute of limita tion grounds. 39 In 2006, the pendulum swung again. The Inter -American Court of Human Rights (Inter -American Court) gave the Chilean judiciary another big push to advance on human rights cases. In an embarrassment to Chilean courts and the government, the Inter-American Court found Chile in violation of the Inter - American Convention on Human Rights (American Convention) based on its failure to prosecute those responsible for killing Mr. Almonacid in Almonacid v.

Some invocations of violations, also invoked ICL for of reasons.

The Crimes Against Humanit y Overlay The principal way in which ICL has entered the Chilean human rights prosecutions is through the concept of \"lesa humanidad\" (crimes against humanity). Courts convict for a domestic crime but note that the acts amount to crimes against humanity u nder ICL. has been used ends. First and foremost, by reframing the acts noring the amnesty and statutes of limitation. The crimes against humanity gloss used general rhetorical tool for emphasizing the gravity of offenses. It is worth noting that crimes against humanity is a concept that is invoked even without discussion of the terms \"international criminal law\" or the ICC. While there ar e some 220 decisions on Westlaw Chile citing \"international 24 University of [Vol. 26:1 criminal law\" or \"International Criminal \"crimes against humanity.\"78 This are a large number of decisions in which Chilean courts are invoking the concept of crimes against humanity without tethering it to any discussion of ICL as a field or the Rome Statute.79 1. Defining Crimes Against Humanity Courts frequently invoked ICL the to define against humanity.80 Courts cited the ICL or the ICC as part of discussions on the elements of crimes against humanity. In particular, courts cited ICL or the ICC for the requirements that the act be committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack with know ledge of the attack, or for the types of acts that can amount to a crime against humanity.81 A recent Supreme Court case finding that a police officer's shooting of the victim for violation of the curfew laws constituted a crime against humanity cited the Rome Statute's definition of the crime, noting the requirements for a widespread or systematic attack and a state policy, as the hallmarks of crimes against humanity. The court found both to be met, as the shooting was part of a \"state policy of repression of political views contrary of of civilians, the impunity that the generated conduct. \"82 However, \"lesa humanidad\" in the Westlaw Chile caselaw (jurisprudencia) 2018 yielded 718 results. An excellent thesis written by two graduates, offers a helpful taxonomy of the Chilean courts use of the concept of crimes against humanity (lesa humanidad) in cases from 2006 to 2013. See Maria Fernanda Gil Herrera & Valentina Manzur Toro, Cr\u00edmenes de lesa Humanidad en Chile: Sistematizaci\u00f3n de Argumentos de los Fall os Emitidos Por los Tribunales Superiores del Pa\u00eds (2006 -2013) (Aug. 2017) (unpublished thesis) (on file with the author). 79 Some of these cases may include citations to other modern international tribunals, but likely not all. A search of Westlaw Chile us ing the term, Yugoslavia, for example, yielded only 64 decisions, of which more than half the searches for the terms ICL and ICC captured in this using the term crimes nst in particular the requirement of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population and the types of acts that constitute crimes against humanity, such as murder and 36 of 158 cases using the term ICC invoke the Ro me Statute's definition of crimes against humanity. 81 Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 19 junio 2018, \"Unidad del Programa de Derechos Humanos de la Subsecretar\u00eda de Derechos Humanos y ostros c.

As lawyers benefitted from media prescripci\u00f3n largely depended on court in the prohibition of statute of limitations for war crimes an d crimes against humanity found in international law, courts cited ICL's mandate to ensure punishment proportional to the gravity of crimes as another reason to reject the doctrine of media prescripci\u00f3n.

The court's logic is interesting for a few reasons. First, it provides a sample of the arguments made to recast the crimes. Second, it illustrates the demand for strong condemnation, which precludes application of is listed as a doctrine of IHL (the law of war), whereas it is typically thought of as an ICL doctrine.108 107 Corte Suprema de Justicia [C.S.J.] [Supreme Court], 18 mayo 2016, \"Ministerio del Interior y otros c.

Effectively, courts have argued that even if Chile had not yet ratified the Convention on No n-Applicability of Statutes of Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity at the time of the offenses, ICL, along with IHRL, has made this a jus cogens norm, or at least a general principle of international law that binds Chile.

No Conflict The most frequent invocation of ICL that cuts in favor of defendants (and against criminal accountability for human rights violations) appeared in arguments that there was no internal armed conflict at the time of the crimes. As noted above, in 1998, the Supreme Court in Poblete Cordoba invoked the Geneva Conventions for the proposition that Chile was obligated to prosecute and punish war and thus could not apply domestic statutes of limitations or the amnesty. In decision after decision of the Supreme Court, for a time in the majority and later in the dissent, certain justices of the Supreme Court, in particular Justices Ballesteros and Segura, argued that the requirements for a non-international armed conflict were not met and that the Geneva Conventions therefore did not apply.147 146 C\u00d3DIGO PENAL [C\u00d3D.

A Supreme Court decision of June 25, 2018, noted the defendant's argument that his actions did not meet the standard of ICL for crim es against humanity since they were not part of a widespread or systematic attack.150 The defendant was the commander of a unit responding to a demonstration. He ordered that they either shoot in the air or shoot directly at protesters if in danger. One of his and killed the victim. The defendant argued, unsuccessfully, that his a cts were not part of a widespread or systematic attack. The defendant cited for support Article 7 of the Rome Statute and the Chilean legislation incorporating the Rome Statute the gravity of the crimes. Defendants and judges at times have turned the gravity argument on its head by arguing that the defendant's conduct was insufficiently grave to be a crimes against humanity.

Superior Orders Perhaps the most striking instance of ICL being a defendant's favor in the Endesa case.163 The case involved the prosecution of three defendants, including the head of a detention center, Walter Klug Rivera, for their roles in the killing of 23 workers from the Endesa electricity plant in September of 1973. The trial judge (Ministro de fuera) acquitted of the Rome recognition of obedience of superior orders as a defense.164 the court noted, the Rome Statute recognizes superior orders as a defense, unlike t he Nuremberg tribunal or the ad hoc tribunals, which viewed it only as a potential mitigating factor.165 Turning instead to domestic law Court of Appeals overturned the decision on appeal.166 It found that, though the elements of the defense of superior orders at the time of the offense under Chilean law were unclear, Klug had law's requirement for the defense of superior orders under any definition by failing to present evidence that there was an order from a superior.167 The trial court's invocation of ICL, and in particular the Rome Statute, is striking because it was one of the only instances of a Chilean court explicitly turning to ICL to the contour of Whereas to ICL for the elements of crimes against humanity, the establishment of which precluded application of statutes of limitations or the amnesty, here the court was looking to define a defense to the underlying Chilean charge by borrowing one from the Rome some ways, this move is less crimes no prohibition on applic ation of law more favorable to an accused under the legality principle and, 163 Ministro de Fuero [M.D.F.] [trial court], 15 noviembre 2010, \"Episodio Endesa,\" causa: 2182 -1998, Sentencia. 164 Id. \u00b6 17 (\"El Estatuto, en el art\u00edculo 3 3.1 a), b), y c), y 2, concordado con el art\u00edculo 28, letra b) en lo que respecta a las \u00f3rdenes entre superiores subordinados, dispone que ellas pueden constituir una eximente cuando la persona que ha cometido el crimen estuviera obligado por ley a obedece r \u00f3rdenes emitidas por el Gobierno o el superior de que se trate, no supiera que la orden era il\u00edcita y, en el caso de los cr\u00edmenes de guerra, que la orden no fuera manifiestamente il\u00edcita (Estatuto de la Corte Penal Internacional).\") 165 Id. \u00b6 18. 166 Corte d e Apelaciones [C.

It is a striking example of a Chilean court using international law to define a defense to Chilean charges. Nevertheless, this application of ICL did not stand for long, as it was reversed on appeal. 5. Sentencing a c ouple of cases, justices cited Article 110 of the Rome Statute for the proposition that a judge \" may\" but \"must\" consider sentencing reductions, and only after a person has done a third of the sentence or, in the case of a life sentence, twenty -five years.169 In each case, the Rome Statute provision were in the dissent and were in favor of rejecting release based on the gravity of the crimes.170 It although it is not entirely clear from the decisions, that the y were a defense argument for a sentencing one prosecution of minors for t The 168 See, e.g. , ICCPR, art. 15 (\"No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.

ICL has also found its way into argument s in favor of recognizing the defense of superior sentencing ICL in Contemporary all or the ICC occur in cases adjudicating dictatorship era hum an rights violations. Unsurprisingly, a few cases in the Constitutional Court relate to the constitutionality of the Rome Statute itself or the Chilean legislation implementing the constitutional.) However, ICL a rguments have appeared in a variety of criminal cases outside of the context of the human rights abuses of the Pinochet regime. First, ICL has come up repeatedly in the context of extradition of human rights violators from neighboring countries. Most nota bly perhaps, in litigation over the extradition of former Peruvian dictator, Alberto Fujimori. In the decision approved Fujimori's extradition, the Supreme of 171 Rome Statute, supra note 2, art. 26 (\"The court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the alleged commission of a crime.\"). 172 See MARK A.

The argument did not prosper. The court ultimately stripped the senator of immunity, but in particular, references to the ICC, appear not only in the context the dictatorship -era human rights but also in contemporary cases, some human rights -related and others not. These invocations of ICL in ne w contexts seem to suggest that once judicial actors gain familiarity with ICL and view it as a viable source of arguments, it will be marshalled in new and varied contexts. IV. LESSONS FROM THE CHILEAN HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE The Chilean human rights which have turned to ICL are instructive. They ind icate that, at least where Rome reveals transformation of ICL hits arena, with adjustment on importance critical role being played by the Inter -American Court as the gateway for ICL norms, as well as the utility of the ICC regime in providing a more solid fo undation for the invocation of ICL norms.

Courts also justified the legality (in the sense of non -retroactivity) of reliance on ICL and international human rights norms i n a wide variety of manners. ICL incorporation does not occur in a vacuum. As many commentators have noted, many advances in human rights cases have depended on a changing judiciary more willing to press for accountability and more open to international norms.189 This observation appears to hold true in the invoking ICL and the ICC. In many instances, it is the very same justices making the very same arguments over and over, and all that shifts is the composition of the court and a majorit y argument becoming a minority one or a minority a majority.190 Moreover, a review of a in the human rights cases, it is not doing the work alone.

Rare was the judge who applied the Amnesty Decree in cases of disappearance and extrajudicial killing. Some had even allowed torture cases to move forward, an action that could only be justified under international law. The few cases to which the Amnesty Decree was applied were 2019] ICL by Analogy rights cases indicate that ICL is but one source from which judges draw to help justify arguments under international law. B. Invocation, Conflation, and The of decisions courts seemed to insert extra requirements into the definition of crimes against humanity, to such things as gravity, not present the ICC's of instances of judges (half empty) in ICL rightly has received a great deal of attention. 194 The different fora in which ICL is used \u2014 different international criminal tribunals (some ad hoc, one permanent), hybrid domestic -international criminal tribunals, domestic courts \u2014combined with the different legal traditions of actors within any given international court, makes inevitable.195 the purported universality of ICL norms,196 but there is usually reversed at the Supreme Court level. The reliance on international law was a milestone, but one in a string of many. Thus, it is impossible to attribute this switch to the Inter -American Court's single decision, or even its line of decisions. Rather, the Inter -American Court provided one more tool in the kit of those arguing against the Amnesty Decree, and it made it that much more inconceivable for the Su preme Court to apply the Amnesty Decree in the cases that it had not already closed.\"). 192 See discussion supra note 106 and accompanying text. 193 See generally A.

Although the Chilean a to invoke ICL and the Rome Statute after Chile formal ized its participation in the Rome regime through signing of the treaty and the passage of domestic implementing legislation, it also shows that the Rome Statute still has rhetorical force outside of contexts to which before implementing courts were citing ICL for the proposition that international law precluded application of the amnesty or statute of limitation for crimes against humanity or war crimes, as defined by the Rome Statute.233 Thus, following the logical template of the Inter Chilean courts used ICL to interpret Chile's obligations convict directly based on adjudicating pre - Rome Statute cri mes elsewhere could do much the same, as could courts of non -state parties. F. ICL Spillover Effects The use of Chilean human rights cases suggests that once ICL is on the table as a source of arguments and judges and lawyers become familiar with it, it will be used to support different ends and in different contexts. The cases discussed above illustrate an expansion in the use of ICL from merely an argument to avoid application of statutes of limitations and the amnesty, to an argument to support p roportional punishment (i.e. no media prescripci\u00f3n), reparations (i.e. no statute of limitations for civil cases, not just criminal), and special protection for minors, among other arguments. It The invocations of the cases reveal that these ICL arguments may not be restricted their most obvious Although they are in contemporary cases are likewise invoking IC L and the law of the ICC to support arguments related to extradition, the rule human human rights cases as having affected the judiciary's openness to international law in other areas. Minister 2 explained that the \"human rights cases opened the path for the protection of other human rights,\" including discrim ination and gender, and for greater reliance on international law arguments and even a greater tendency to turn to the 233 See supra Part III.D.1 and III.D.2. 234 See supra Part III .G. 62 University of California, Davis [Vol. 26:1 fundamental rights provisions of the constitution in other contexts.235 Human rights lawyer Eduardo Contreras says that, more broadly spea king, the human rights cases have generally raised the bar in the legal system: \"the role of the trials has judiciary \u2014an ethical Thus, the courts' ICL, in the dictatorship -era ca ses may contribute to a greater openness to international law and rights -based arguments throughout the judiciary and in a variety of different areas of the law. Still, the effects of the Chilean human rights cases on human rights in Chile is complicated. The promotion of ICL and human rights in criminal cases in a deeply divided society has a complex impact on promotion of these bodies of law in Chile going forward. On the one hand, Pandora's box has been opened and there is far greater familiarity and acc eptance among judicial actors with international norms. On the other, the use of ICL and human rights law in the dictatorship -era cases garners resistance even for new legislation from members of society who fear retroactive application of norms, who are t ired of hearing about the human rights violations of the dictatorship, and who associate the issue with the left. As one Supreme Court Justice put it, \"the issue of human rights has been tied to the crimes of the dictatorship . . . there are today . . . it has complicated matters for to the issue of human rights.\"237 V. Minister (\"en general yo creo que [lo de] las violaciones de los derechos humanos abri\u00f3 el camino para la protecci\u00f3n de otros derechos humanos... o sea primero fueron las violaciones de derechos humanos en la \u00e9poca de dictadura. Despu\u00e9s llegamos a todo lo que es de violaciones de derech os humanos por via de discriminaci\u00f3n, por ejemplo. Ahora estamos en la hoja importante de todo lo que es violencia de g\u00e9nero.
