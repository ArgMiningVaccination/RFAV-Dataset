BSWRI provides the critical operational resources needed to safely and effectively conduct research a range of protocols, medical Serving 800,000 people at medical centers across our healthcare system - Publishing more than 500 peer reviewed publications per year Our patients and community members are at the heart of everything we do at BSWRI A key aspect of delivering high quality, patient-centered From health and other trends that improve quality of care, we are committed to bringing innovation to the forefront of healthcare by diverse our serves. Frequently published in major scientific journals and reported at medical and scientific meetings, our research has resulted more research by following: How you can participate in clinical research We the wide range of medical specialties. By taking part in a clinical trial, you can play a more active role in your own healthcare and help others by contributing to medical research. Baylor Scott & White Research Institute undertakes clinical trials in both North Texas and Central Texas. To see if you qualify for enrollment in one of and insights that can treatments and medications that could help future generations. Taking part in research can also present patients who have attempted other treatments or are looking for other options with a choice not otherwise available to the general public because the medications and therapies involved are still being evaluated. But research at Baylor Scott & White is about more than just seeing how we can treat cancer. We have studies that seek to find better ways to detect and prevent cancer in patients who have never had it, may have a family history of it, or are worried about their cancer coming back. We also study how cancer progresses in different individuals and under different circumstances, such as when other health conditions are involved. And we have trials that seek to find ways to improve the quality of life for people who are living with cancer or who have just completed their treatment. Participation in research can help inform every aspect of a patient's cancer and other research a new treatment or therapy, factors such as safety, side effects and basic effectiveness are a natural part of the evaluation. As such, participants may experience an adverse response or run the risk of the treatment or therapy having no effect at all. These factors are all discussed with patients in advance of and patients are closely monitored throughout the process to watch for any such signs. - Am I guaranteed to get a drug or would I get a placebo? Not all trials involve the use of a placebo. If the trial you are considering does involve placebos, a research team member will discuss this information and related details with you prior to as part of your initial screening. - What do I have to do to qualify? Every research opportunity has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria that help determine if a person qualifies for the study. Research team members review these criteria with interested participants as part of an initial screening. Criteria can include general information like your age, as well as more detailed factors, such as the stage of cancer you have or other health conditions or procedures in your medical history. - What are the costs involved in a clinical trial? Every trial is different, but generally participants do not have to pay for costs tied to the treatments or medications involved in the These costs are generally covered by the trial's sponsor(s). The patient any routine testing, procedures medications they take as part of their existing cancer treatment. As part of the trial, a BSWRI team member will review study consent forms with you and provide information about what payments you are and are not responsible for making. Research participation can require more participant is used to having. This is needed as part of the monitoring and study process, but may require will be advance with participants as part of the enrollment process. - Once I join a trial, am I required to stay enrolled? No, you can stop participating in a clinical trial at any time and for any reason. You are not required to stay enrolled under any circumstances. - What are the different phases of research? There are different types of studies and trials involved in research. Some focus on data collection and observation, or studying tissue and tumor samples. These types of studies generally require less time from patient the evaluation of a new drug, or combination drugs, or a new therapy or treatment approach. Below is a breakdown of these phases as explained U.S. Food and and that emphasize safety. The goal is to find out what the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events are and, in or For example, compared receiving a different treatment, usually an inactive substance (called a placebo) or a different drug. Safety continues to be about effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and post-market studies are to by the sponsor. These studies gather additional information about a drug's safety, efficacy, or optimal use. Baylor Scott & White Research Institute currently supports research within each of the different phases and categories mentioned above. Areas of research All of Us Research Program The All of Us Research Program is a large research program. The goal is to help researchers understand more about why people get sick or stay healthy. People who join will give us information about their health, habits, and what it's like where they live. By looking at patterns, researchers may learn more about what affects people's health. Baylor Scott & White Health is a proud participant of the All of Us Research Program, from the National Institute of Health.

Antibodies: What are they and how are they used in COVID-19 research and treatment? Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, the term \"antibodies\" was tucked into the various conversations about vaccines and treatment options that swirled through public and scientific communities alike. Could they help treat the sick? When could they be retrieved from recovered COVID-19 patients? How should they be administered?
