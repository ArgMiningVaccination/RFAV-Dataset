La causa del uso es multifactorial, pero se destacan factores de riesgo y precipitantes como la carga horaria de la curr\u00edcula, exigencias de estudio, el distr\u00e9s por el afrontamiento cadav\u00e9rico negativo, el nuevo contexto educativo y la cantidad de horas de sue\u00f1o. El objetivo fue comparar la prevalencia de uso de SP entre las cohortes de 2011-2019, con focalizaci\u00f3n en los factores determinantes conductuales. Estudio observacional, transversal y comparativo mediante encuesta estandarizada y an\u00f3nima en 945 alumnos (a\u00f1o 2011= 122; a\u00f1o 2013= 158; a\u00f1o 2015=204; a\u00f1o 2017= 228; a\u00f1o 2019= 233). Se aplicaron par\u00e1metros estad\u00edsticos, se defini\u00f3 la significaci\u00f3n como p -0.84; AA: r> -0.71).

En las cohortes comparadas por el lapso de 9 a\u00f1os hallamos alta prevalencia de uso de sustancias psicoactivas con tendencia al incremento. Las variables actividad laboral y recursante fueron determinantes para el uso de sustancias, y se asociaron cuestiones relativas a la adaptabilidad universitaria y afrontamiento de estudio negativo con el cad\u00e1ver; todos con incidencia pedag\u00f3gica en el proceso de ense\u00f1anza y aprendizaje. SUMMARY: In preliminary studies, we observed a high students or those with work activities. The cause of use is multifactorial, but risk and precipitating factors stand out, such as the workload of study demands, to coping, the new educational context and the number of hours of sleep. The objective was to compare the prevalence of SP use between the 2011-2019 cohorts, a on comparative study using as -0.71). In the case of benzodiazepine anxiolytics, it was associated with lack of sleep and distress due to negative coping with the study with cadavers. In the cohorts compared for a period of 9 years, we found a high prevalence of psychoactive substance use with an increasing trend. The variables work activity and recurrence were determinants for the use of substances, and issues related to university adaptability and negative study coping with the corpse were associated; all with pedagogical study was to determine whether the pandemic has reinforced that impact. This is a cross-sectional study using an online survey 2,344 of help (33.2%), by increasing citizenship values (28.4%), and to improving the situation of the country (27.5%).

For students under psychological distress, at a statistically significant level. CONCLUSION: It was some medical students were suffering from psychological difficulties related to COVID-19, and were several risk factors for them. This finding suggests that medical schools need to not only develop academic management systems but also provide programs that can students manage their life satisfaction and depressive and anxiety symptoms among the capital (PsyCap), a positive psychological state, mediated life and anxiety among cross-sectional survey was at three medical universities in China. life satisfaction and depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Life satisfaction was positively associated with PsyCap and its four components. There were significant negative associations between life and anxiety symptoms. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study, and causal relationships between the variables could not be ascertained. Self-reported questionnaire instruments were used for data collection, which may have recall bias. CONCLUSIONS: Life satisfaction and PsyCap can be to and optimism) anxiety the internet, smartphones, and social media among medical students and relationship experienced classes for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic. For some individuals, greater online engagement can lead to online dependency, which can be associated with depression. The present study explored the association between problematic use of the internet, social media, and smartphones with depression symptoms among Ugandan medical students. medical students at a Ugandan public university. a survey, data collected regarding socio-demographic factors, lifestyle, online use behaviors, smartphone media and internet addiction. Hierarchical linear regression models were performed to explore the associations forms of symptom severity. RESULTS: The indicated moderate to severe depression symptoms. The prevalence of being at risk of (i) smartphone addiction was 45.72%, (ii) social media addiction was 74.34%, and (iii) internet addiction use was 8.55%. Online use behaviors (e.g., average hours spent online, types of social media platforms used, the purpose for internet use) and online-related addictions (to smartphones, social media, and the internet) predicted approximately 8% and 10% of the severity of depression symptoms, respectively. However, over the past two weeks, life stressors had the highest predictability for depression (35.9%). The final model predicted a total of 51.9% variance for depression symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: The exploration of knowledge and attitudes about vaccinations, and the analysis of the characteristics of these factors according to gender, year and vaccine willingness/hesitancy among medical students at the University of Szeged. METHOD: The cross-sectional study was conducted among first and fourth year medical students of the University, using an online questionnaire, which examined, in addition to sociodemographic the administration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations, the self-assessment of knowledge about vaccinations, the opinions about recommended vaccinations. RESULTS: Based on the definition of WHO Strategic Advisory Group, 88.6% of the students belonged to the \"vaccine willingness\" group, who administered the vaccine against COVID-19 as soon as it became available, while the \"vaccine hesitancy\" group (11.4%) only asked for the vaccine when vaccination was made mandatory or not even then. According to the model adjusted to gender and year, those who showed willingness to vaccinate were more likely to consider the use of vaccinations, counselling, etc. important than those who were hesitant, while there was no correlation with the self-rating of knowledge. On the basis of the odds ratio of the statements related to recommended vaccinations, it was possible opinions associated with vaccine willingness or DISCUSSION: Overall, student knowledge and attitudes showed a positive picture.
