Indeed, the development of honey-based adhesives for wound care and other biomedical applications are topics being widely investigated over the years. Some of the advantages of the use of honey for wound-healing solutions are the acceleration of dermal repair and epithelialization, angiogenesis promotion, immune response promotion and the reduction in healing-related infections with pathogenic microorganisms. This paper reviews the main role of honey on the development of wound-healing-based applications, the main compounds responsible for the healing capacity, how the honey origin can influence the healing properties, also highlighting promising results in in vitro and in vivo trials. The challenges in the use of honey for wound healing are also covered and discussed. The delivery methodology (direct application, incorporated in fibrous membranes and hydrogels) is also presented and discussed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-08-07", "cleaned_text": "that can last from several weeks until some months, or even more time in the case of the existence of some co-morbidities or particular patient situations [ [4](#B4-molecules-26-04784)]. In the end, during the maturation the new tissues are remodeled, is [ [6](#B6-molecules-26-04784)]. In the end, this of wound can cause sepsis and inflammation different antibacterial action mechanisms, the development of bacterial resistance to [8](#B8-molecules-26-04784), these act liquid layer between the dressing and the wound bed. This liquid layer is an advantage in the removal and change of wound-dressings by reducing or eliminating the pain of this of a quick of from around Honey in and [8](#B8-molecules-26-04784)]. Honey and in influenced by its composition, which depends mainly on the floral and other factors, such as seasonal, environmental, as well as processing, and storage [25](#B25-molecules-26-04784), [26](#B26-molecules-26-04784)]. In addition to and osmotic pressure, healing properties of honey in diverse types of wounds and burns have also been attributed to other components which act through different mechanisms that work together to restore the gradually decreased. Nowadays, microbial drug-resistance become an has addition, since bacteria do not respond to the therapy or are protected by a self-produced biofilms expression of different genes related to the formation and the development of biofilms [ [48](#B48-molecules-26-04784), [49](#B49-molecules-26-04784)], and Anti-Inflammatory as pain. The in prostaglandin concentration in plasma may induce pain exudate with an appropriate moisture balance, which is still a constant challenge healing processes [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-04784)].

However, until found the level of anti-inflammatory activity in different honey samples and the phenolic compound content [ [58](#B58-molecules-26-04784)], which might be due to the distinct types of interactions that can occur among these compounds capacity interfere in the chain reactions of free radicals and can play a preventative role in the process of their formation antioxidant [ [64](#B64-molecules-26-04784)]. The extended exposure to ROS causes damage tissue delay which produce fibers of scar tissue. If the inflammatory phase prolongates, it could induce hyper-granulation and that activated by the hydrogen peroxide produced [ of wound surface, does not digest the collagen matrix, PAI, so the mechanism through which honey decreases the production of PAI is probably related an in vitro study with analogues of angiogenesis an endothelial proliferation [ [68](#B68-molecules-26-04784)], study [ [69](#B69-molecules-26-04784)].

In addition, the high concentration of sugars present in honey, as as local cellular which may highest pro-angiogenic effect was and destroy the plasma fibronectin and the collagen matrix, which are for makes (IL-1) levels. A concentration of 1% of honey has been found to stimulate the release of the cytokine TNF-, IL-1 and migration and proliferation, which are the major cellular are involved in the treatment [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-04784)]. In addition, the absence of standardization and the incomplete knowledge of the active components, and the mechanisms through which they interact and act in wound healing, are the major limitations for the application of honey in medicine. For this reason, is essential to select the more appropriate varieties of honey, and it is recommended to carry previous screening necessary to is a risk of wound infection, mainly related to the presence of clostridial spores have occasionally been found in honey [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-04784), [84](#B84-molecules-26-04784)]. This risk can be reduced by using related to the use of non-irradiated honey on have been reported to date. [8](#B8-molecules-26-04784), In addition, necessary to consider that of honey might present active nectar ingestion [ [87](#B87-molecules-26-04784), [88](#B88-molecules-26-04784)]. 4. Biomedical Application of Honey in Advanced Wound Care 4.1. Medical Grade Honey and Honey aim kill Clostridium spores, produced standards in composition, and under potent vitro bactericidal activity antibiotic-resistant related to compounds which diluted by wound exudate, will still have potent enough antibacterial activity to inhibit the growth of bacteria (the MIC values were found to be below 11%). [90](#B90-molecules-26-04784)]. Most of them are formulated with medical-grade Manuka honey, since it is one of the most studied varieties of honey in the world, and it was the first honey type to obtain the status of medical-grade honey. However, there are also alternatives that use other types of honey, such as buckwheat, multifloral, and Revamil source honey, among others [ [8](#B8-molecules-26-04784)]. For instance, a honey-based gel formula can be prepared with 100 % medical-grade honey without the addition of other ingredient ( [Table 1](#molecules-26-04784-t001)) or can be Despite the availability of these products, their use in medical practice is still limited, probably due to the misconception that there is no evidence to support the use of honey with therapeutic purposes, as well as the scarce promotion Indeed, the use ointments help to entrap water, keep the skin moist, and provide an emollient protective film, which elements for wound healing [ [19](#B19-molecules-26-04784), [90](#B90-molecules-26-04784)], the rate of formation new tissue, a release of incorporated bioactive compounds (drugs), and affect the water absorption capacity [102](#B102-molecules-26-04784)].

It has been shown that the release honey increases when increasing in the best properties (regeneration of the tissue and the new blood capillaries) compared to honey hydrogel formulae with a lower concentration (up dressing hybrid hydrogel honey 24 h with progressively low adhesion to the wound bed [103](#B103-molecules-26-04784)]. with honey hydrogel sheets were is into a syringe that is attached to a needle of wounds. 30%: 7%:5.5 %) and showed poor antibacterial Pseudomonas Phage Treatment on Infected Antibiotics 2020, 9, Resistance?
