As men we have experienced fears of not being man enough, traumas associated with violence, unconscious grief as violence while trying to live up to the expectations of what others and ourselves have been told men are supposed to be. This has created a society where men feel isolated, alone, shamed, depressed, angry, anxious disconnected unhealthy toxic behaviors that perpetuate the suffering on the planet. I started this group because I want to share space, connect and support other men who are serious about healing themselves and the collective while supporting other men on their journey moving forward out of this outdated way of thinking that men are supposed to always be tough and not sensitive, men shouldn't cry, men must \"dominate\" women physically, sexually, and career-wise, not share emotions and compete with each other instead of support one another. This group is a safe container for support, growth and transformation. I am very passionate about drumming and ritual and I have experienced much healing on a deep level through the power of the drum and ritual. Sound healing, energy healing and connecting with nature and the Great Mother Earth have also been a big part of my life and healing journey and I am very excited to share what has worked for me with other men to support their healing and clearing of old toxic energies that are keeping them from moving forward without arrogance, emotional balance, self love, feeling connected source, spiritual, will power, strength without empathy and a healthy respect for oneself, others and the planet our great Mother Earth. These are all qualities that are healthy and much needed on the planet. Do you want to connect with other men who are ready to make the shift and do the deep hard work and support their brothers to make this a better planet. I have many tribe minded men's support passage and examining and healing our wounds. I will be starting with the sober men's intentional drum meditation gathering. If you are interested and this all sounds good and resonates with you, AWESOME! Join this group to be notified when these events will take place. This is also a sober group which i am very happy to facilitate. This includes no alcohol, cannabis or any other mind and or physically altering substances. Please respect this. I truly believe that it is very important for us to be in our own awareness and energy for true healing to occur. This is an amazing time we are in and more and more men are waking up and realizing that the old ways of doing things are just not working and truly wanting to connect with other healthy mindful men who want to heal themselves and the planet while supporting other men in the process. Healthy masculine connections are so important for men to be healthy and happy. The in person events will be held at a park or nature area (TBA per event) in the Clearwater Florida area. There will also be online events so you will be able to attend from anywhere in the world. I look forward to connecting with you. In Lak'ech Ala "}
