It is the most widely employed vaccine worldwide, although its efficacy is variable. BCG is also a powerful immunomodulating agent, which has opened up the possibilities of its use in the treatment of other diseases, particularly in the treatment of some types of cancer. After its approval in 1990, the BCG has been used as an effective treatment for bladder cancer. The mechanism by which it exerts its anticancer effect is still unknown, although it is probably based in the fact that the cells infected by the vaccine\u00b4s bacteria secrete a number of cytokines that lead to the destruction of the tumor cells. However, although BCG has been shown to delay the recurrence of bladder cancer, this treatment does not allow to achieve a complete cure of the disease. Besides its effectiveness in the treatment of bladder cancer, there are preclinical and clinical evidences of the potential usefulness of the BCG vaccine for other types of cancer, particularly in melanoma, gastric cancer and colon cancer.

Es la vacuna m\u00e1s administrada a nivel mundial, aunque su eficacia es variable. Pero la BCG es, adem\u00e1s, un potente agente inmunomodulador, lo que ha abierto las posibilidades de su uso en el tratamiento de otras enfermedades, en particular en el tratamiento de algunos tipos de c\u00e1ncer. As\u00ed, desde 1990 est\u00e1 aprobado el uso de la BCG como tratamiento para el c\u00e1ncer de vejiga. El mecanismo por el que ejerce su efecto anticanceroso es a\u00fan desconocido, aunque se intuye que las c\u00e9lulas infectadas por las bacterias de la vacuna secretan una serie de citoquinas que conducen a la destrucci\u00f3n de las c\u00e9lulas tumorales. Sin embargo, aunque la BCG ha demostrado retrasar notablemente la recurrencia del c\u00e1ncer de vejiga, este tratamiento no consigue una curaci\u00f3n total. Adem\u00e1s de su eficacia en el tratamiento del c\u00e1ncer de vejiga, existen evidencias precl\u00ednicas y cl\u00ednicas de la posible utilidad de la vacuna BCG en otros tipos de c\u00e1ncer, en particular en el melanoma, el c\u00e1ncer g\u00e1strico y el c\u00e1ncer de colon. En este trabajo se revisa la bibliograf\u00eda relativa al uso de la BCG como agente anticanceroso, as\u00ed como su posible aplicaci\u00f3n en otras terapias. "}
