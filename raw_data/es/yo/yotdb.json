The explanation was simple, but it had alarming implications for the nascent Spanish colony: Europeans did not thrive in the very different environment of the New World. The \"change in water and air,\" Columbus believed, was the principal cause of the dreadful ailments afflicting the of the New World environment and make feasible the dream of colonization. He was not alone in this belief. Columbus's assertion that European food was vital to of such settlements forms part of a vast current of discourse that links diet to discussions of Spanish health, Indian bodies, and overseas colonization. Diet was in fact central to the colonial endeavor. As we shall see, food played a fundamental and \"Indian\" that underpinned Spain's colonial universe in the early modern era. Beyond this, attending to food's place within that universe illuminates the profound but incompatible desires that characterized Spain's which sought simultaneously to make Amerindians like Europeans and to keep them separate. Many aspects of early modern colonial expansion proved unsettling for its European protagonists. and about the proper way Europeans to interact with these new peoples and places. Far from being an enterprise based on an unquestioning assumption of European superiority, early pursuit. This anxiety is captured most profoundly in the fear that living in an unfamiliar environment, and among unfamiliar peoples, might alter not bodies of settlers. Perhaps, might European body in less but equally unwelcome ways, so that it ultimately ceased to be a European body at all. Scholars have long recognized the challenges that unfamiliar climates, in particular, were believed pose to the European body, and lately several attempts have been made to link such early modern concerns about colonial environments to the emergence of racial ideologies. but the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the evolution of racial ideologies to revolutionized this chronology. descendants) articulated an early form of embodied racial discourse in their efforts to explain the supposedly different impact of the New World climate on Europeans and Amerindians. He asserts that that Europeans appeared to Ca\u00f1izares-Esguerra's attention to the significance of climate and indigenous health in the early colonial era has been mirrored in scholarship on England's North American colonies. Joyce Chaplin, in particular, has advanced similar arguments about the attitudes of English settlers in seventeenth-century argue that \"race\"\u2014a fixed, bodily condition\u2014began to emerge in the early colonial era as a result of Europeans' encounter with the New World's climate and inhabitants. [3](javascript:;) Such research highlights and helpfully refocuses attention on the fact early actors ascribed great significance to the differences they perceived between their of Amerindians. Nonetheless, it accords a disproportionate importance to climate as a challenge to the European body. Climate was but one of a number of forces believed by Europeans to affect health and character, and it does not assist our analysis of the early modern colonial experience to isolate climate from these other forces. In particular, we should not overlook the role of food. Food was in fact central to the early modern discourses about human difference that structured European efforts at Americas and their inhabitants. [4](javascript:;) When we attend to the place of food within these discourses, it becomes clear that fluidity, rather than fixity, was the hallmark of the early modern body, and that this fluidity had striking implications for the coherence of colonial ideology. Food shaped the colonial body in a number of ways. To begin with, the right foods protected Europeans from the challenges posed by the New World and its environment. Spaniards believed that they would not suffer from the excessive damp and dangerous heavens of the Americas if they ate European food. For this reason, colonizers and settlers in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish America means permanent. could be altered just as easily In other words, the role of diet is considered here not in the performance of European colonial identity, but rather in the construction and maintenance of the Spanish body. By probing the space that early modern Spaniards imagined to exist between their bodies and those of Amerindians, we can measure the distance that separated the one from the other and map the routes whereby one could begin to transform into the other, using a variety of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century sources. This chronological European understandings of the body, which a coherence in regard to ideas about corporeality notwithstanding the many transformations undergone by Spanish and colonial society during this period. [5](javascript:;) The many sources that illuminate this topic, which range medical handbooks legal treatises to and and were serve purposes, and we should not assume that they form part of a coherent corpus of discourse as regards their ostensible subjects. Nonetheless, one feature they share is a vision of the human body as essentially porous, in active dialogue with its environment. Indeed, it is precisely through the analysis of a range of disparate sources that we have the best opportunity to uncover early modern body concepts. The broader implications of these concepts can then be considered in light of the contradictory aims at the heart of early modern colonialism. Spaniards who traveled in the Indies in the early modern era quickly determined that Amerindian bodies differed from their of ways. Indians were somewhat darker-skinned and had distinctively straight hair, and men beards. In a proud nature, possessed light skin and climate, bodies, complexions, etc. of the Spaniards are different from those possessed by the Indians.\" [7](javascript:;) Learned men generally tenets of humoral theory. This made Amerindians similar to women, who were also believed to be although some event, everyone agreed they one of the reasons Indians and Spaniards were so different was that they lived in very different environments. Early modern medical thinking accorded a central role to in bodies. [10](javascript:;) Climate, for example, was thought to play a key part in determining skin color. The Spanish Dominican Gregorio Garc\u00eda, writing in the early seventeenth century, explained that Ethiopians had dark skin, although they were, like all men, the sons of Noah (who was presumed to have been white), because they lived in the heat of the torrid zone. \"There is nothing new in men changing the color of their body, and their hair, in conformity with the climate of the region where they live,\" he observed. [11](javascript:;) In addition to provoking changes in and hair color, climate was also believed to affect individual health. As a consequence, educated Spaniards living in the Americas were highly attuned to the potential impact of the air, stars, and temperature, which were liable to provoke all sorts of undesirable This fear was well expressed by the Spanish physician Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez, who in the 1570s served as New Spain's protom\u00e9dico, or chief medical officer. \"Let us hope that the men who are born [in Europe] and who begin to occupy those regions, whether their parents are Spanish or of different nations, do not in obedience to the heavens degenerate to the point of adopting the customs of the Indians,\" he noted in his study of New World materia medica. [12](javascript:;) The clearest evidence for the deleterious impact of the provided by all European writers of the time believed that Amerindians had at some point in the past migrated to the Americas from the Old World. The precise place of origin and the mode of transport remained in dispute, but Christian teaching made it clear that all men were descended from a common ancestor. Hence it was important to explain why people who had originated in the Old World now differed so much from the Spanish in both behavior and appearance. For example, Spaniards asked themselves, an extensive discussion of this question, Gregorio Garc\u00eda hypothesized that the hot, moist climate of the New World impeded the growth of facial hair. This raised the terrifying prospect that the Spanish, too, might lose their prized beards as a result of living in the same environment. (Beards were considered a signal mark of manhood by early modern Spaniards. Writers insisted that they were a gift from God to beautify and adorn the male face.) [13](javascript:;) Yet help was at hand. Garc\u00eda explained that this alarming possibility was in fact the \"temperance and virtue that the Spaniards born in the Indies inherited from their fathers and grandfathers\" were continually reinforced through the consumption of Spanish food. Their constitution, he explained, was protected by \"good foods and sustenance such as lamb, chicken, turkey, and good beef, [wheat] bread, and wine, and nourishing foods.\" [14](javascript:;) This long list consists almost entirely of Old World foods that had been lacking in the New World before the arrival of Europeans. Indians therefore could not possibly have protected their beards from the destructive effects of the American climate, all the more so given that the foods that were available were singularly inadequate, consisting as they did of cassava, and other foods \"of very little nourishment.\" [15](javascript:;) It was through eating this inadequate food, as much as through the impact of the climate, that the Indians had lost their Old World temperament. The result was the disappearance of their beards. Climate was thus important in shaping bodies, but so too was diet. The Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, who after many years' residence in the Caribbean composed a lengthy \"official\" history of the New World in the mid-sixteenth century, explained this clearly when regions, and with such different foods.\" [16](javascript:;) Food could not be separated from throughout the sixteenth and centuries from other climates through [eating] new foods generate new blood, which [create] new abilities and conditions.\" [17](javascript:;) A change in food, like a change in climate, was liable to provoke a change in both body and character. Food, in other words, helped distinguish Spaniard from Indian, but it of an on the principles of humoral theory. Learned thinking in the early modern period held that good health required a balance of the four humors that governed the body: blood, phlegm, black bile, and bile, each of which was associated with relative degrees of heat, cold, dryness, and moisture. Individuals humoral \"complexion,\" a term character and their bodily qualities. Each person was born with a particular complexion, but a variety of external forces could alter one's humoral balance. Climate (\"air\") was one of them; food was another. These, together with levels of exercise, sleep and wakefulness, evacuation (which included things\" whose modern scholars regarded as profound. [18](javascript:;) This significance cosmographer Henrico Mart\u00ednez, who spent a number of years in Mexico City in the late sixteenth century. In his 1606 Reportorio de los tiempos e historia natural desta Nueva Espa\u00f1a, Mart\u00ednez asked why it was that people living under the same stars might have different complexions. The answer, he explained, was was determined by many factors, including diversity themselves,\" different exercise regimes, and different emotional states, not mention the fact that it tended to alter during the course of an individual's life. These factors together explained the great variety in complexions and characters within a single locale. [19](javascript:;) and damp, improve their condition by eating hot, dry foods such as black pepper. Melancholics (cold and dry, and governed by black bile) were advised to eat hot, moist foods such as sugar. A change in diet, like a change in environment, could transform an individual complexion. Such transformations, however, were for instance, was held to have expired in 1463 as a direct result of drinking excessive of cold water, which phlegmatic Only with great use other a \"second nature.\" The human body was in a state of constant flux; the complexion needed Moreover, because of the influence of food and air on the human constitution, bodies, far from being hermetically sealed off from the outside world, were continually open to the impact of their external environment. \"All bodies are Transpirable and Trans-fluxible, that is, so open to the ayre as that it may easily passe and repasse through them,\" noted the as Gail Kern Paster has observed in her study of humoralism in early modern England, \"solubility\" was the \"sine qua of Amerindians first migrated to the Indies. Humoral Europeans, bodies were inherently unstable and mutable. Travel to new environments\u2014whether to a different city or a different continent\u2014which subjected the body to unfamiliar individual health. Sixteenth-century English travelers in Spain fretted about the impact of alien airs and foods in much the same manner as did Spanish settlers in the Caribbean. [22](javascript:;) Any change in location, in other words, could easily place an individual's health at risk. It is little wonder that Spanish settlers in the Indies worried about their diet. Humoral theory thus provided a model bodies and the bodies of Spaniards resident in the Indies were different, despite the common environment. They differed because they lived under different exercise regimes (Indians acknowledged to be more active), and, critically, because they ate different foods. [23](javascript:;) This view was offered as an ad hoc explanation for the Indian character from the earliest days of the conquest. The inhabitants of the Caribbean, noted the Italian Michele da Cuneo, who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, were \"cold people, not very lustful, which is perhaps a result their poor from Indians was explained with great clarity by Diego Andr\u00e9s Rocha in his 1681 treatise on the \"origin of the Indians.\" Rocha, a Spaniard who taught law at the Peruvian University of San Marcos and also served on the Audiencia de Lima, advanced the view that Amerindians were descended from ancient Spaniards who had traveled to the New World in the remote past. Given their common origin, Rocha needed to explain why it was that Amerindians now differed so dramatically from Spaniards. He argued places, provided living proof not Old World might undergo dramatic transformations in the New World, but that Spaniards, in particular, could turn into Indians. caused this change in color, size, gestures, and faces among Americans, who did not conserve the color of the first Spaniards who came to these Indies ... because their ancestors enjoyed different climates, different waters, different foods, which at first were not very nourishing, and it was a great achievement that they did not die of hunger until such time as they managed to cultivate fruits and other forms of food, and this is what caused the variation among peoples by the new climate, but rather by \"the lack of protection from the weather, bad foods, and over a long period.\" For this reason alone, creoles\u2014people of European heritage born in the Indies\u2014remained white despite their lengthy residence in the New World. In any their raised with much care and protection and with good foods, which was not the case with the Indians and those who first came to this America.\" [26](javascript:;) Good food trumped climate. A change in climate could thus be managed through careful attention to diet, but the converse could not be said for a change in diet. The latter, Rocha stressed, could have devastating consequences for the individual complexion, and for this reason it was essential for creoles and Europeans living in the Indies to eat appropriately. Eating the wrong food and living unprotected in the American environment had turned ancient Spaniards into and repeat the mistakes of their ancestors. \"Here we have seen very white men from Spain,\" Rocha wrote, \"who, on withdrawing into the hills and eating maize and other Indian dainties, return so toasted that they resemble Indians.\" [27](javascript:;) As Rocha explained, food was vital to maintaining the distance between Spaniards (and creoles) and Indians. to would turn into words, was in part a question These fell they could not eat familiar foods, and conversely asserted that only the restoration of their usual diet would heal them. Recall Columbus's 1494 letter monarchs. The admiral's son Ferdinand similarly insisted that the Spanish settlers in the Caribbean were \"made ill by the climate and diet of that country.\" [28](javascript:;) Such views were widely shared by other In his own discussion of the disastrous settlement on Hispaniola, Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo agreed that the high European death toll was due primarily to the change in diet. He summed up the dangerous features of the New World as follows: Unlike medically trained writers, Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo did not frame his analysis with references to Galen or Hippocrates. beyond the incongruity that the heavens there have with those of Europe (where we were born), and the influence of the differences in the airs and vapors and nature of the land, we found no foods in these parts that were like those that our fathers gave us: the bread\u2014of roots, the our the different flavor, the meats\u2014there were none on [Hispaniola], beyond those mute rodents or a few other animals, and all very different from those of Spain. [29] [30](javascript:;)Rather, he presented his observations as the outcome of firsthand experience in the New World, which had taught him that the air, water, and food of the Americas were not suited to European unhealthy and dangerous (at for Europeans). These claims were made despite the fact that maize and other New World starches clearly formed comment that they provisioned themselves and other New World staples seized from locals; indeed, failure to provide expeditionary parties with food was accepted as a legitimate reason for attacking an indigenous village. Beyond this, there is a wealth of evidence that from the earliest days of settlement, Spaniards drank atole (a another of early Spanish settlements in Florida, for example, the remains of a of diary of Felipe de Hutten, a German who participated in the conquest of Venezuela in the 1530s, indicates that his party relied on maize seized from locals for their food, but when a number of his companions fell ill, he recorded bitterly that maize and cassava were \"damaging not only to the sick, but also to the healthy who are not such food.\" [33](javascript:;) Medical in Spain presumably drew on the reports of such men for their own pronouncements about the dangers posed by New World foods. Francisco Nu\u00f1ez de Oria, for example, recorded in his 1586 dietary manual that \"the root called cassava, from which the Indians make bread, is mortal poison to those from these parts who navigate over there.\" they relied upon them for nourishment. [35](javascript:;) Even when it did not induce illness, reliance on a wholly indigenous diet was apt to provoke profound changes in the individual constitution, as was revealed by the experiences of the Spaniard Jer\u00f3nimo de Aguilar. Aguilar had been shipwrecked off the Yucatan Peninsula in 1511 and lived with local Maya Indians until his rescue by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in 1519. Following his return to Spanish society, he was offered European food, but to the surprise of his rescuers, he ate only sparingly. When asked why he was so moderate, he explained that \"after so much time he was accustomed to the food of the Indians, and his stomach would regard Christian food as foreign.\" Indians had to tolerate normal digestive had gone in humoral terms, had acquired a \"second nature,\" and as a result, his body was not quite as Christian as it had been prior to his shipwreck. He had begun to turn into an Indian. A diet based on New World foods was thus by medically less individuals, whatever their demonstrated the sad consequences on American foodstuffs. For reason, Spaniards went to great lengths to obtain health-giving Old World foods, in particular the Iberian trinity of wheat bread, wine, and olive oil, together meats such as lamb, beef, and pork. [37](javascript:;) Wheat bread and wine were central Iberian diet, and also played bread occupied a significant place within humoral medicine, as it was generally held to be the most nutritious food. Wine, in turn, was regarded as supremely healthy, provided that it was drunk in moderation. Beyond this, wheat bread and wine played a central role in the Catholic ritual of communion. From the that communion be celebrated in his thirteenth-century Summa this sacrament wheaten only wine from the grape.\" He explicitly ruled the use of other grains their frequent [38](javascript:;) Catholic Eucharist was thus clear: only wheat bread and grape wine had the potential to become the body and blood of Christ. Moreover, in the Iberian Peninsula, wine possessed an additional Catholic for Islamic forbade the consumption wine therefore served aspired to represent. These foods\u2014along with a host of lesser ingredients, such as the chickpeas, melons, and radishes that Columbus carried with him on voyage\u2014were thus important to the success were Indians, and individual explorers in face of considerable contrary evidence\u2014that they sickened when deprived of their familiar diet. For these reasons, Columbus had requested that his men be provisioned with supplies from Spain. He recognized, however, that to survive. Attempts to grow wheat and other staples were made from the 1490s, and European livestock were introduced in both the Caribbean and the American mainland from the earliest days of Spanish settlement. [40](javascript:;) Crown officials were to determine which Old World plants grew well in the New World, and in particular whether \"wheat, barley, wine explicitly on writers detailed the Old World crops that did and did not thrive in particular regions. Cuneo, who had attributed the Caribbean phlegmatic nature their reported his sponsors that \"for your information, we brought with us from Spain some of every kind of seed, and we planted them all, and determined which do well and reveal quickly \"We are very certain, as experience has shown, that both wheat and wine will grow well in this land,\" insisted Columbus two years after his landfall in the Caribbean, although this statement cannot have been based on much actual evidence. [44](javascript:;) in both Mexico and Peru regularly recorded wheat yields of more than a hundred measures for every one sown at a time when typical Spanish yields were about of [Hispaniola], which I can hardly repeat without blushing: say that radishes, lettuce, and squash mature within thirty-six days, that vines produce grapes in a year, and that wheat (they were determined to try everything), planted attempts to introduce their crops into the New World, for the ability of Old World plants to flourish in the New World closely mirrored the ability of Old World people to flourish there. Of course, Spaniards needed to eat nourishing Old World foods if they were to retain their health and their Spanish complexion. It was this pressing need for European foods that led settlers in the Indies, as elsewhere, to attempt to \"Europeanize\" the colonial landscape, to use Alfred Crosby's terminology, by introducing Old World plants and animals. [47](javascript:;) In addition, because Old World plants responded to the same climatic forces as did Spaniards, they functioned as a litmus test for the Spanish colonial venture: If they thrived, Spaniards were also likely to unclear whether overseas settlement could endure. [48](javascript:;) It was for this reason that Spaniards emphasized the ease with which Old World plants grew the Indies. they explicitly cultivation of Iberian crops with the providential nature of the discovery and colonization of the Americas. The abundance and fertility of Old World crops indicated clearly that divine forces looked favorably on Spain's in the New World. \"In what other land,\" asked Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo, Such abundance was used by some writers to adduce that the New World was in fact the location of the Garden of Eden. This fertility, which meant that \"whatever fruits are brought from Spain, and as many as are taken from Europe ... grow with such beyond doubt, in the opinion of the creole writer Agust\u00edn de Vetancurt, \"that the Terrestrial Paradise is hidden in some part of this region.\" Other writers, beginning with Columbus, entertained similar suppositions. has one heard or known that in such a short period, and in lands so far from our Europe, so much livestock and produce\u2014introduced here from across such wide seas\u2014should be produced, and in such abundance as is seen by our own eyes in these Indies? These lands have received [these crops] not as but as the truest mother, truer even than the one who sent them, for some of them grow better here than in Spain. [49] [50](javascript:;)The Americas, an earthly paradise, welcomed the Spanish by providing them with abundant supplies of their own foodstuffs, so as to ensure their health and well-being. Settlers could thus retain their Spanish complexion whatever the rigors of the climate. Indeed, the very climate was said to be undergoing a process of transformation to make it more suitable for European bodies. Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo reported that since Europeans had arrived in the Americas, the climate in the areas of Spanish settlement was becoming milder. In his view, this was because the European presence moderated and improved the men,\" he Their opinion was that \"the region and its rudeness are being dominated and tamed by Spanish dominion, just as occurs with the Indians and natives and animals and all the rest of this land.\" [51](javascript:;) Not only were Europeans protected against the dangerous effects of the American climate by the fecundity of Old World crops, but the climate of the many new foods that greeted Europeans on their arrival in the Americas? Settlers suspected that they fell ill when they relied on a diet of New World staples, but was any encounter with these new foodstuffs invariably by Amerindians, and on occasion drew explicit comparisons between the incivility of the food and that of the people who ate it. The fruit of the mangrove tree was in Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo's view \"a bestial food fit for and fried. Nothing living escapes their gullet, and what is all the more amazing is that they eat such bugs and dirty animals when they have good bread and wine, fruit, fish and meat,\" remarked the chronicler Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara in 1552, after the Spanish had introduced their superior foodstuffs. [53](javascript:;) As Anthony Pagden observed, the inability to distinguish the edible was sure all New World foods, and a number of items met with a very positive reception. Pineapples were universally admired, chile peppers were approved those with strong stomachs, and by the late sixteenth century, cacao, in the form of chocolate, was widely consumed. Indeed, it was Spaniards who introduced tomatoes to South America and chiles to Florida. A variety of New World meats were similarly praised by settlers and chroniclers. World were for Europeans to consume. Avocado, for example, was reported to be a \"very good and healthy for Spaniards to eat.\" writers, conclusions. [57](javascript:;) Beyond this, despite the suspicion with which maize and other New World starches were viewed, it was impossible for of the cacao, puddings made of Indian maize, with a bit of fowl or fresh pork in them seasoned with much red biting chilli,\" and Spanish and creole settlers alike. [58](javascript:;) Spaniards not only ate these foods in the Indies, but also in a number of cases introduced them into the Peninsula, so that by the end of the sixteenth century, chiles, tomatoes, and maize were a familiar sight in Spain itself. [59](javascript:;) Given the important role that World foods played in the diet of most settlers, it is not surprising that writers sometimes found positive things to say not only about pineapples but also about maize or cassava. The Franciscan bishop of Yucat\u00e1n, Diego de Landa, for instance, noted that maize bread was \"good and healthy, except that it is bad to eat cold.\" [60](javascript:;) In like fashion, the protom\u00e9dico Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez praised maize as a healthy and useful food. [61](javascript:;) in Dominican friar Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas stated on one page of his sixteenth-century Historia de las Indias that \"Indian bread\" was healthier than wheat bread, and on another it made settlers ill. [62](javascript:;) And despite his assertions that maize \"generated reason behind the devastating epidemic of cocoliztli that struck Mexico City in 1576. [63](javascript:;) As for pineapples and avocados, chroniclers insisted that [64](javascript:;) Europeans thus fluctuated in their views about how much of the new American environment they could incorporate into their own bodies, and by extension into their culture. This uncertainty particularly clearly in their New World carbohydrates such as cassava and potatoes. On the one hand, Spanish quickly substances to own. Maize, wrote the sixteenth-century Jesuit chronicler Jos\u00e9 de Acosta, of [65](javascript:;) Many described from maize, sweet potato as \"bread,\" regardless of comparisons wheat bread in Catholicism through its role in the communion service: bread is the substance that becomes the body of Christ. Acosta's comments on the similarities between New and gave wheat, which is the chief nourishment of man, and to the hemisphere of the Indies he gave maize, which holds second place after wheat for the sustenance of men and animals.\" [67](javascript:;) The identification of wheat with maize extended to the language of Christian prayer. \"May You give us now our daily tortillas,\" reads a Nahuatl translation of the Lord's Prayer from 1634. [68](javascript:;) On the other hand, perhaps the most characteristic feature of maize and other New World starches was precisely that they were not wheat. Maize, that foodstuff that harmed \"not only the sick also the was not merely dangerous when in quantity; it had also been declared incapable of transformation into the body of Christ. New World catechisms followed practice in stressing the necessity (and grape a 1687 Venezuelan catechism offered a clear is the Eucharist consecrated?\" The response was \"of true bread, made with wheat flour and water, and of true wine from grapes.\" [69](javascript:;) The vacillation between the views that maize was bread and that it was not bread can be seen in the linguistic inconstancy of Acosta's comment that his chronicle would show \"what sort of bread there is in the Indies and what they use in place of bread.\" [70](javascript:;) It is tempting to construct a parallel between European uncertainty over whether maize was or was not bread and the larger question of whether or not the Indians were men. The news that a previously unknown people had been found in the Americas prompted an intense debate in Europe about the nature of the Indians, and more specifically their capacity to become Christians. The question was ostensibly settled in 1537 when Paul III issued a bull declaring that \"the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to exceedingly to receive it.\" Nonetheless, humanist scholar Juan Gin\u00e9s for example, attracted considerable support for his thesis that the Amerindians were natural slaves of the sort described by Aristotle. They were, he \"homunculi Amerindians were \"men in our shape\" or some other sort of being. [73](javascript:;) Bread or not bread; men or not men? We would not be alone in positing a connection between these foods and the people who ate them, for colonial culture itself equated breads were in essence identical to Old World breads. In the late sixteenth century, certain New World churchmen the communion arguing that maize, too, could serve as the basis for the host. [75](javascript:;) become other, incapable of into just as the ersatz \"breads\" of native culture could never be transformed into the true body of Christ. Such parallels between the introduction of European foods and European religion shaped the imaginations of colonial actors in the early modern era. The evangelization of the New World was often compared to agricultural Christianizing the uprooting the weeds that had flourished prior to the arrival wholesome European crops. \"will we succeed in teaching these Indians to know the true God if we do not first eradicate and totally remove from their memory their superstitions, ceremonies, and false cults to the false gods whom they worship, just as it is not possible to grow a good field of wheat in mountainous and shrubby soil if you have not first completely removed all the roots and growths that it [76](javascript:;) These injunctions Europeans were constantly enjoined by crown not only to the but also to plant wheat and vines possible. Yet what were the Indians supposed to eat? If their roots were to be replaced with fields of wheat, what then would official stationed in Guatemala wrote to the Spanish monarchs to describe the ambitions of the small colonial outpost that he headed. His intention, he in the mid-sixteenth century compiled a vast encyclopedia of life in pre-conquest Mexico, was forth explicitly. Indians would become like the Spanish were they to eat their foods. that which the Castilian people eat, because it is good food, that with which they are raised, they are strong and pure and wise ... You will become the same way if you eat their food, and if you are careful with your bodies as they are. Raise Castilian maize [wheat] so that bread]. Raise sheep, pigs, cattle, for their flesh is good. May you not eat the flesh of dogs, mice, skunks, etc. For it is not edible. You will not eat what the Castilian people do not eat, for they know well what is edible. [78] Similar assertions were made by another sixteenth-century writer, who commented that as a result of eating a specifically and sheltering from the elements, the indigenous inhabitants of the Mexican village of a been given beef and pork and lamb to eat, and wine to drink, and they now live under roofs,\" he wrote. [79](javascript:;) Just as a diet of inadequate New World had transformed the Indians into the pusillanimous, phlegmatic beings they now so foods would restore the healthful European lost over the centuries. The Spanish jurist Juan de Sol\u00f3rzano Pereira explained clearly the connection between diet and the current condition of the Indians in his 1639 justification of Spain's American empire, De Indiarum Jure. The noted, were savage not \"from birth or lineage from place,\" but rather from \"a depraved education over a long span of time and from the practice, harshness and lack of instructions in their way of life and from the poor quality of the food they consume.\" basic Indians were advised to European yet medical thinking a of diet could have devastating consequences for an individual's constitution. blamed for illness among European settlers in the New World. If it was so dangerous for Europeans to eat Indian food, what would happen to Indians who ate European food? fall In believed that it was that afflicted Amerindians after the advent of colonization. In Hispaniola, the wave of epidemics that nearly exterminated the Taino people was blamed at in part on their adoption of European dietary habits, just as the ill health afflicting Spanish settlers on the same island was attributed to the consumption of New World foods. [81](javascript:;) Likewise, the Spanish geographer Fern\u00e1ndez they to other places and given meat to eat.\" [82](javascript:;) Juan de C\u00e1rdenas offered similar explanations as to why the Chichimec Indians, who in their own environment were hardy and robust, sickened and died when incorporated into colonial society. He their mortality to various causes, first among them \"the change in food, in that they are deprived of the natural sustenance on which they were raised, which, although it is very bad in itself, is for them healthy and very good, as they are accustomed to it, unlike our consisted largely of raw meat), it was better suited to their complexion than was European food. \"As our food is foreign and harmful to them, it does not give them strength to resist illness,\" he concluded. [84](javascript:;) Jos\u00e9 de Acosta summed up the current orthodoxy he observed in the fact that the Indians have been overworked, others to the changes of food and drink that they adopted after becoming accustomed to Spanish habits, and others to the excessive vice that they display in drink and other abuses.\" In This paradox reveals something of the contradiction at the heart of Spain's colonial enterprise. On the one hand, generations of colonial yearned for the hygiene, language, and religion. The centrality of evangelization to the colonial endeavor had of course been laid forth from the earliest days of the conquest, but Spanish ambitions extended far wider. [86](javascript:;) In his 1567 Gobierno del Per\u00fa, the Spanish jurist Juan de Matienzo provided a catalogue of separately desire expressed regularly by colonial A century after Matienzo composed his treatise, Juan de Sol\u00f3rzano Pereira was arguing that Indians should be taught Spanish \"so customs.\" Spanish clothing not only is not bad, but indeed is good for many reasons. Firstly, because they will grow to our clothes; secondly, because they will thereby begin to be more like men ... ; thirdly, being dressed as Spaniards they will be ashamed to sit together in the plaza to eat and drink and get drunk; and fourthly, because the more they spend, the more silver they will extract from the earth, and that much more Spanish merchandise will be sold, which will all be to the benefit of the treasury. [88] [89](javascript:;) Here, then, is caused to colonizers by too close an imitation of their ways by wily colonized people. Such discomfort was made all some of its typical foods. Hybridity perhaps characterized colonial space, in Spanish America as elsewhere, but this was frequently a source of For example, sumptuary laws, retained in colonial Spanish America for centuries after they were abandoned in Europe, struggled to maintain clear hierarchies that were regularly prohibited from dwelling in indigenous villages, so as to limit contact between the two groups. [92](javascript:;) Indeed, challenges to the colonial system example, following a riot Mexico City in 1692, when the city's indigenous population had risen outrages,\" noted one indignant priest. his from teaching the Indians to \"love us more,\" learning Spanish simply them Wearing clothing, which Matienzo had ... not infuses them with pride, and with their blankets they are more humble and obedient.\" [93](javascript:;) \"With their blankets they are more humble and obedient\": this observation, as distance. Maintaining the colonizers and colonized was as much a requirement of the enterprise as was the elimination of that separation by teaching the Indians To survive, Europeans needed to be able to eat the foods of the New World, or at least to succeed in cultivating their own crops in the colonial environment, but they did not wish to turn into Indians. Indians needed to learn to eat Ambivalence about whether Europeans could or could not eat maize, and whether maize was or was not like wheat, reflects deeper European doubts about whether they the Indies, and whether Amerindians could become part of the Hispanic world. Colonists in other parts of the world harbored similar doubts the consequences of culinary hybridity, for similar reasons. [94](javascript:;) Food is both a daily necessity and a potent symbol, and it is therefore particularly effective at capturing anxieties about status in virtually any social context. But in the early modern world, food was uniquely adapted to this role because of its importance in shaping the human body itself. Food, more than any other factor, was responsible for indigenous and Spanish bodies, and food could turn one into the other. Spanish concerns about whether Old World crops could be cultivated in the Indies thus reflected far more than mere nostalgia for Iberia, and colonial stipulations that Amerindians should (or should not) eat European foods directly about the physical integrity of their bodies, and about the maintenance or dissolution of the most fundamental of colonial divisions: that between the bodies of the colonizers and the Food thus provides a surprisingly effective vehicle for of colonial ideology, which aimed simultaneously to homogenize and to differentiate. This is because diet lay at the heart of early modern European ideas about identity, the body, and civilization us understand settlers Americas did not need to invent an embodied racism avant la lettre to account for the differences and Amerindians, or to explain why sickened. existing humoral models for understanding the phenomena. Despite of recent scholarship, the idea of racial fixity did not emerge in early America as a result of European encounters with new peoples and places. Colonists' understanding of the human body did allow for fixed, permanent, physical differences. Instead, Spaniards viewed both Indian and European bodies as mutable and porous, open to the influences many external forces, including, critically, food, which therefore occupied a central place in the maintenance of colonial society. It is for this reason that chroniclers and officials devoted so much attention to documenting the cultivation of Old World crops in the Americas, and the sons of conquistadors proudly recited the names of the European plants for bulwark that separated colonizers from colonized. [95](javascript:;) Food was the cultural icing on the colonial cake. Indeed, early modern actors did not view culture and bodies as fundamentally different. The physical body was generated in part through the ambient culture, and in particular through diet. Bodies were built out of food, and they differed one from another because of diet and other cultural practices, which were therefore understood to have a physical impact on the corporeality of the body. These were the ideas that Europeans brought with them to the New World, and which exercised a profound effect on their conceptualizations of the differences between themselves and the new peoples they encountered there. Colonial societies have perhaps always been structured around concepts of physical difference, but the ways in which those differences have been understood are both diverse and historically specific. As Joyce Chaplin has argued, we must pay close attention to European ideas about bodies and nature if we hope to understand the broader process of European colonization in the early modern era. [96](javascript:;) To do that, we need to pay attention to how Europeans thought about food.

The only example I have found in which the different humoral makeup of Indians and Spaniards is not ascribed at least in part to the consumption of different foodstuffs is Cobo. He noted that although Spaniards and Indians lived together in the same environment and used \"the same water and almost the same foods,\" there were great differences between them. He nonetheless concluded that it was impossible to determine whether Amerindians' and appearance was the result of \"their natural complexion, or their food and drink\"; Historia del Nuevo Mundo, 2: 13, 16 (book 11, chaps. 3-4). Juan de C\u00e1rdenas appears similarly to discount the importance of food in shaping complexion in one passage of his Problemas y secretos maravillosos de las Indias, where he asserts that Amerindians and Europeans \"use the same waters and even the same foods.\" fact, as this claim dramatically contradicts his repeated was the key features shaping complexion, it is clear that in this instance C\u00e1rdenas was aiming to focus attention on the argument ibid., 3, 4). For the centrality of diet, together with exercise the frequency of acts, in shaping complexion elsewhere in C\u00e1rdenas, see ibid., 179, 184, 210, 219 (book 3, chaps. 1, 2, 3, 9, 11). Some writers stated that it was impossible for mortals to understand why color varied so much among people, concluding that it was a mysterious act of God.

Her research concerns the cultural and intellectual history of colonial and independent Spanish America. Her most recent book, The Return of the Native: Indians and Mythmaking in Spanish America, 1810-1930 (Duke University 2007), explores nineteenth-century elite nationalism's engagement with the pre-conquest past. She is currently completing a book on food and the construction of the colonial body in the early modern Hispanic world.
