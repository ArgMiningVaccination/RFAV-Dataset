Testimonios orales Norteafricanos atribuyen efectos hipoglucemiantes a preparados medicinales del lagarto Uromastyx acanthinura (UA), para los que no existen evidencias cient\u00edficas actualmente. El objetivo de este trabajo fue el de investigar los efectos agudos de UA administrado oralmente en ratones diab\u00e9ticos C57Bl/6J inducidos por dieta grasa, y si se demostrase su efectividad evaluar el efecto de su administraci\u00f3n subcr\u00f3nica en el mismo modelo animal.M\u00e9todos Fue administrada una dieta a los animales con un contenido graso del 60% durante al menos 12 semanas. Para evaluar los efectos agudos diferentes dosis de UA o suero salino fueron administrados conjuntamente con 2g/kg de glucosa durante sobrecargas orales de glucosa (SOG), en diferentes d\u00edas, siguiendo un dise\u00f1o cruzado aleatorizado. La dosis m\u00e1s efectiva en esta fase fue entonces administrada mezclada en la dieta durante 90 d\u00edas y comparada con dieta solo en un dise\u00f1o paralelo. El peso corporal y el consumo de alimento fueron evaluados semanalmente. HbA1c, SOG, y test de tolerancia intraperitoneal a la insulina (TTIPI) fueron realizados al inicio y tras el tratamiento. La gravedad de la neuropat\u00eda fue determinada mediante la evaluaci\u00f3n de la alodinia al fr\u00edo.Resultados El UA redujo significativamente las concentraciones de glucosa de manera aguda en comparaci\u00f3n con el control a los 15min tras su administraci\u00f3n. Tras 90 d\u00edas de tratamiento no se observaron diferencias en las SOG o HbA1c entre grupos, mientras que para los test de tolerancia intraperitoneal a la isulina valores m\u00e1s altos de glucosa fueron determinados en los animales tratados con UA. Aunque ambos grupos aumentaron su peso, este tendi\u00f3 a ser mayor en los tratados, que a su vez consumieron significativamente m\u00e1s comida por d\u00eda. La respuesta a la alodinia al fr\u00edo mejor\u00f3 en frecuencia e intensidad en los tratados con UA.Conclusiones El UA administrado oralmente redujo de manera aguda la glucosa en sangre en ratones con diabetes. Parad\u00f3jicamente, su administraci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica aument\u00f3 el consumo de alimento, el peso y la resistencia a la insulina. La mejora en la respuesta nociceptiva sugiere un efecto en el dolor y/o la neuropat\u00eda. Aunque son necesarios m\u00e1s estudios para aclarar las propiedades y posibles aplicaciones de este producto, nuestros resultados subrayan el valor de los enfoques etnom\u00e9dicos hacia la medicina tradicional africana como origen para la evaluaci\u00f3n de nuevos compuestos bioactivos. Metformin and exenatide, for drug discovery [3](#bib0120) and, once a bioactive product is identified, confirmation uses previously reported are otitis and earache, skin infections and burns. [6,7](#bib0135) The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an UA extract on glucose metabolism in an animal model of type 2 diabetes. An UA preparation, elaborated in Mauritania, was donated to our research group by a patient. Following an ethnomedical approach, an diabetes. In vitro testing was initially but the lack of detailed pharmacological information, the heterogeneous nature of the product and the complexity of diabetes itself, made cell-assays a poor solution. The interview was frequency and route of administration. The whole carcass of UA (head excluded) is grilled and dried, and then minced (0.3-3cm) and incorporated into the diet. People traditionally take a handful of UA once or twice/day with food or water. The oral route was also used in the mice and doses were to body weight. A based different a range (0.13-1.56g/kg) was tested in the mice. The different doses of UA diluted in saline or saline alone (saline solution 0.9%, Braun Medical SA, Barcelona), were administered to each animal per body weight, males, 16 weeks weeks (D12492, Brogaarden, Lynge, were increased until the desired effect concentration or volume, was selected as an endpoint. The same doses were evaluated simultaneously in the whole group. In the long-term evaluation, the dose which had been most effective in the short-term experiments, was administered daily for 90 days in the high-fat diet (UA group) and compared to high-fat diet alone (control group) (n=10 per group: 50% males, 24 weeks of age, 20 weeks with 60%-fat diet). Body weight (BW), food and water consumption and state were assessed weekly. Morning blood glucose months' treatment. was least 30% (=0.05) with a statistical power of 80%, nine animals per group were deemed necessary. [13](#bib0170) The crossover design applied to reduce this number. In the sub-chronic phase, ten animals per group were used, allowing for a 10% loss and Uromastyx (solid line, UA; broken line, control). Crossover design of the experiment (a): on day 1, half of the group served as control while on day 2, after a 48h rest, the same group received the treatment. The other half of the group received treatment on day 1 and served as control on day 2. Thus, each treated animal tolerance test (*=p<0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of glucose was calculated by the trapezoid rule. comparisons was considered significant (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Animals were housed in groups of four-five per cage and provided with environmental enrichment. the Animal Welfare Ethics Committee (Comit\u00e9 \u00c9tico de Animal of glucose tended to be concentrations were significantly lower in the active treatment group only transiently: at weeks three (UA 132 [85-165], Control 167 [118-233]mg/dL; p=0.004) and five (UA 129 [119-139], Control 150 [111-201]mg/dL; p=0.012) after treatment start. Although both increased their BW, the increment tended associated with a certain level of distress (unplanned increment in light brightness). The two mice (2 females in the UA group, which were sacrificed due to their worsened condition) recovered their normal health status and stress level. Results for the comparisons between the treatment (solid lines and columns) and control groups, after 3 months of UA might be explained by the in its carcass, of a bioactive compound, either synthesised by UA itself, as is the case of Heloderma suspectum (exendin), [2](#bib0115) or included in its some of the and and the lack of persistence of lower glucose values after the first 5 weeks of treatment. However, other causes can be suggested, significantly in controls. Therefore, the improved response to cold allodynia could be due to direct effects on pain or neuropathy itself, and not as side-effect from a The effects detected allowed a reduction in the number of animals, which is one of the mandatory demands of the principles for laboratory animal handling. [17-20](#bib0190) Randomisation of treatment order the treatment sequence (saline-product vs. confirmed that the time left for clearance between treatments was long enough. The crossover design, [10](#bib0155) could be an answer to the claim to reduce animal numbers in the pre-evaluation of glucose-lowering and other bioactive compounds. Only data obtained from animals that were healthy at the end of the study were considered. However, a confounding effect of the development of dermatitis and the distress level cannot be ruled out. [21](#bib0210) This dermatitis was not attributed to UA, since both groups were affected by what is a common disorder in C57Bl/6J. [21](#bib0210) Although a a dermatitis.
