The increase in the clinical use of fosfomycin has led to the development of glpT and uhpT genes), amino acid mutations in the active site of the MurA target, and the production of fosfomycin-inactivating enzymes (fos genes). Different fosfomycin-modifying enzymes have been described. FosA (glutathione S-transferase), the plasmids homologous chromoso- mal genes to the clinical use of fosfomycin, although it is an old antibiotic, the experience in children is scarce. Recently, a review of fosfomycin use in pedi- atrics recommends it for UTI treatment, caused by years, FT was introduced as an option for the treatment of lower UTI in children older than 6 years of age and adults12. that fosfomycin use to FT is not routinely tested in all laboratories and there is sparse data available about susceptibility proles in E. coli isolates from UTI in children. Hereby we propose to describe antibiotic susceptibility tract infections in resistant strains. - -14 years old with UTI, assisted at a hospital in Uruguay during 5/15/2018- - -8/15/2019, were included.

Incompatibility groups and toxin- - -antitoxin resistant bacteria were collected by revision of medical records. Variables collected were age, sex, symptoms and signs, urine exam results, whether it was the rst episode of UTI or recurrence, presence of morphological or functional abnormalities of the urinary and antibiotic consump- tion in the last 6 months. The study was approved by the ethics committee and board of directors. From May 2018 to August 2019, 286 urine cultures with signicant growth (1 \u00d7 105CFU/ml) in 255 urine cultures in 7 (2.5%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus and others in 5 (1.7%).

Ec870 was obtained from the urine of a 6-year old girl with dysuria and abdominal pain. This was her fth UTI episode in the last 2 years, all caused by E. coli isolates with the same resistance prole (only resistant to ampi- cillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).

MIC to UTI caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is increasing worldwide, leading to the need for alternative antibiotic plans. Even though fosfomycin is an old antibiotic, FT was introduced in the last years for the treatment of lower UTI in children older than 6 years old. Fosfomycin susceptibility is not always in clinical microbiology laboratories, and scarce data are available in children. In this study, E. coli was the predominant etiological agent (89.2%) of UTI in children years, followed 122Revista Argentina type 69 Phylogenetic group D ESBL synergy test (+) (+) MIC Ceftriaxone 4 4 1 Meropenem 0.5 0.5 0.5 Imipenem 0.25 0.25 0.25 Amikacin 8 8 8 (mg/l) 256 256 0.125 Fosfomycin disk genes, and dis- tribution of the etiological agents in the same age group in Spain is similar to that reported here14. With regard ve S. saprophyticus with natural resistance and one E. coli with acquired resistance to fosfomycin). In Spain, susceptibility to fosfomycin from UTI isolates in children aged 5- - -15 years was 88%, most of the resistant isolates corresponded to K. pneumoniae and only 2% of E. coli isolates were resistant to fosfomycin14. In this work, we conjugative from our country5. However , this is not only the rst report of fosA3 but also the association of bla CTX-M-14 /fosA3 in an E. coli isolate in Uruguay. Although E. coli ST69, harboring bla CTX-M-9 (another mem- ber of the bla along with bla CTX-M-14 ) has been previously detected in adults in Uruguay15, commonly, antibi- otic families7. As far as we know, this is the rst detectionof fosA3 /bla CTX-M-14 in a ST69 E. coli isolate of human origin worldwide. In this sense, the occurrence of these resistance deter- minants in a conjugative plasmid brings the possibility to transfer to other sequence with resistance to more antibiotic families such as ST1317. On the other hand, this nding is worrisome due to the possible dissemination of these resistance mechanisms to susceptible strains. Considering this, the UTI treatment or third-generation cephalosporins or fosfomycin tromethamine both antibiotic families, as the case with this patient who had received cefuroxime for the treatment of previous UTI episodes. Most of the strains studied in this work showed high susceptibility to except ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in which resistance exceeded 20%. a endorsing for oral UTI empirical treatment.

The high oral antimicrobial agents in our setting broadens empirical treatment options. For UTI, amoxicillin-clavulanate be suitable options. Fosfomycin enterobacteria producers, its use is not recommended when there are other treatment options of a narrower spectrum. As its use increases, active monitoring of will be necessary.
