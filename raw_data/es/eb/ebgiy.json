The focus had initially been on decreasing the of fatalities and workers persons whose state of health meant they were particularly at risk. On 19 January European Commission [adopted](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_143) a [Communication](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021DC0035&qid=1616149581345) calling to speed up the rollout of vaccines across the EU. By mid-July of that year, [Europe had enough vaccine doses to vaccinate 70% of the EU adult population](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_3921). [Reports and data on the vaccination progress in Europe ]are available on the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Speeding up vaccine production The Commission has invested large amounts of funding into the development of the production capacity of vaccine developers in the EU, and continues to monitor the epidemiological situation in order to adopt appropriate measures if necessary. Ramping up industrial vaccine production in the EU On 4 February 2021, the European Commission set up a [Task Force](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/coronavirus-response/task-force-industrial-scale-covid-19-vaccines_en) under the authority of the Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, in cooperation with the Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides. The Task Force aims to ramp up production capacity for vaccines in the EU, acting as a one-stop-shop for manufacturers in need of support, and to identify and address bottlenecks in production capacity and supply chains. The regular contacts of the Task Force with industry and Member States allow the Commission to have a good understanding of vaccine production capacities in the EU. The Task Force is also regularly updating a mapping of vaccine production capacities in the EU, including the related EU supply chain. The Task Force organised [matchmaking events](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_1504) with companies in March (focus therapeutic medicines) information shared by Member States, these events allowed companies to do the first mapping of the vaccines production capacity in EU. The mapping included information on production capacity of the companies that had agreed to make this information public. This data has then been updated, as further information became available. The Task Force contributed to the rapid increase in Europe's industrial capacity to produce vaccines. The monthly production capacity in the EU was significantly ramped up, from 20 million vaccine doses at the beginning of 2021 to a capacity and actual production of around 300 million vaccine doses per month in the second half of 2021. By mid-July 2021, the EU had produced over 1 billion doses of vaccines, and in a year, around 3 billion doses. The Task Force also contributed to the [Team Europe initiative on manufacturing and access to medicines, vaccines and health technologies (MAV+) in Africa](https://capacity4dev.europa.eu/resources/team-europe-tracker), and coordinated with international partners, notably the US, in the context of the [EU-U.S. COVID-19 Manufacturing and Supply Chain Taskforce](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_4847). EU FAB network for vaccines manufacturing The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for Europe to be better prepared for future health priorities. On 30 June 2023 the [European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA)](https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/index_en), acting on behalf of the Health Emergency Preparedness and (HERA), [signed a framework contract](https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/news/framework-contract-signed-under-eu4health-guarantee-fast-response-future-health-crises-2023-06-30_en) with four contractors setting up the EU FAB network for sufficient and agile manufacturing capacities for different vaccine types and protein-based). These can be activated quickly, securing a total of 325 million doses per year in case of a public health emergency. The EU FAB network comprises [vaccine producers in the EU](https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-06/230531_EUfab-call_v01_0.pdf) (Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain). The actions of the network will close the gap between manufacturing and scaling up of vaccine production, while ensuring the capacity of the industry to produce vaccine exports to by Member States. This was to ensure timely access to vaccines for all EU citizens and transparency of vaccine exports outside the EU. measure place until December data. As a result, vaccine producers no longer have to request an authorisation for the export of vaccines outside the EU. Global cooperation During the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission and the EU as a whole provided assistance to non-EU countries in improving enhancing local vaccines production capacity. more about management vaccines following [expression of interest](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1540) on 31 August and its announcement of a contribution of \u20ac400 million. COVAX is part of the [Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator](https://www.act-a.org/), a global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. ACT brings together governments, philantropists and global health organisations such as the Bill & Gates Foundation, Coalition Preparedness Global Fund, the World Bank and Global Financing Facility. All together the Commission, Member States and the European Investment Bank became a leading investor in COVAX, contributing over \u20ac5 billion to make available 92 low and middle-income countries. In January 2021, the Commission It allowed COVAX in a Team Europe approach, paying special attention to the Western Balkans, the Eastern and Southern neighbourhood, and Africa. By August 2023, EU Member States had shared more than 530 million doses for donation to countries around the world. The large majority, around 445 million doses were shared by COVAX. In addition, EU Member States have delivered 87 million doses through bilateral donations - for instance to our neighbours in the Western Balkans. On 21 May 2021, at the G20 Global Health Summit in Rome, President Ursula von der Leyen announced a Team Europe initiative on manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. The initiative will help create an enabling environment for local manufacturing in Africa and tackle barriers on both supply and demand sides. It will be backed by \u20ac1 billion from EU budget and the European development finance institutions such as the European Investment Bank (EIB). This amount will be further enhanced by contributions from EU Member States. The EU, in partnership with Spain, has also launched a [partnership with Latin America and the Caribbean](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_3890) to support local manufacturing of vaccines, medicines and other health technologies, and to strengthen the resilience of health systems. etina(161.74 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_cs) - dansk(160.48 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_da) - Deutsch(163.6 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_de) - eesti(158.21 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_et) - (190.35 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_el) - English(158.28 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_en) - fran\u00e7ais(165.37 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_fr) - hrvatski(158.73 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_hr) - italiano(161.87 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_it) - latvieu(160.77 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_lv) - lietuvi(158.72 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_lt) - magyar(165.52 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_hu) - Malti(163.46 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_mt) - Nederlands(162.25 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_nl) - polski(163.9 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_pl) - portugu\u00eas(163.76 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_pt) - rom\u00e2n(165.42 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_ro) - slovenina(160.49 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_sk) - slovenina(157.61 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_sl) - suomi(160.02 KB - HTML) [Descargar](/document/download/8e37e44c-6d72-45ba-927d-3529565665f2_fi) - svenska(160.15 KB "}
