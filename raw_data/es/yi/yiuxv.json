It is worth that vaccine to confer some protection gonococcal for adolescents. The vaccination abroad also needs to be contemplated, as is the case in any other age group. Vaccination against hepatitis A, which is included in the routine immunization schedule of Catalonia, Ceuta and Melilla from the second year of life, should also be considered a priority in adolescents traveling to endemic areas. El documento de consenso Calendario de vacunaciones del adolescente que se presenta tiene la autor\u00eda de tres sociedades cient\u00edficas: la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Pediatr\u00eda (AEP) con su Comit\u00e9 Asesor de Vacunas (CAV), la Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Medicina de la Adolescencia (SEMA) y la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Vacunolog\u00eda (AEV). Las infecciones tienen sus peculiaridades en la adolescencia, como la mayor susceptibilidad a la tosferina, la peor evoluci\u00f3n de la varicela, la parotiditis y la hepatitis A, la incidencia frecuente de infecciones de transmisi\u00f3n sexual, o el aumento de la tasa de portadores de meningococo. Se analiza el calendario correspondiente a esta franja de edad sin perder la visi\u00f3n global de las inmunizaciones. Se contemplan las vacunaciones del calendario del adolescente sano: frente a la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica invasora (tetravalente MenACWY y MenB), frente al virus del papiloma humano (que debe hacerse con independencia de g\u00e9nero), frente a la tosferina, frente a la gripe y frente a la covid (en no vacunados y en grupos de riesgo). Se destaca que la vacuna 4CMenB tiene una cierta efectividad frente a la infecci\u00f3n por gonococo, que ser\u00eda una gran ventaja a\u00f1adida para el adolescente. Los calendarios del adolescente perteneciente a grupos de riesgo y del viajero deben ser considerados, al igual que en todas las edades de la vida. La vacuna de la hepatitis A que est\u00e1 incluida en el calendario de vacunaciones sistem\u00e1ticas de Catalu\u00f1a, Ceuta y Melilla, desde el segundo a\u00f1o de vida, debe considerarse con prioridad en el calendario del adolescente viajero. The consensus document we present here, the Vaccination schedule for adolescents, has been developed by three scientific societies in related fields: two in the field of adolescent care, the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Pediatr\u00eda (Spanish Association of Pediatrics, AEP), including its Advisory Committee on Vaccines (CAV), and the Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Medicina de la Adolescencia (Spanish Society of Adolescent Medicine, SEMA), and one devoted to vaccination in all age groups from an integral and cross-cutting perspective, the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Vacunolog\u00eda (Spanish Association of Vaccinology, AEV). [1](#bib0005) This document analyses the immunization schedule specific age group, adolescents, ever losing sight of the global perspective on vaccination that been presented since 2019 in the recommended nationwide \"Shared Immunization Schedule for the Lifespan\" of the Interterritorial Council of the National Health System of Spain. The adolescent immunization schedule has been enhanced in recent years with the authorization of new vaccines: pertussis SARS-CoV-2. There is also the vaccine against hepatitis A, which must be given to travellers to endemic areas, whose routine administration is now included in the schedules of Catalonia, Ceuta and Melilla from age 2 years. Some of these vaccines are included in the publicly funded immunization schedule and others, for now, are prescribed on a case-by-case basis or administered after shared decision-making the (the current schedule only includes them at age 12 years) are examples of these situations. As is the case with any other age group, the vaccination of adolescents in risk groups or who travel to endemic areas must also be contemplated.The adolescent The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to define adolescence as \"the phase of life between childhood and adulthood, from ages 10 to 19\". It is a stage characterised by important and sexual maturation) and psychosocial changes affected by brain development, which is not completed until the third decade of life. [2](#bib0010) The health of adolescents is influenced by their family, cultural and social environment and by their individual characteristics (onset of puberty, importance. On the too many adolescents experience lifelong deleterious mission of paediatrics is to provide adequate care to this age group with the goal of improving morbidity and mortality. In regard to vaccination, every visit provides an opportunity to encourage and update vaccination in to increase diseases in adolescents. Adolescents are the risk of IMD following children aged less than 5 years. Serogroup B is the most prevalent in Europe and causes more cases in adolescents and young adults (55% of total cases) than groups A, C, W and Y combined. [6](#bib0030) In Spain, there was a decreasing trend in the incidence of IMD between the 199697 and the 2013-2014 seasons. From the 2014-2015 season, the trend has been increasing on account of the increasing incidence of cases caused by groups W and Y, while the incidence of cases caused by group B barely changed. [7](#bib0035) Overall, with the advent of the coronavirus disease (COVID) 2019 pandemic and the ensuing respiratory transmission control measures, there was a substantial decrease in the incidence of IMD. Since 2021, we are witnessing an increase in cases, especially by group B. In regions of the United Kingdom (UK) and France, there have been outbreaks caused by group B in adolescents, of specific and many European countries, including vaccine is funded for immunization of adolescents in the Czech Republic, some regions of Italy and the state of South Australia, and recommended, but not publicly funded, in Austria, Hungary and all other Australian states. The safety of meningococcal vaccines in adolescents and young adults is excellent, and no safety concerns have emerged with its use in routine vaccination programmes nasopharyngeal the evidence on the effectiveness of the MenACWY vaccine for this purpose is insufficient. Still, experiences like the one in the Netherlands (campaign for massive vaccination of adolescents with MenACWY) vaccine can achieve herd The vaccinated [11](#bib0055) in adolescence for individuals vaccinated with the Men B vaccine in infancy or As an individual preventing gonorrhoea, which affects more than million individuals at the global level and whose incidence has been increasing in recent worldwide. More than 200 genotypes have been characterised, of which 12 are oncogenic, with types 16 and 18 causing approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases. The caused by HPV rectum, oropharyngeal region, female or male reproductive systems and even the respiratory system. Types 6 and 11 are also believed to cause most cases of prevalence of time and with the number of sexual partners, affecting both sexes. The prevalence is higher in men than women, with of 85% individuals aged 18-70 years, remaining through the lifespan. The is that HPV persists longer in mucosal tissue. [15](#bib0075) The virus by asymptomatic infections eliminated by the giving developing cancer. From the time routine vaccination against HPV for girls was introduced, there has been a progressive decrease in the burden of disease in women in many parts of the world, while in men it has remained stable and, for some diseases, even continued Two vaccines against currently available in Spain. One is a bivalent vaccine against types 16 and 18, and another is a 9-valent vaccine that includes 5 oncogenic types and offers protection against genital warts. important to vaccinate individuals of both sexes before the sexual debut, as they can prevent initial infection but not the potential health a previously acquired infection. [17](#bib0085) Primary vaccination can start from age 9 years, with 2 doses if starting before age 15 years and 3 doses otherwise, except in immunosuppressed individuals, who should receive 3 doses regardless of the the start of vaccination. [18](#bib0090) Pertussis is traditionally are at postvaccination infection and, can play an important role in its transmission. [19](#bib0095) In Spain, just 70% of cases of pertussis occurred in children under 14 years in the 2005-2020 period, and in 2020 the incidence in individuals aged 15-49 years increased by 50. [20](#bib0100) The vaccines against levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States recommend vaccination of adolescents (aged 12-14 years) with the Tdap vaccine. [19](#bib0095) Other countries, like the UK, proposed for 2023 recommends vaccination with the Td vaccine at age 14 years. [22](#bib0110) The 2023 immunization schedule of the AEP recommends vaccination at age 12-14 years with the Tdap vaccine, and this is also the case in the regional immunization schedule of Asturias. [13](#bib0065) The evidence on the effectiveness of vaccination in adolescents is heterogeneous. In the United the incidence of pertussis in has increased despite that following However, study conducted in the United States demonstrated that vaccination of adolescents with the Tdap vaccine can be effective in reducing frequency of hospitalization due to pertussis administering the Tdap rather than the Td vaccine at 14 the opportunity to protect adolescents against pertussis, despite of the limited impact strategy in the general population. More effective vaccines need to be introduced to children and adolescents triples the incidence in adults and the elderly. In Spain, in the incidence was in children aged less than 15 years, with 744.7 new cases per 100 000 in the 5-to-14 years age group. The burden of disease caused by influenza in the child and adolescent population tends to be underestimated [25](#bib0125) by both health care professionals and the general population, chiefly due to a lack of awareness of its clinical significance at the individual level and in terms of the use of health care resources. In adolescents, compared to adults, infection by influenza tends to cause more severe fever and associated symptoms in addition to a of be considered a benign in adolescence, for, while it is interactions are more frustrating for adolescents. Closer physical contact (sports, friend groups) makes the transmission of influenza more likely. habits, substance use\u2014in short, specific lifestyle the short and medium term, the indications for vaccination in healthy habits. recent review of the evidence of vaccination against seasonal influenza found an efficacy of 25.6%-74.2% and an effectiveness of 26%-78.8%, healthy available inactivated vaccines and intranasal attenuated vaccine, all of them quadrivalent, can be found at the online immunization manual of the AEP. [28](#bib0140) The perception that influenza is a mild disease in adolescents must change. We must raise health care professionals public vaccination strategies this age group, independently of any potential risk factors.Vaccination against COVID According to the national epidemiological surveillance network of Spain, [29](#bib0145) from the start of pandemic to April 21, 6374 and 34 died due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the last year, there were 1374 related hospital admissions, 69 ICU admissions and 7 deaths. As of March 31, 2023, a total of 105 733 320 doses of COVID vaccine had been administered in Spain. Of the 42 350 585 inhabitants aged more than 12 years, 92.6% are fully vaccinated, percentage of 95.8% in the 12-to-19 years subset. [30](#bib0150) In May 2023, the omicron variant continues to be the most prevalent in Spain. It is characterised by greater recombinant (Bimervax\u00ae) for individuals aged [32](#bib0160) Most doses administered in Spain were of Comirnaty\u00ae vaccine. Monovalent vaccines continue belonging risk groups, regardless of the number of doses received in the past, a booster recommended in campaign progressed, aged than 5 years could be vaccinated upon request. [33](#bib0165) The COVID vaccines are very safe. The most frequent events are local, such as swelling develop within 24-48 hours of vaccination and usually last one or two days. They develop more frequently after the second dose than after the first. [34](#bib0170) With universal vaccination, there were reports of cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines (although the risk is greater with the actual infection), a rare adverse event that generally develops within 14 days of vaccination after the second dose in male recipients 12-29 In most cases, the course was benign, with resolution in 2-3 days. We do not recommend the use of the mRNA vaccine in any individual who experienced an episode of myocarditis or pericarditis following a previous dose. [33,34](#bib0165) Individuals at risk are those with medical conditions, behaviours or histories of exposure that the protection against [35](#bib0175) historically adolescents have not been a focus of attention when it comes to the risk groups to consider for vaccination, this population has characteristics recommendations. For instance, without supervision, they may become sexually active, with corresponding of diseases like diabetes. [38](#bib0190) Some of the groups in adolescent adolescents all who require specific management. Another issue that may arise in this age group is a reduction in vaccination coverage, something that is also common in risk groups. Consequently, vaccination at this age is key for the health of our youth, especially those who exhibit risk behaviours. Vaccination of household members adolescents is an essential protective strategy that has not usually evaluated in the scientific literature.Vaccination of travelling adolescents Any adolescents plan to travel, well as their parents, should be aware and mature enough to schedule a visit with their medical provider at least one month before departure. [39](#bib0195) We must convey the carry a risk of contracting infections through consumption of water or foods, mosquito bites and risk behaviours. Depending on the vaccination schedule of the adolescent, the travel destination, duration of the trip, time of the year and type of activity that will take place, pharmacological prophylaxis, primary vaccination or a indicated. The recommendations for vaccination of Spanish adolescents that are going to travel can be found in the online manual of the AEP. [40](#bib0200) Some vaccines are required to enter certain as the yellow fever vaccine (an endemic disease in large part of Africa and South America, which requires 1 dose of vaccine 10 days before departure and a booster for adolescents who received primary vaccination before age 2 years), the MenACWY vaccine (African meningitis belt, students, attendees to concerts or festivals with massive audiences; with repeat vaccination every 5 years for risk groups) and the poliovirus vaccine (stays longer than 4 weeks in countries with circulation of wild or vaccine-derived strains, with administration 1 dose 1 months more from vaccination); other European encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, typhoid fever, hepatitis A (included in the immunization schedules of Catalonia, Ceuta and Melilla and indicated as a priority for travellers) or rabies, in addition to ensuring vaccination status is immunization schedule. destination, of insect repellents and adequate clothing.Funding The development of these recommendations (analysis of the published data, debate, consensus and publication) has not been supported by any funding source outside of the logistic Alter, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, Pfizer and Sanofi-Pasteur and as a consultant in GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, Pfizer GlaxoSmithKline, Ordesa, Sanofi-Pasteur and as a consultant MSD Spain and abroad.
