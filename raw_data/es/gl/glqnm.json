We work to save lives, alleviate suffering and restore dignity. Our actions and the principles of neutrality and impartiality. In order to be able to access and assist people in need, our operational policies must be scrupulously independent of governments, as well as religious and economic powers. We conduct our own assessments, manage our projects directly and monitor the impact of our assistance. We do not accept funds from governments or other parties who are directly involved the conflicts to which MSF is responding.

The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines supports existing medicines, diagnostics appropriate medicines. MSF also funds in Paris, France in 1971, MSF today is a worldwide movement of associations, with offices all over the world. Specialised organisations - satellites studies, and research on humanitarian and social action. In 2011 MSF's international governance structure was reformed. MSF International was registered Switzerland, and in December 2011 the first annual MSF International General Assembly (IGA) was held. In subsequent years, the IGA will be held in June. The IGA comprises two representatives of each MSF association, two representatives elected by the individual members of MSF International, and the International President. The IGA is the highest authority of MSF International and is responsible for safeguarding MSF's medical and providing MSF entities. The International Board acts on behalf of and is accountable to the IGA. It is made up of representatives of MSF's operational directorates as well as a group elected by the IGA, and is chaired by the International President. The International Board prepares and presents the international combined Financial Statements to the OGA for approval.For the year ended 31 December 2015 THE CHARTER OF M\u00c9DECINS SANS FRONTI\u00c8RES M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res is a private international association.

Over one million people in northeastern remain high-quality surgical care as a Our thoughts go out to the friends and families of those who died. We also remember our colleagues who tragically lost their lives this year in a helicopter crash in Nepal and our colleague who was killed in the Central African Republic (CAR). We take this opportunity as well to tell Philippe, Richard and Romy, our staff who are still missing in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), that they are not forgotten. Attacks on healthcare and the subsequent suffering of civilians The repercussions of on health continue long after the initial impact. The thousands of civilians being deprived of essential medical care at a time when they need it most. MSF was able to work in Kunduz thanks to negotiated with all parties to the conflict that they would respect the neutrality of the medical facility. An independent and impartial inquiry into the facts and circumstances of the attack is needed, as we cannot rely on military bombardments of hospitals are not new, but neither can they be dismissed as simple Kunduz coverage because an international organisation was targeted by the US military. At a time when attacks on healthcare are intensifying and civilians are paying the price, what is often an overlooked issue was pushed into the international spotlight. In January, an MSF hospital in South Kordofan, Sudan, was bombed by the Sudanese Air Force, injuring one patient and one staff member. This same hospital had also been bombed in June 2014. Medical facilities were also shelled in Ukraine at the beginning of the year, but it is in Syria where we really see medical care becoming the target of both deliberate and indiscriminate violence. Laws passed in 2012 including the harming the opposition; an alarming trend of impunity. In 2015, there were 94 aerial shelling attacks on 63 MSFsupported facilities, causing varying degrees of damage and, in 12 cases, resulting in the total destruction of the facility; 81 MSFsupported medical staff were killed or wounded. Towards the end of the year, medical facilities in Yemen were also bombed. an MSF-supported hospital, leaving over 200,000 people without access to medical care. As a result of these repeated attacks on medical facilities, some visits to hospitals as riskier than not seeking medical care at all. The 'security at all costs' logic means that humanitarian aid is welcomed when it serves national security interests but is restricted, even attacked, when it does not. People on Conflict and people to flee their homes and their countries this year. In early 2015, large numbers of refugees crossed into Tanzania to escape election-related violence in Burundi. By July, as many as 3,000 people were arriving in the country each week, and it was estimated that 78,000 Burundians were sheltering in Nyarugusu camp. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, it is estimated that more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees and Palestinian refugees from Syria have arrived in Lebanon and the small country is struggling to cope. In Jordan, over 600,000 Syrian refugees have been registered to date. In the Lake Chad region in western Africa, 2.5 million people in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria fled their homes following attacks by Boko Haram displaced person camps. Counter-offensives by armed forces have only added to their suffering. MSF works in in Lebanon, running to the four affected countries in the Lake Chad region. A large part of the global responsibility for hosting refugees to 2015, at least 3,771 people died while attempting the sea crossing to Europe. MSF conducted search and rescue operations at sea and provided at Europe's entry and of Europe's displaced. Due to a lack of safe alternatives, people resort to smugglers and risk their lives on dangerous and uncertain journeys to escape war and persecution or because they are in search of a better and safer life for themselves and their families. The humanitarian crisis that has unfolded on the borders of the European Union (EU) is largely policy-driven, a result of the EU's failure to put in place effective and humane policies and responses to deal with the unprecedented, but in many ways foreseeable, movement of people. The lack of political will, which became so obvious when dealing with Ebola, was again evident countries far despite that in some cases they themselves are contributing to the suffering. Four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are involved in bombing Syrian civilians - Russia, USA, France and Britain. There has been an unacceptable lack Dr Joanne Liu International PresidentJ\u00e9reme Oberreit Secretary General of recognition of the reasons why people are fleeing their countries, and most efforts to date have concentrated on deterrence measures aimed at stemming the flow of and migrants arriving on EU soil. It is estimated that one million people fled to Europe in 2015, and that almost 50 per cent of them came from Syria. With no end to the war in sight, the numbers will only continue to grow. The EU has externalised the management of its borders to Turkey, handing over billions of euros in return for a clampdown on Syrians attempting to make the crossing. The end result of border closures from Europe all the way back to Syria is that civilians are being trapped in one of the most brutal wars of our times. Ongoing and intensifying violence in South Sudan Civilians in South Sudan continue to be exposed to extreme levels of violence. In 2015, rape, abduction and execution were commonplace in some parts of the country, and regional and international attempts to the conflict and looted and destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people fled into the bush and swamplands, where they had no access to assistance for months at a time. MSF medical facilities were looted or attacked on three separate former members were struggled to worst-affected areas but was able to deliver lifesaving medical care at its projects on the frontlines and through mobile clinics. Compounding the severe humanitarian crisis, South Sudan also outbreak of malaria that MSF has ever witnessed in the country and its second outbreak of cholera in two years. Response and research and development (R&D) for epidemics Towards the end of 2015, the Ebola outbreak was declared over in Sierra Leone and Guinea, but new cases have since been reported. The public health systems in the affected countries in West Africa have been devastated and routine vaccine campaigns, including for measles, Reinstating non-Ebola-related healthcare and re-establishing people's ending the epidemic. However, this is further complicated by a lack of trained medical personnel. It is estimated that over 880 medical staff contracted Ebola in the three worst-affected countries, and over 500 died. There are also over survivors, many of are are common in places where people are forced to live in unsanitary conditions such as refugee children between September, and treated 20,000 patients for the disease. Campaign launched its 'Fair Shot' campaign in a bid to the prices of vaccines, in particular for pneumococcal disease. There has been a 68-fold increase in the price for the package of childhood vaccines over the last decade. Malaria also continues to be a major challenge around the world, despite elimination strategies, and there are outbreaks of such as yellow fever, chikungunya and Lassa fever. In 2015, there was a large outbreak of Zika virus (first identified in humans in 1952) in the Americas, which resulted in the World Health Organization declaring it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in early 2016. Very few diagnostic tests are currently available, and there is no specific vaccine or treatment. R&D must be undertaken with communities and environments in the contexts where they are needed most. Ebola exposed a global R&D infrastructure that is unfit for purpose; it cannot help save lives during an emergency. We should be conducting safety studies and working out ethical frameworks during inter-epidemic in order to be prepared. and efficiency trials epidemic peaks. Yet, all too often, we scramble to act only as an epidemic peters out. We must act ahead of epidemics, not at the tail end. Over the past few years MSF has had to adapt its response to meet the challenges of individual contexts, and in Syria in 2015 we continued to run health facilities in the country but also offered support, donated medicines and equipment, and doctors. of sexual violence and treatment for malnutrition. Out of the spotlight, tens of thousands of MSF staff treat patients with HIV and tuberculosis, malaria and malnutrition, offer specialist care to mothers and children, campaigns and surgery in nearly 70 countries around the world. We want to pay tribute to them, and to thank our supporters for making our work audited Financial Statements of the 21 main offices worldwide (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States), together with the Financial Statements of the offices in Argentina, the Czech Republic, Republic of Korea, India The Financial Statements provide a view of MSF's work internationally and are a means of transparency and accountability.
