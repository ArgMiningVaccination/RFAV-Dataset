With so much talk of heart disease, diabetes and the noxious effects of agrochemicals, it is little wonder that more people are looking for ways to eat a healthier diet. So when Ron and Kim Miller first started selling organic vegetables in Boquete around six months ago, they quickly found that everything was snapped up almost before they could get it out on the table. In fact, their produce proved so popular that many regular clients now email their orders ahead of time to be sure of getting just what they want. When you see the quality of the vegetables, herbs and baked goods on offer it is little surprise that Ron and Kim are in such high demand. Giant orange sweet potatoes, small spinach heirloom runner beans, rosemary, oregano, thyme, dill and much all ginger snaps, rum freshly-picked lemon, lime and Thai basil perfuming the air. It is all looks and smells irresistible - and is all the more so because the buyers know that it is all 100 per cent chemical free. \"We do no artificial chemicals for pest control or fertilizer,\" said Ron. \"All our fertilizing is done with organic abono (manure) which is produced locally. We also use a worm compost tea made by our own worms and from another farm close by.\" The couple's 17 hectare farm is near the small town of Santa Marta, just 10 km west of Concepci\u00f3n close to the border with Costa Rica. \"It was a cattle grazing farm so it was easy to make it organic because it had never had any spraying done on it,\" said Ron. The couple moved there in 2006 and spent the next two years getting everything started, putting in interior roads, infrastructure, farm buildings, their house and, most recently, a new deep well, to ensure that there is enough water in the dry season. Their greenhouses now cover 12,800 square feet, with another 20,000 square feet planned for next year. They have 100 free-range chickens ready to start producing eggs and dressed meat for the local market. Twenty five head of cattle have been kept on to keep the grass low and a steady supply of manure at the ready for plans tilapia ponds to provide organic fish for local consumption. Of the two, Kim is the gardener and she is also a trained herbalist. She had her own health food store in the US and still makes her own cosmetics and beauty and more. For the moment she imports much of what she sells from her manufacturer in Virginia but her aim is to start to use the herbs she grows on the Santa Marta farm. \"I love the vegetables but the herbs are where my heart is,\" she said. \"My intention is to grow as many American herbs as I can here. But I also plan to get familiar with the local herbs. The growing is what I love the most. I love to get my fingers in the ground. I love the smells.\" Many of the seeds used by the Millers are organic heirloom varieties brought home. Besides the organic fertilizers and avoidance of all things chemical, Kim also has her own special techniques to encourage her plants to grow. \"I talk to them. I sing to them. There are different chants - Indian Cherokee songs, that kind of thing.\" \"You have to honor the plant and you have to be respectful and then it is glad to help you. The essence is there and you get the medicine. Sometimes I pray when I\u00b4m harvesting that the herb will Ron is more pragmatic. \"I guess enjoy the challenge because we are still here doing it and most days we\u00b4re smiling,\" he said. \"At this time in history, at this time in our lives, growing healthy foods is a great place to be.\" Organic fruits and vegetables contain up to be held at the beginning of September will look at organic seed production and controlling using natural pesticides. at various organic producer\u00b4s farms so that participants can see, in situ, how the techniques work.
