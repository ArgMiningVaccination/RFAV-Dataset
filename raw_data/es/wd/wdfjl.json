Leukoencephalopathy is the structural damage of cerebral white matter due to the destruction of myelin. Multiple conditions leukoencephalopathy (TL) is caused by the due dose or time and entity. However, an over increasing frequency has psychoactive substances abuse. [2,4](#bib0095) Inhaled heroin use has been associated with the incidence of TL since the 1980s. [5](#bib0110) Brain damage hypoxic-ischemic pathology. [6,7](#bib0115) In the present report, we present a fatal case of TL in a young man with inhaled heroin consumption. A 28 years-old man from the urban area of Pereira (Colombia) was admitted to the emergency department presenting past two weeks. He had no medical or surgical record, except for substance abuse such as marijuana and cocaine since he was 15 years old. He reported inhaled heroin use over the last two years, with an increasing pattern in the last six months. He was sign was found. Hemodynamics parameters were stable, and no signs of respiratory difficulty were reported. Total blood count showed mild infectious diseases test such as HIV, syphilis, hepatitis nuclei, posterior consent to use the clinical and radiological records to present and publish the case for scientific and academic purposes, conserving the privacy and identity of of the record.Literature Review WM covers approximately half of the brain and it is composed of multiple intra and interhemispheric tracts. WM considered in patients with neurobehavioral were exposed synthesized the medicine. white smoke that a dragon tail. This smoke is \"pursued\" or inhaled through a straw or a tubular structure. This technique is also called \"Chinese blow\". This practice was recognized for the first time in Hong Kong in the 1950s, but nowadays it has been extended to users all the world. [9,10](#bib0130) Despite inhaled heroin consumption is frequent, and the is known, it has rarely been reported. [11](#bib0140) The first and largest outbreak of TL associated with the use of inhaled heroin was reported in 1982 in the Netherlands, including 47 cases, of which 11 died. [5](#bib0110) Since 1982, sporadic cases have been reported in Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States, and China, among others [5,10-12](#bib0110) Autopsies from TL patients sheaths, with demyelination of the brain, cerebral stem, cerebellum, cord; these findings are called seems to be responsible for cerebral damage [6,10](#bib0115) In a German study carried out in 2014, eight limb of the internal capsule. Heroin TL death. [10-12](#bib0135) Heroin TL mortality ranges between 23 and 25%, and death occurs mainly due to respiratory failure. There is no effective treatment for TL [10-12](#bib0135) United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that, worldwide, approximately 5% of the global adult population has used drugs at least once, 0.6% suffered from drug use disorders (SUD). About 28 million years of \"healthy life\" were lost worldwide in 2015 because of disability drugs and for 70% of the SUD global burden. [15](#bib0160) In Colombia, there were about 32 thousand people consuming heroin in 2013, with an expected increase to date. Medellin, Cali, Pereira, and Armenia are the more affected cities by the heroin-related disorders. [16,17](#bib0165) In patients to heroin consumption, just like this clinical case, will be psychiatric institutions. Inhaled with severe neurological compromise and high disability and death risk. Since heroin consumption is becoming more and there have methadone treatment barriers, [17](#bib0170) may presentado en la modalidad de short oral presentation en el 18thWPA World Congress of Psychiatry, en Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, entre el 27 y el 30 de septiembre de 2018.
