These enhanced services have been shown to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and reduce overall nutrition, personally all CPSP services. Personal supervision may occur in or via electronic means. The provider must directly supervise comprehensive perinatal health workers and document this supervision in the patient's record. Direct supervision must take place in person and on-site. The provider's protocols must define how each type of supervision takes place and is documented. CPSP enhanced services are provided with the client's input so that each client receives the information, services, and support she needs. It is important to personalize the information and services offered to each client, and to respect her social, cultural, religious, and economic concerns.

Due to the wide variety of CPSP programs and staff, it is highly recommended that you modify and adapt these information on requirements useful tools for developing and maintaining your CPSP practice.

This section is written for clients, who guidance on program elements as the orientation and care plan, and includes guidelines on how to deliver CPSP services to meet Health Education, Nutrition, Psychosocial, and If education, psychosocial, nutrition, or gestational diabetes expertise, the Steps help you screen and provide interventions for situations related to general, each guideline includes: n Goals n Back ground information n St eps to take n F ollow up n Referrals Client handoutsThere are the Nutrition section. Handouts are available in English and Spanish. Use these handouts when you discuss a topic with the client. The best way to use them is to read and discuss them with the client. If you send materials home with a client, be sure she can read and understand them, or has someone who can read them for her. Feel free to use other written materials to supplement the handouts. See the Low Literacy learn You languages most used by clients. FS | STEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSUse these Steps to Take guidelines with ....................... client has own unique concerns, way learning, experience, knowledge, strengths, and risks.here are essential elements to remember every time a CPSP staff person works with a client. These are: n B elieve that each client can help herself n F ocus on the client n L ook for the client's strengths and build on them n K eep an open mind n Suppor t the client's right to choose Steps to Take n Believe that each client can help herself I t is commonly accepted that the health care practitioner can help the client. However, the most effective interventions occur when both the health care practitioner and the client believe in the client's ability to help herself. Once the client lea ves your office, she only has herself to rely upon. When staff show confidence in the client and the client's abilities, the client is more likely to trust the staff and participate in the plan. For example: u T ake time to ask the client how she is feeling. Really listen to her as an individual. u L ook at the client, rather than looking through the chart, typing on the computer, or arranging pamphlets. B elieving that the client can truly help leads to the next step: focus on the client. n Focus on the client B y believing the client can help herself, the focus naturally shifts away from the CPSP staff and toward the client; first by understanding and identifying her goals and then by helping her to achieve them. No matt er what the issue is, begin by finding out what the client knows, what questions she has, her level of experience, and how she prefers to learn. Then, help her decide what more she needs to learn and provide her with the knowledge and skills she needs to help herself. For example: u Encourage client t o bring up her concerns or questions in the beginning. u Encourage her t o write a list of questions to ask the health care practitioner, so she can better remember them. u P rovide support and encouragement to a client who, for example, is very nervous at 15 weeks of pregnancy because her last pregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 16 weeks. It may be more appropriate not to spend time on other areas of her health education plan at this time. u D esign a different health education plan for a client who has never had a baby and prefers to read, as opposed to a woman who has had two babies and finds reading difficult. n Look for her strengths and build on them E very client has strengths. However, health care practitioners are trained to look for problems and solve them, so it takes a conscious effort to shift away from looking for risks to also looking for strengths. When an int eraction on the client,\" it is a two-way some For example: u C ommend a client who called in after spotting for two days. Her strength is that she understood that she should be checked. FS | of Every Client Interaction Use that understanding to teach her about calling right away if she feels any danger signs in the future. u A client ma y not know the anatomical names of her reproductive organs, she may have a lot of experience in supporting other women during their pregnancies. Her strength is that she knows what to expect as her body changes. u A client ma y continue to smoke or use other drugs throughout her pregnancy. Even if she is risking her health and the health of her baby, she has the right to make those decisions. Praise her for taking an interest in her pregnancy; encourage her to attend all of her appointments and to decrease her smoking/drug use to lessen the risks to herself and the baby. n Keep an open mind When talk ing with a client, take care to keep your own values and opinions out of the picture, even if some of her attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors seem new or unusual to you. For example: u List en with an open mind to cultural or religious beliefs about food or activities. This information will help when making a plan for the client's care. u E ven if a client is behaving in ways that you think are not appropriate for a pregnant woman her baby's health by seeking prenatal care. Support the client's right to choose Each w oman has the right to decide if she will participate in CPSP . All CPSP services are voluntary and a client can turn down any or all parts of these services. For example: u A client ma y choose not to learn all the details of labor and delivery. Accept that she prefers to let nature take its course. u A client can choose who she wants t o involve in her care. After explaining the client's right to confidential medical records and any legal limitations, it is important to explain what will be discussed in the visits so she can decide if she would like others to be involved in her care. For example, explain the sensitive topics that will be discussed if/when she wants to include others in her care. u A ccept a client's choice to quit school and stay home for the last three months of her pregnancy even though she is in good health.

Orientation Handouts When you perform an orientation on give the client an orientation handout, such as Welcome to Pregnancy Care (see the Health Education section of this manual). To emphasize a point, write on the pamphlet. Some items you might write down are: names of staff members or locations of related services (WIC, etc.). When you give handouts to a client, ask her to keep them readily available in case she needs the list of danger signs, phone numbers, or other information. Be sure your name, address, and phone number are on the handout.

It is best for women to begin care as early in the pregnancy as possible so that the initial assessment occurs and entry to care. Additional assessments should be conducted in the second and third or a combined three-part assessment totaling at least 90 minutes (all disciplines must be assessed). by Title 22. The Provider Handbook includes a list of these elements. All assessments and changes to assessment forms must be reviewed by the local area Perinatal Services Coordinator (PSC) for with practices. It is a best practice to refer clients with complex conditions to these experts for in-depth and referrals as needed. and completed reassessments are If a client declines the assessment, you must document this in her medical record. Continue to offer assessments or other CPSP services at subsequent visits when you feel she may be ready to participate. Document each invitation for n T he setting and ideally have a phone for communicating with outside resources. n T ry to put the client at ease. Introduce yourself and explain the purpose assessment. n A dopt a nonjudgmental, relaxed attitude. n T ell the client that her responses are part of her confidential medical record and will not be shared outside the health care team, with a few exceptions: u I f she has a plan to hurt herself or others. u I f she has physical injuries as a result of assault or abuse. u I f there is suspicion of abuse/neglect of a child, elder, or dependent adult. n A sk open-ended questions than a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.

If a client does not want to answer, document \"client declined to answer.\" n sensing when they are being judged. Be aware of your own attitudes and body language. Most clients are willing to answer, especially if they understand why the question is being asked. Explain that responses are voluntary; she may choose not to answer a specific question.

Follow up on referrals is documented on the ICP during reassessments or any other contact with the client. All CPSP providers must use an ICP that meets 22 requirements. The PSC can provide of ICPs that meet the guidelines.

If not, how is the plan going to be revised? Is she using the deep breathing What helping smoking? Is the problem now resolved? Interventions provided based site-specific protocols. The ICP must document care for interventions and referrals.This Teach-back Ask the client to \"teach-back\" the main points. With teach-back, you ask the client to teach you/explain the most important part of your message. For example, say: n \" Just to be sure I have explained the danger signs clearly, could you tell me the danger signs you remember and what you will do if you see them?\" n \" What suggestion on this handout seemed like something you could do to quit smoking?\" n \" Tell me what you will do now to help your nausea. \"s you educate clients, you can help them in the following ways: n P rovide necessary information n Help informed their pregnancies (see Helping Client Make Client with Behavior Change) This section will focus on the first point above, providing information. The goal is to provide information so the client learns what she needs to carry out a healthy pregnancy. Keep in mind, people learn in different ways, so no two clients will assimilate information in the same way. Learning New Information Overall, people remember: 10% of what they read 20% of what they hear 30% of what they see 50% of what they hear and see 70% of what they say or write 90% of what they say as they do a thing The more a person actively uses information, the more they will remember. Passive methods of learning, such as reading or Use active such the about how she likes to learn. One person may like to another may prefer having someone explain instructions. Some people may be terrified of groups, while others prefer group learning. Adjust the way you teach to each client's learning preferences when possible. Another important interest in the subject. For example, a client in her first trimester may not care about breast or bottle feeding; however, in her third trimester the same client may be very interested in how she will feed her infant. Find out what the client is interested in and provide information at the relevant time. Teaching Effectively You can be a more effective educator by remembering two things: (1) limit and focus the information you give and (2) involve the client. The following are some suggestions that will help you involve the client in your education session. The beginning n Establish rappor t. Ask the client how she is feeling or make a friendly comment. n F ind out if she has any concerns, and address her concerns. Page updated 2019 FS Effectivel The middle: what the heard a as , \"What do you know about breastfeeding?\" instead of, \"Do you plan to breastfeed?\" n Explain jar gon or unfamiliar words. n Giv e only the most essential information small \"bite-sized chunks.\" n A sk client understands after a chunk of information. n When a handout: u Explain the inf ormation in chunks. Name the topic before you give the details of each chunk. u H ighlight any important points a pencil, or colored highlighter. u A sk the client to circle or point out what is important to her. n When t eaching skills, show and tell. u F or example, show and tell the client how to use a condom or how to perform prenatal exercises. The end n R eview the main points. n A sk the client to show you any skills you've taught. For example: u A sk the client show you how to do kick counts or safe lifting techniques. u A sk the client to how she will ask her partner to smoke outside to avoid second hand smoke.n A sk the client to \"teach-back\" the main points. For example, say: u \" Just to be sure I have explained the danger signs clearly, could you tell me the danger signs you remember and what you will do if you see them?\" u \" What suggestion on this handout seemed like something you could do to quit smoking?\" u \" Tell me what you will do now to help your nausea.\" n A sk the client what questions she has. Open-ended questions One easy way open-ended to find out what a client has learned or knows. Open-ended questions start with words like, \"what, \" \"tell me, \" or \"how. \" By using these types of questions, you are not allowing a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Instead, you are drawing out a longer response. Try not to start questions with words like, \"do you, \" with, \"How do you like to learn new things?\" instead of, \"Do you like to read? n T ry, \"What will you do when you want to count your baby's kicks?\" instead of, \"Can you count your baby's kicks?\" n U se, \"How does your partner feel about your pregnancy?\" instead of, \"Is your partner happy about your pregnancy?\" Page updated 2019 | 19 STEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSMaking Successful R eferrals n some cases, you will need to refer a client to an outside resource that specializes in a particular kind of service or focus area. After making a referral, follow up at a later visit Explain r eferral and how the referral meets a need she has identified. n D escribe the process of the referral (what has to happen before she can receive services). n P raise her for taking care of herself. Try to relieve any embarrassment she might feel as a result of seeing another practitioner. If she has formed an attachment to you, she might be reluctant to see someone else. Let her know you will still see her at upcoming prenatal visits. When you or the client agency, find out the following as necessary: n Who is ser ved? Are there any age limits or other restrictions? n Ar e people seen on a drop-in basis or is an appointment required? n Ho w long will it take to get an appointment? n Is ther e a waiting list? n Is ther e a cost? What is the cost? Is there a sliding scale for people who have limited resources? n What ar e the staff's language capabilities? n Wher e are their offices located? n Which public transpor tation options are nearby? n What ar e their hours and days of service? You may need to teach the client how to make an appointment. Show her how to ask for the name of the person she's being referred to and how to make notes about what she is told.Prepare Her for Barriers She May Experience Ask if she thinks she will have any problems in following through with the referral such as transportation, childcare, or other barriers. Find out if the client has a calendar and a clock to help her keep appointments. See if she has a map, bus schedule or a corresponding phone application, and be sure she knows how to use it to locate the agency. Consider her literacy skills. What If She Won't Go? Do your best to make an appropriate referral and encourage her to accept it. Ask her to share with you any potential barriers that may keep her from following through on the referral. Document your efforts. In cases where the client is a danger to herself or others, see Psychosocial Emotional Health Concerns. If a client she doesn't need help or he feels you can't help with her problems, she may not want to see someone from an outside agency. Know the limits of your counseling experience and explain those limits to her. Set boundaries. If she becomes overly dependent, she will be less likely to accept outside help and receive an appropriate of care.

Page updated 2019This page Different Ages lient caseloads are often made up of people from different age groups. At different ages, people are in different stages of emotional development, physical growth, have different ways of thinking and making decisions, and have varying levels of abilities when it comes to getting along with others. Knowing a client's age and paying attention to how she thinks, and others are helpful when choosing the most effective approaches for working with her. Adolescents (13-18) Pregnancy interrupts a teen's normal growth, development processes, a crucial stage of life. It requires the teen's body to expend energy developing a new life instead of devoting that energy to her physical growth. A teen also must face the adult responsibilities of parenthood when she would ordinarily be learning how to make decisions and relate to others. Thinking and reasoning traits n An adolescent t ends decisions are seldom based on fear of punishment or fear of adult disapproval. n Her vie w of everything is in relation to herself; she is self-focused and unable to see herself as others see her; the world revolves around her.

In some cases, the client's decisions may be influenced by a family member (such as mother or mother-in-law) or by a group (such as her spiritual support system, co-workers, etc.). Find out who influences her decisions and how strong that influence is. Take that into consideration when you talk with her about her decisions. Many decisions can be worked out her choices clearly u List all the benefits and bar riers she can think of for each choice u Stat e her values as they relate to each choice F or example, if a client is trying to decide whether to breastfeed or not, she may tell you that she feels strongly about wanting what is best for her baby. She is also concerned about whether she can make enough milk, her modesty, and a need for independence. 2. Clar ify information about her choices to help her make a decision F or the client above who is trying to whether might tell her: u Br east does determine the quantity of breast milk (frequency of feeding does). u O ther people can give a bottle to a breastfed baby (the mother can pump breast milk for a bottle). u A w oman's modesty can be protected and her breasts do not have to be exposed during breastfeeding. No w the client can re-evaluate her beliefs. She can understand how strongly she feels about it and has the information she needs to balance with those beliefs. 3. I nclude \"significant as appropriate. to bring a family member or someone important to one or more office visits. Let her know that her supportive relationships are important. For example: u I nvite a family member to come along to learn about breastfeeding. u I nvite a family member who smokes to come along and learn about ways to help avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. 4. F ollow up with the client about her decision next time you see her. If she still is undecided, let her know it can take time to make a decision and repeat steps 1, 2, Beha her time in prenatal care, a client may want to change her behavior. For example, she may want to change her smoking habits, or her habit of missing scheduled prenatal appointments, or the way their just like CPSP staff; we all change our behavior when we are ready. People approach a change in behavior in stages. At some points in time, clients are far away from being ready to change. At other stages, change is the next step! The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (also called the Stages of Change Model) explains how people change. Why is this model helpful to CPSP staff? Once you assess which stage a client is in, you can help her move toward her desired change in behavior. The Stages of Change are: n Pre-contemplation n Contemplation n Preparation n Action n Maintenance n Relapse Think of these stages as parts of a cycle. Ideally, change. not thinking about changing their behavior. Often, they do not want to change because they don't see the behavior as a problem. A client in this stage may You can assess which stage the client is in by asking questions encourage to her behavior. say, \"I don't think I need to stop smoking. I smoked all through my first pregnancy and my daughter is now 6 years old and has no problems.\" To help a client in this stage: Discuss the problem in the abstract. Do not talk about the client's behavior, but talk in a general way about other people who have felt the same way. Talk about statistics. The goal is to give the client some food for thought, so she can move to the next stage, contemplation. Contemplation: In the changing their behavior. A client in this stage may say, \"Yes, I know I should stop smoking, BUT...\" To help a client in this stage: Discuss the pros and cons of changing behavior. Help the client to brainstorm ways to overcome each con. The goal is to help the client feel she can overcome the cons, so she can move to the next stage and prepare to change. Preparation: In this stage, a client is preparing to take action in the immediate future. She has taken some steps toward changing her behavior. Her preparations may include talking to others to get advice or support, or setting a personal goal such as cutting down to fewer cigarettes. To desired change and brainstorm ways that she can overcome them. The goal is to help her make a plan to overcome any barriers and move to the next stage - action. Page updated 2019 FS | 32 STEPS TAKEFIRST STEPSHelping a with client changing her behavior. She is trying her new behavior. To help a client in this stage: Applaud her actions. The goal is to help her continue her new behavior and prevent relapse. Discuss any change. You might ask, \"What is the hardest part about (your new behavior)?\" Brainstorm ways that she can overcome the barriers. Reinforce benefits of her new behavior. You might ask, \"What is the best part about (your new behavior)?\" Maintenance: In the maintenance stage, a client has made the change and continued it for six months. To help a client in this stage: Continue to give the praise. any Relapse: A client may relapse after changing her behavior when she encounters a setback. Depending on the strength of the setback, she may go back to any of the stages of change. To help a client in relapse: Be understanding. Explain that relapse is common, and that it usually takes a person several tries to make a behavior change that is well integrated into their life. Talk with the client to find out which stage she is in now. Guide her using the suggestions for that stage. Remember, behavior change occurs time. CPSP clients are seen multiple times throughout their pregnancy and into the postpartum period. In these visits, CPSP staff have a unique opportunity to help clients move closer to changing their behavior by nudging them along the stages of change. Page updated 2019 FS | 33 STEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSCultural to the client's culture. Culture may be thought of as a way of life belonging to a particular group of people. It includes behaviors, attitudes, values, and beliefs that are shared by that group and passed down from generation to generation. There is linguistic and cultural diversity within a particular ethnic group, and there are differences in the extent to which an individual practices her cultural behaviors or traditions. One of the most important cultural influences for the client is her ethnic background, but she may be part of other groups that have cultural influence on her life. These include her religion, education, social and economic status, citizenship or immigration status, age, sexual orientation, marital status, her original family and current family structures, where she was raised or lives (urban, rural, suburban), emotional status, current trends, and lifestyle. All of these factors influence her health, beliefs, and practices. If you are not familiar with a certain culture, let the client know. Show respect for her culture and express your interest in learning more about the beliefs and values associated with that culture. See Cross Cultural Communication to find techniques for communicating with someone from a culture different from your own. We all have personal beliefs and tend to make judgments about other people. Avoid negative stereotypes of different groups of people such as ethnic groups, women on welfare, and people addicted to substances. Be aware of your own attitudes and how your personal history might affect your work. Try to view all of your clients as individuals worthy of your STEPSCross-Cultural Communication uch of the communication within the clinic is between people of different cultures. This page will discuss steps you can take to bridge cultural differences when talking to clients and staff. Steps to Take These are steps you can take to be prepared to communicate with staff and clients of different cultures. n B e aware of stereotypes and your prejudices about other people and cultures. Read Cultural Considerations on the previous page. n Use language suppor t resources, such as translating or interpreting services (see Resources in the Cross Cultural Communications and Dealing with Language Barriers sections). n R ely on cultural experts. Identify people who are knowledgeable about the culture of your clients. Ask them to you in a population. Find out as much as you can about cultural rules for the groups that come to the clinic for services. When talking with clients CPSP staff should keep these seven recommendations communicate effectively with clients of varying cultures: 1. B e aware of your own biases 2. E valuate the client for language assistance Establish information respectfully: \"Tell earn about and appreciate different communication styles 7. F ind out the role of family1. B e aware of your own biases Explor e stereotypes and prejudices about other people and cultures you may harbor. 2. E valuate the client for language assistance needs needs language assistance, provide an interpreter. See No Language in Common with Staff and Working with Interpreters. 3. E stablish rapport T ake a few minutes at the beginning of the visit for \"small talk.\" This will let the client get used to the setting and establishes common ground. Small talk is an important part of communication in many cultures. A client may want to share her feelings about her long trip to the clinic, recent holiday celebrations, or her problems with her mother-in-law. Small talk establishes a connection and lets the client more \"How you has your week gone?\" 4. Resp ect different cultures Sho w respect. Be open and willing to understand other people's needs, health beliefs, and health practices. Explain that Western or conventional medicine is just one kind of health care. Other health care models can be just as effective. Accept the client's health beliefs, attitudes, and health practices. Some of her health beliefs may be based on different cultural practices. Explain t ests and treatments in ways that make the worldview. C ollect information respectfully: \"Tell me more\" A client 's cultural background may not be obvious. Invite her to talk about her culture, family situation, and about the people who give her advice. A sk the client about any alternative health practices, medicines, or herbs she may be taking. Page FS | 36 STEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSCross-Cultural Communication This information is important for her treatment plan. While some alterative health practices may be positive, others could be dangerous. Using the phrase , \"Tell me more ...\" is a respectful way to talk clients. It shows that you are open and willing to understand more about the client. It helps you collect important information for her treatment plan. For example, you might say: n \" Tell me more about what you are doing to prepare for a healthy baby.\" n \" Tell me more about the herbal remedies you use to ease your morning sickness.\" n \" Tell me more about what you might like to do to relax during early labor.\" S ee Little Experience with Western Care in the Psychosocial section for more questions you can ask to find out about the client's beliefs and experiences. 6. L earn about and appreciate different communication styles Silence S ome people use silence to let an emotion pass, or to think about what to say next. Different cultures have different traditions for \"pause time.\" Watch the client to see how she uses silence. Do not jump in to fill a silent pause with small talk. Non- verbal communication S ome kinds of touching, handshakes, eye and influence the cultural rules. Some clients may smile or laugh to cover other emotions or to avoid conflict. T ake your clues from the client as to how close she wants to sit, or whether or not she touches you or looks directly at \" Yes\" means... S ome clients reply \"yes\" even when they do not necessarily understand or plan to do what is being discussed. In some cultures, it may be a way of offering respect.

Pause often and let the interpreter interpret. n A sk one question at a time. n A void interrupting the interpretation. n I f you don't want it interpreted, don't say it. n I f you want to talk to the interpreter, first tell the client that you will be talking to the interpreter. n Explain t echnical terms such as C-section, 46 STEPS TO TAKEFIRST STEPSGuidelines for Using Interpreters n I f the concept is complex, it may work better to explain the whole thing to the interpreter and then let her explain it to the client. n W atch the client for nonverbal cues, such as avoiding eye contact, crossing arms, and looking down. n A sk the client questions such as, \"Tell me R eview important points by saying, \"Let me tell you what I have heard, to be sure I understand clearly ...\" sure she your main points. Ask the client to teach you/explain the most important part of your message. (See Educating Effectively for a more detailed description of the teach back method.) Working with an Untrained Interpreter There may be times when you will not be able to obtain the services of a trained interpreter. This is not ideal, but it may be the only way to talk with the client. Speak with the Untrained Interpreter Follow the guidelines for working with all interpreters and add these steps: n T ry to assess the interpreter's level of English language skills and her ability to interpret. n A sk the interpreter to interpret everything you say. n I f the interpreter and the client get into a conversation, ask the interpreter to inform you of what was discussed. n I nterrupt the interpreter if you think the interpreter is getting off the subject or not completing the interpretation.Working with a Telephone Interpreter Working with a telephone interpreter is different than working with an interpreter in person. You don't have direct contact with the interpreter and you may have to pass the phone back and forth between you and the client, unless you have a speakerphone.

They have never been to a clinic or hospital, and have always used the services of traditional healers. These women may have a lot of experience and knowledge about pregnancy, birth, and infant care. They may have had babies at home with a midwife or they may have never been pregnant or given birth. Western health care is based or eating certain foods. How to Assess the Need Ask about the client's past use of Western health care services during the initial health education assessment. If she has little or no experience with them, find out what beliefs and experiences she has had with other non-Western health care. Ask questions like: n What k inds of things do you do when you get sick? n What did y our family do for you when you were little and got sick? n Ar e there healers in your community who help sick people? Are there women who help care for the new mother and baby? n Ha ve you used their services? n Ha ve you been pregnant before or had a baby at home? n Ha ve you seen a baby being born?

La inducci\u00f3n del parto ocurre cuando a una mujer embarazada le dan medicamentos o emplean otros m\u00e9todos para iniciar su parto antes de que pase naturalmente . Su m\u00e9dico puede decidir inducirle el parto por algunas de las siguientes razones: n E l embarazo ha durado m\u00e1s de 42 semanas n T iene la presi\u00f3n arterial elevada n S e le rompe la fuente antes de tiempo n No tiene suficient e l\u00edquido alrededor de su beb\u00e9 n E l beb\u00e9 no est\u00e1 creciendo bien n T iene problemas de salud, como la diabetes, que puede da\u00f1arla a usted o a su beb\u00e9 Algunas mujeres piden que sus m\u00e9dicos les induzcan el parto por motivos que no son m\u00e9dicos, por ejemplo: n P ara tener al beb\u00e9 temprano porque est\u00e1 cansada de estar embarazada n P ara tener al beb\u00e9 cuando est\u00e1n sus familiares y amigos presentes n P ara coordinar el nacimiento del beb\u00e9 con sus d\u00edas de trabajo n P ara tener al beb\u00e9 temprano para que su m\u00e9dico pueda estar en el partoNo es una buena idea inducir el parto si no hay problemas con el embarazo.La inducci\u00f3n del parto puede afectar la salud de su beb\u00e9 . Debido a que puede ser dif\u00edcil saber la fecha en que qued\u00f3 embarazada, la inducci\u00f3n del parto puede hacer que su beb\u00e9 nazca demasiado temprano . Los beb\u00e9s que nacen demasiado temprano pueden tener problemas para respirar y quiz\u00e1s necesiten atenci\u00f3n adicional . Cuando la inducci\u00f3n del parto no funciona, es posible que tenga que tener un parto por ces\u00e1rea . Si su m\u00e9dico sugiere que le induzcan el parto, pregunte lo siguiente: n \u00bfP or qu\u00e9 me tienen que inducir el parto? n \u00bfC u\u00e1les son los posibles riesgos para m\u00ed y para mi beb\u00e9 si me inducen el parto? n \u00bfP uedo esperar a tener el beb\u00e9 naturalmente sin inducci\u00f3n? n \u00bfHa y alguna otra opci\u00f3n?

For a more complete picture of what the woman ate in the last 24 hours, follow these steps: Before you begin, always explain what you are going to do . I am going to ask you to tell me everything you ate and drank during the last 24 hours. I will ask questions to get the most accurate food intake possible.

Please be sure you tell me everything you ate or drank, even the small things like butter, salad dressings, cream, and candies, so I can give you the best healthy eating information possible.

It is up to the child welfare agency whether or not they will investigate the case . When a report has been made, the Mandated Reporter has followed the law by reporting . If the victim is now an adult and the abuse took place when the victim was younger than 18 years of age, a Mandated Reporter is not required to report the past abuse . However, if there are other children in the home of the abuser and there is a reasonable suspicion that these children may be currently in danger, a Mandated Reporter is required to report this as a possible danger to these children to the local child welfare agency . Cultural Differences Be aware of different cultural attitudes toward child raising and discipline .

The teen may be placed in a foster home or special teen shelter . Steps to Take Reporting Suspected Abuse and Neglect Consult your clinical supervisor immediately if you have any suspicions that a child is experiencing abuse or neglect . This should take place before the family leaves the office . It is extremely important for all CPSP offices and clinics to have Policies and Procedures in place on how they will handle Mandated Reporting in their practice . The Perinatal Service Coordinator in your local health jurisdiction will ask to see site specific Protocols, which should reflect this practice . If you or your supervisor are unclear as to whether the case should be reported to the authorities, one of you should call your local child welfare agency for a \"telephone consultation\" to discuss the case . Remember to document the results of the phone consultation in the chart, including the date, time, agency and representative with whom you consulted, and advised during the consult . If your supervisor will file the report , this will meet the mandate; however, always keep documentation that a report has been made within the time required by law . If your supervisor disagrees with a need for a mandated report and you still reasonably suspect a child is being abused or neglected, a Mandated reporter would still be required by law to report the suspicion of abuse and a non-mandated reporter is not liable for making a report based upon reasonable suspicion (as this is allowable by California law, and best when done in accordance with your practice protocols) through the mandated reporting law requirements .

However, in most cases, it is better to let the family know what is going to be reported and why . Remind them that in your first meeting you said all discussions would be confidential, with the exceptions as required by law, such as if you suspected someone was being harmed . You need to take steps to protect the child and get help for the caregiver(s) . Ask if they want to be present when the call is made to child welfare. This can be helpful in maintaining communication with them in a time of crisis . Tell them you want to help them find a successful resolution for the abuse or When reporting, a Mandated must give his/her name (which will be confidential unless the court orders the report be released to representatives involved with the case) . Non-mandated reporters functioning in the role of a Mandated Reporter may report the suspected abuse at the time the abuse is discovered . PSY | 62 STEPS TO TAKEPSYCHOSOCIALChild Abuse and Neglect If the situation is very serious and you feel the child is in immediate danger, call your local child abuse reporting line immediately . If there is no immediate danger to the child, a Mandated Reporter is required report it as soon as possible by phone . Look in the White Pages of the phone book under County Social Services for the reporting phone number . Or you may find the number in the government pages of the phone book, under the county section; look for Department of Social Services or Department of Children and Family Services .
