The main risk of treatment with NTZ is the possibility of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, the number of NTZ infusions. This risk decreases with the extended interval (EDI), which involves 9 or fewer infusions/year. However, it is a matter of controversy as to whether EDI remains effective in reducing recurrences and the presence of new lesions imaging (MRI). Patients and observational study from April 2019 to 30 June 2021, following up patients on NTZ treatment who switched to EDI. Patients should have at least one MRI six months after the start of EDI. The presence of attacks or MRI activity (new lesions in T2) during the EDI was Twenty-three patients with a mean age of 43.5 \u00b1 9.4 years were included. The median number of NTZ infusions was 68 (minimum, 25; maximum, 127). The median interval between the start of the EDI and the last MRI was 14 months (minimum, 6; maximum, 25), and 23 months from the visit (minimum, 7; maximum, 28).
