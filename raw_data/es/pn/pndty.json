El objetivo de este estudio es conocer la historia natural de los pacientes sometidos a una amputaci\u00f3n infracond\u00edlea (AIC) y comparar su evoluci\u00f3n a lo largo de 2 d\u00e9cadas, as\u00ed como los factores predictores de supervivencia, protetizaci\u00f3n, y amputaci\u00f3n contralateral.M\u00e9todos Estudio retrospectivo de 209 pacientes consecutivos (edad media 72,9 a\u00f1os, varones 67,9%) sometidos a AIC a lo largo de 2 periodos: 1996-2005 y 2006-2015. Se valor\u00f3 mediante an\u00e1lisis de supervivencia la protetizaci\u00f3n, el riesgo de amputaci\u00f3n contralateral y la supervivencia, as\u00ed como sus factores predictores.Resultados Se realizaron 133 AIC en el 1996-2005 y 106 en el 2006-2015. La etiolog\u00eda global que motiv\u00f3 la AIC fue por isquemia aguda (4,3%), cr\u00f3nica (34%), infecci\u00f3n (9,1%) o mixta (cr\u00f3nica+infecci\u00f3n, 52,6%), sin diferencias entre periodos. Se incrementaron las revascularizaciones previas entre ambas d\u00e9cadas del 31,6 al 54,3%. Supervivencia: mortalidad a un mes=9,2%; un a\u00f1o=31,9%; 2 a\u00f1os=43,8% y 5 a\u00f1os=63,9%, sin diferencias significativas entre ambos periodos. Protetizaci\u00f3n: tasa de protetizaci\u00f3n global del 44,5% durante todo el seguimiento, sin diferencias significativas entre ambos periodos. Lograron deambular el 41,1% de los pacientes. Amputaci\u00f3n contralateral: El 20,1% de los pacientes requirieron posteriormente una amputaci\u00f3n mayor contralateral, sin hallar diferencias significativas entre ambos periodos.Conclusiones En la \u00faltima d\u00e9cada han disminuido las AIC probablemente por un incremento del intervencionismo de revascularizaci\u00f3n previo. A pesar de ello, no se modificaron los resultados de protetizaci\u00f3n, amputaci\u00f3n contralateral o supervivencia. En cualquier caso, el n\u00famero de pacientes que llegan a alcanzar la deambulaci\u00f3n es modesto, por lo que se subraya la necesidad de una \u00f3ptima selecci\u00f3n del paciente tributario a AIC con el objetivo de protetizarse. Every year, more than one million people in the world require major limb amputation, which is one amputation made in made critical limb the aggressive medical-surgical approach of diabetic foot is of patients who require major lower extremity amputation. For these patients, the main treatment objective is to achieve the best possible quality of life by preserving independence through the ability to walk. [2](#bib0065) Although the benefits and the cognitive status and associated pathologies are related not only to performed in patients where both lower extremities are at risk, and, to date, the literature on the evolution of the contralateral limb is quite scarce and discouraging. [6](#bib0085) Knowing the risk factors associated not only with the stump but also with medium-term patient survival, prosthetic use and evolution of the contralateral limb can be of great importance in the process of indicating BKA and avoiding expectations of unrealistic functional recovery. The objective of the present study is to analyze the cohort of patients who underwent BKA at our hospital over the last 20 years in order to determine factors associated with prosthetic fitting, survival BKA between January 1996 and December 2015 at a single hospital. They were divided into 2 periods: those carried out from 1996 to 2005 and those performed from 2006 to 2015. The data were obtained from medical records and telephone contact with patients or their family members. The variables collected included demographic data (age, sex), clinical history (diabetes heart Rehabilitation Service for adaptation), as well as the date of ambulation annotated by this department.Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS\u00ae version 22 for Windows by IBM\u00ae. For the descriptive analysis, the mean and standard deviation were used for the quantitative variables, and frequency and percentages were used for qualitative variables. The comparison between groups was done with Student's t test for quantitative variables and the chi-squared or Fisher's test for ratio P value of less than .05 was We performed 239 consecutive BKA in 209 patients: 133 BKA from 1996 to 2005, and 106 BKA from 2006 to 2015. The procedure was bilateral in 30 patients and simultaneous in one case. Clinical Characteristics. Mean age was 71.88 and 67.9% The of the study, the higher Survival. were fitted with prostheses, and 41.1% of the total were able to complete the rehabilitation process and walk. There were lower rate of prosthetic use. Contralateral Amputation. Out of the total of 209 operated patients, follow-up, amputations). The 'absence of amputation' rates of the contralateral limb were 88%, 82% and 72% after one, 2 and 5 years in the period 1996-2005 and 86%, 82% and 76% in the period 2006-2015, respectively; no statistically of patients who underwent BKA over a period of 2 decades. Since BKA is usually associated with a more complex postoperative convalescence than above-knee terms of survival, prosthetic use, or future need for major patients in the 2 decades of study, we observed how comorbidity has generally increased in all the variables studied. Diabetes mellitus is especially relevant (although without reaching as is chronic kidney failure in since, in addition to having almost doubled, it has been shown to be a significant prognostic factor for both survival and the risk of contralateral amputation. The high prevalence of comorbidities in these patients is in line with results from previous series [3,6,8](#bib0070); the same is true of critical limb ischemia, associated or not with infection, being the main causal factor. [5,9](#bib0080) We observed a significant increase in revascularization procedures going 31.6% to 54.3% of patients. It should noted the expense of revascularization techniques, which have gone from being practically anecdotal in the first period to exceeding the number of open surgery procedures in the second. This fact reflects a probable increase in the indications for revascularization in patients with critical ischemia, associated or not with diabetic foot syndrome, and there is currently the related to the 22% drop between the 2 decades of the number of patients who have required BKA as the this could also be indicative that there are currently more possibilities of expectancies were low, and just over one-third of patients were alive after 5 years. Furthermore, despite slightly more than patients managed to walk with their prosthesis. These data only emphasize the palliative nature of this type of procedure, which is also related to the significant comorbidity population presents. Although these data may seem dismal, they are in line with other reports published to date ( [Table that, in patients candidates for major amputation of a limb, it is important to preserve the knee due to the lower energy expenditure associated with the use of a prosthesis after BKA is the patient to achieve independent mobility. However, as demonstrated in this study and in the previous publications, less than half of patients achieve Additionally, in many cases, the of this amputation the prosthetic for individuals, it might be advisable to For instance, above-knee amputation may be a less postoperative morbidity that should be considered. [3,8](#bib0070) Due to the limitations of our study, it would be risky and unreliable to try to establish a score to discriminate these cases. But it does indicate factors clinician and decision in the critical situation of an amputation. On the other hand, BKA is often performed in patients with both limbs at risk, either due to critical limb ischemia or diabetes. The high of within 5 years of the initial major amputation. The main limitations of the present study are its retrospective, single-center nature and the limited patient sample. Although it provides an overall idea of how the history of amputee patients has evolved and the the of BKA has decreased over the last decade, probably due to the the last 10-20 Certain factors associated with poor vital or functional prognosis may help reassess the indication for this patients more palliative of amputation.Funding This study has received no specific as: Marcos Garc\u00eda L, Mateos Torres E, Velescu A, D\u00edaz Duran C, Lacambra Pe\u00f1art M, Clar\u00e1 Velasco A.
