These are conscious and ceremonial forays into mountains of spiritual value in tradition, with the aim that walking is an offering both to obtain healing and to achieve clarity on some matter. Mountain work is not simply a physical activity but it promotes a state of consciousness and contemplation that allows us to acquire observations that are very useful for our lives. At the same time that it is a collective activity where each participant is restrained, it where one manages to deepen their thoughts and ideas thanks to the energy of nature. WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS? Physical conditioning is an important point, but not the only one. The oxygenation that the mountains make possible as well as the contact with the sun promotes multiple physical benefits. At the same time, it is a practice that encourages deep meditation, with all the emotional and mental benefits that all meditation generates. On a magical level, it is an experience that naturally allows the transmutation of dense energy and often the of symptoms that limit the life of the person. WHERE IS IT DONE? We do them in different hills and mountains, such as El Nevado de Toluca, Iiztaccihuatl, El Quemado in Real de 14 and others like them. The walks can be from half a day to two full days with camping included. WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC LIKE? The mountain works have as a formal starting point the request for permission to the spirit of the place, delivering an offering to enter its natural space. The walk will be together taking care of the whole group, having moments of silence and introspection and others where it is shared among all. We will have different spaces for rest and contemplation, and many times we may combine it with other medicines and meditation such as drum work. REQUIREMENTS Depending on the difficulty of the mountain to visit, you should talk with the interested person about their health and physical condition. The truth is that it is not necessary to have experience or be an athlete, since the work is not about physical prowess but about spiritual work.
