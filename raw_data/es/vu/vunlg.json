This movie has to do with a nutritional program by Dr. Max Gerson and his natural therapy that, according to the Gerson Institute, many people have used to heal some chronic diseases in the USA. In order to develop this project, we have used some different methods. used on this research is mainly quali since go analyzing as evaluating a logical deduction and rhetorical some the numerous social and cultural benefits that we all may get from this translation. It is also descriptive and explanatory, as we illustrate the details about the whole translation process and the tools applied herein. It is also informative for the reason that one of the main ideas of this project, besides the translation process itself, is to contribute to the field of translation studies by providing the research community with thorough research work annotations the Translation is a process that consists of converting a text from one language to another w hile keeping the meaning of the original text. To be able to do that in a systematic way, several techniques need to be learned. This project, which is about translating the documentary movie The Beautiful Truth , is a reflection of the application of all t he translation methods, tools, and techniques learned during our academic program. Translating a movie presents the challenge of translating its script while keeping the translation into the context given by its video, and in this way conveying the intende d message of the movie. As a fundamental basis for this project, we are carrying out Annotated Translation which is a scientific process that goes beyond simply translating a text, by the problematic expressions, sentences source text, making a deeper analysis, and offering solutions to some problems that the source text may present when it is being translated into the target language. The annotations are done by creating comments, usually a few se ntences long, establishing a summary for and expressing the relevance of each part of the source that needs a closer look. According to the Gerson Institute representatives, there is a lot of information about their natural health treatment that needs to b e translated into Spanish, including the movie The Beautiful Truth . The translation of this movie from English to Spanish is expected to benefit the Spanish -speaking people by helping them to overcome the language barrier and providing The Beautiful Truth 2 access to a natural alternative therapy that claims to cure patients with cancer and other degenerative diseases. Statement of the Since the movie which contains the Spanish -speaking community cannot get the benefits from it and neither the field of nutrition and scientific development in our society. Objectives a) General Objective To offer an annotated translation for the Spanish -speaki ng community to have access to the movie The Beautiful Truth so that they are able to get the benefit offered in that information. b) Specific Objectives - To translate the script from English to Spanish providing an analysis through annotations. - To inf orm about the population who the project will be intended for, in this case, the Spanish -speaking Community. - To explore the benefits of the translation for this community. The Beautiful Truth 3 CHAPTER I 1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK (LITERATURE REVIEW) 1.1. Referential Framework Since the content of this informative documentary movie The Beautiful Truth is in English, the majority of the Spanish -speaking community is unaware of the existence of the Gerson Therapy, which , according to the Gerson Institute, is a natural alternativ e program to cure some degenerative diseases . Some people who have been convinced by their doctors that they are terminally ill would be pleased to know that there is still hope. Others who suffer by undergoing the harsh are gentler methods available to them. In order to give a solution to this problem, volunteer translators f rom the Catholic University of Santiago de Guayaquil offer their services to the Gerson Institute, rend ering the Spanish translation of the information from the movie, applying the techniques learned in the degree study program and giving an extensive analysis and offering solutions to any translation problem. Therefore, the translation of the movie into Sp anish will make the information accessible to more people; and the opportunity of having this alternative treatment available may increase the number of people who would benefit from it . It will also help to contribute to the improvement of the field of nutrition by transmitting this scientific information from the American to the Spanish -speaking community , where we as translator s are the fundamental transmitter s. The Beautiful Truth 4 When translating a movie several aspects have to considered carefully . Translation is a mu lti-step process that must be carried out by a professional, follows the of the and language, as cultural references, among many othe r aspects involved. Some time ago , The Gerson Institute had some problems with mistranslation services , by a volunteer translator, who translated a book from English into Spanish and he did not have a good knowledge about Translation and the different tec hniques it involves, so the result was badly translated information, and the book was not published because the Institute verified the information with someone who knew Spanish and realized it was not an accurate translation; the translator had not transmi tted the same message from the original source. Since then, the institute has been looking for someone professional to help them transmit their information from web pages, videos, books, among other materials. The Gerson Institute, located in the United S tates, did not considered the fact that the most famous means around the world for transmitting information is through web pages with free and user -friendly access for people all over the world to get any kind of information from different countries. Nowadays, they have been planning to expand their information for the Spanish Community since they know that there is a good demand for having information available in Spanish around the world. The Beautiful Truth 5 This year 50 million Hispanics in the US hold nearly $1 trillion i n purchasing power. As the US and purchasing power grows, it has become increasingly companies in certain industries to translate their websites into Spanish. (Diaz, countries in the world . The darker the color blue, the more populated the country is with Spanish -speaking people. Besides, i n Table 1, the count ries are listed their 28,674,757 28,199,822 16,598,074 project of translating the Gerson's information has become one of their main priorities, and they are even thinking of continuing translating the rest of their information into Spanish in the near future. In order to translate the movie accurately, we have used different translation techniques by following some steps, and using some tools and methods which facilitate us to understand this whole translation scheme. We are using Annotations as a scientific method to explain the choices we believe are the most accurate ones, by categorizing them accordingly, which means that we are analyzing the that each of these choices may encounter . According to the requirements for a postgraduate degree in Literary Translation of the Trinity College Dublin : The Beautiful Truth 7 An annotated translation should have a the of what a translation with some theoretical points, and suggesting particular tw with the text type The purpose of carrying out an annotated translation mainly has to do with the fact that it allows translators to develop translation skills by presenting not only the translated product itself, but so their it involves translation process. The function of an annotated translation is to offer a deeper analysis on the translation process of a given text. Likewi se, this critical reflection can function as an approximation to the translated text which emphasizes the internal structure of the text, and not only that, but this reflection also acts as a theoretical and methodological of the proposed translation. To develop the annotation for our translation, we have considered the following aspects which have been translated from Rosas (n.d.): - Formal A spects, which refer to grammar issues ( for example, type of vocabulary, syntactic structur e, etc.), and also of st ylistic nature (is the text to be translated a story, a poem, or a scientific text?, w hat are the stylistic conventions in which the text is adapted to ; for instance, if it is a sonnet or if it was written during the Romanticism , etc. - Rhetorical A spects: In this case, it is about how the text is written. Which is its internal structure, its expository scheme?, what kind of ideas it addresses or discuss es and how does it do it?, w hat kind of images use or The Beautiful Truth 8 create and how does it use or build them?, a re ther e any recurring elements?, w hat kind of tropes are present, how do they work and what is their function? - Thematic Aspects : The question to consider here is: what is the text about? As well, it is necessary to establish a relationship the such as, biographical, historical or critical information that documents the work of the author of the text, it is also important to include information and reflections about the contexts in which the texts are placed or inserted in both source and target cultures (type of publication, audience to whom the text is intended to, etc.). Such information must be relevant to the text we are working with. On the other hand, whichever the aspects tr anslators decide to work with, they must not forget that this analysis is about annotations, and that critical perspective has to be oriented to explain them by relationship of rela tion proces s; i.e., it is not impo rtant to talk about the text itself, but showing how the intrinsic characteristics of the text affects and are affected by its translation. Annotations can also be done within the same language , by analyzing some aspects and problems that language may within specific contexts and according to particular situations , or between two languages as in this case of the translation of our script . Moreover, they can be carried out The Beautiful Truth 9 within the translated text, through footnotes or separa tely by categorizing the problems, giving an analysis, citing and comparing both pieces of translation from the source and target text. For the translation of th is script, we have decided to do it order to solve these translation problems, it is fundamental to do it at a professional level considering different theories involved in this process according to different experts and linguists. These theories include two different concepts within this as communicative and semantic translation introduced by Newmark (1981), which we have used for the translation of the movie script , and also other comparable approaches by Nida (1964) and Jakobson (1959) . As it is known, the main purpose of a documentary movie is to inform some aspect of reality, mainly for the intentio ns of instruction or preserving a historical record. In addition, since this movie contains interviews to some experts, live experiments, and real images which demonstrate a number of those authentic facts, it is essential translators, to convey the most accurate contextual meaning of the original message. As a result, the target audience will receive the intended script content its an effect as close as possible to that obtained on the readers of the original.\" (Newmark, 1981, p. 39). According to this description, communicative translation focuses on the reader. Therefore, it is clear that this type of translation consists of conveying the same message from the original language by using the most natural equivalents into the target language , and etc; for instance, the fin al product of a communicative translation can be better than the original , since it involves a subjective work re-creation TT Newmark (1991), translation is a process, a skill, a type of com munication by which two messages are transmitted between two different languages . Furthermore, the main purpose of translation studies is to determine appropriate translation methods for a wide range of texts and textual types, providing a set of principle s to translate texts and carrying out translation analyses. Also, the aim of these studies is to go into detail about the meaning process of understanding, interpretation, re - creation, etc. Additionally, there are two approaches suggested by Nida (1964) which are comparable to communicative and semantic translation in which the first one is similar t o Nida's dynamic equivalence, and the second one to Nida's formal equivalence. This is a quite similar theory, but using different names, Nida argues that, when making his torn between two styles of translating that poles: the translation of the \"dynamic equivalence\" (toward the audience and target culture). Just to make a slightly comparison between these two types of equivalence , here is a better explanation 1) Formal correspondence), which is more concerned word -for-word translation and content (faithfulness). 2) Dynamic equivalence, which is focused upon context and sense - for-sense adaptation. Nida (1964) defends the idea that the intention of every translator must be to cause the target text receiver the same effect as produces the original text in the reader. The dynamic equivalence or effect is an adaptation of the text to the new reader so th at it conceives a text translation as natural, not forced, within its linguistic community, for which the translator must overcome linguistic and cultural differences. The translator must definitely search for the most natural and closer equivalent, and tr ansmit the original text effect in the closest way possible to the target text. The Beautiful Truth 12 Jamalimanesh and Rahkhoda ( 2009 ) state d on their online article that Nida (1964, p. 159) indicates that \"a translation of a dynamic equivalence aims at complete naturalness of expression, and tries to relate the receptor to modes of behavior relevant within the context http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). to idea or message expressed in the original text, through some syntactic changes from the SL into the TL; reader's response must be essentially the same to that of the SL reader. As Jamalimanesh and Rahkhoda (20 09) also mentioned that Nida and Taber (1969, p. 200) stated that \"The message of the original text has been so transposed into the rece ptor language that the response of the receptor is essentially like that or the original receptor s\". (Retrieved from http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). The theory of dynamic equivalence emphasizes the importance of other element s of communication that go beyond se form/content , considering and message. For that reason , the translator has to look for a more natural equivalent. It is absolutely essential to transmit the s ame SL message , regardless of the form of the text because the most important aspect within dynamic translation is the content , in which words from the original text are not as important as their meaning. This means that the message must be The Beautiful Truth 13 adapted to the linguistic needs of the TL reader, considering language structures which are familiar to this reader , by making lexical changes according to the cultural references of the TL reader. These grammar adaptations are carried out because the syntactic structur e of the target language differs from that of the source language. For example, when the translator modifies the SL word order, such as substituting a ST verb for a TT noun, among others. These adaptations in the target language and culture provide a trans lation that does not show evident signs of foreign origin, so that a fluid and natural text is produced in the TL. This type of equivalence is suggested a communicative approach within translation and according to his theory it involves \"substituting messages in one language not for separate code -units but for entire messages in some other language\" ( p. 36). This approach is comparable to that of Newmark and Nida previously mentioned, because they focus on transmitting content language, not only by translating but in two different codes\" (p. 114). Moreover, Jakobson states that everything can be translated, either through more complex signs such as This means although it is not always possi ble to find a direct equivalent in the TT, any type of The Beautiful Truth 14 translation can be achieved by using the most appropriate translation resources to interpret meaning from different languages. Therefore, any message can be expressed into any language, since language is an element of communication which is able to overcome differences between two different systems. Thus, the task of the translator is to transfer the content from the source text into the target language by ensuring equivalence. On the other hand, there are some parts of the script where it is strictly necessary to resemble the formal equivalence, and evidently, following the semantic structure the original text as close as possible. Firstly, Newmark (1988) states that semantic translation is a compro mise between free and literal translation , it is applied to expressive texts, and it is distinguished from the true translation simply because it takes into consideration the aesthetic of the original text version . He also says that semantic translation is not the same as literal translation in the sense of or within the linguistic approach , the TT product may be inferior to the original , because there is an inevitable loss of meaning process since the primary concern of using semantic translation i s the original text and not the target culture , it is a translation that is both linguistic . t ranslation is considered as an art ; it is usually done by a single person , and it translation is a method very similar to the true translation. The only thing that differs is that we should The Beautiful Truth 15 pay more attention to the aesthetic value (i.e. a nice and natural tone) of the text in the original language. In a semantic translation, the translator tries to convey the most accurate contextual meaning of the original text, but within of syntactic and since it also follows the structure of the original text as close as possible. For example, if possible, the sentence le ngth of words is kept. This as Newmark (1991), said that Semantic Translation also focuses on the original language, as well as on semantic and syntactic structures, but within the constraints of the target language. Furthermore, as in the formal equivalence, the culture of the original language is pres erved . One difference between these two methods is that in semantic translation the meaning is the most important, while the formal equivalence focuses more on the message. Another feature is that semantic translation is considered inferior to the original text as it always involves the loss of meaning to the aesthetic value of the text in the original language. Tha t means that the translator tries to reproduce the 'flavor' and tone of the original, since the words are 'sacred' (Newmark). Moreover, the translator has no right to improve or correct the original text. Thus the goal of semantic translation is to make an accurate and true from the original language (Newmark, 1991). The Beautiful Truth 16 From those characteristics can be deduced that semantic translation corresponds to literal translation, but not exactly the same. The difference between the two does not occur in the literal translation. When the translation is literal, the translator's primary loyalty is to the rules of the original language, while when the translation is semanti c, the translator's primary loyalty is to the author 1981). equivalence is mainly aimed at preserving the linguistic form of the original mother tongue, trying to imitate it in the word sequence, syntax and, insofar as p ossible, the sonority and the phonology of the target language. The formal equivalence occurs only rarely, since factors such as cultural the formal structural yielding results in a strangeness feeling in the reader's goal which in most cases is used in this type of equivalence. Obviously, the reader expects a product that is not able to recognize as a translation, but as a construct that identifies within the formal structures and idiomatic language. Nida (1964) strong ly suggests that what really matters is to keep the content and believes that sometimes, the translator's effort the original text involves losses in the content of the message. What is important, according to him, is to get tha t the translated text reader reacts the same way as the recipients of the message in their original language do; therefore, the translator must manage how to transfer the semantic value to the communicative reality of the target. The Beautiful Truth 17 Following the ideas of Nid a (1959), the translator must keep the value of the message in both languages in order to achieve the same understanding effect on the original text reader as well as the reader of the translated text. The idea is not trying to convey words, but the semant ic values of message to a different linguistic community. A clear example of the adaptation of to the situation of the recipient linguistic community is the translation of the different images presented in the Bible. This translatio n must be able to maintain the strengthening effect the faith of believers while transmitting images and messages in a way that is close to the realities of all communities. As an expert translator of the Bible, Nida and his concept of mostly dynamic eq uivalence and less use of revolutionized field of translating religious texts. known, any means of and therefore the translation, is subject to the semiotics of law (which involves the tridimensional cts research, results primarily from the lack of equivalence between the source text and the target text). And of course, we cannot leave out the cult ural loss part, which is also an important issue to consider translation, especially when a \"If we insist that the translation should not entail any loss of information, obviously not only translation, but all communication, would be impossible\" (Nida, 1959, p. 13). Additionally, based previous information, we have placed in following table the most general characteristics and differences 18 between to keeping of looking the equivalents in the TT Consists of transmitting the content and mess age from the ST into the TT Faithful to the form of the source language. It is more literal Faithful to the meaning of the source language. It is freer Translating 'sense for sense' Focused on the author and source language Focused on the reader and targ et language The translator cannot make changes or corrections from the ST The be appropriate and the translation does not result so fluent or natural It crea tes a natural, and poetry plays, etc The Beautiful Truth 19 In this table, it is possible to see that both types of translation are two opposi te methods in many ways. As aforementioned, both methods are focused on different aspects, and they produce different translations. For instance, both have very different fe atures, depend important and what the translator is willing to achiev e with his translation from the ST to the TT . The translator can try to be faithful to the original language and its form, or to the meaning and content of the original text according to the situation ; not only depends on the text itself, but also on wheth er the translator wants to taking the TT reader , among others . 1.2. Conceptual Framework In order to develop this research project, there must be terminological clarifications which are necessary for the familiarizat ion and understanding of key concepts along this manuscript. All these terms are basically used in this specific type of research whose contents of its physical appearance or the scenic views that may be enjoyed The Beautiful Truth 20 from the property; the artistic worth of something, rather than its practical value\". (TheFreeDictionary.com, 2013). This definition is a g eneral overview of Aesthetic Value; however, it can . 1.2.2. might present\". For the purpose of this study, this is the definition that best describes this term applied to give a linguistic analysis of the use of a specific word or phrase accord ing to the context of the original document in which it is fundamental to follow the process of carrying out the adoption of individual words or even of large sets of vocabulary items from another lan guage ( from French), macho (from Spanish), yen 'craving' (from Chinese), or schwa (from Hebrew via German in English) . (p. 241 ) This definition and the examples best illustrate the whole purp ose of borrowing in the Translation field which indicates that a word can be taken from another language and used in the intended language without translating The Beautiful Truth 21 it, being one of the simplest of all translation techniques. For instance, to Munday and Hatim (2004) A calque is a special kind of borrowing whereby a language borrows an expression form of translates each elements. The result is lexical calque, as the i.e. a which respects the syntactic structure of the TL, whilst introducing a new mode of expression; or ii. a structural calque, as in the second exa mple, below, which introduces a new construction into Linguistics refers to : The approach to the study of language that began to emerge in the 1970s. We see three major hypothesis as guiding the cognitive ling faculty, grammar is conceptualization, and knowledge of language emerges from l anguage use . (p. 1). In brief, this discipline studies Collocations According to Nesselhauf (2004) : In one of these two views, a collocation is considered the co - occurrence of words at a certain distance, and a distinctio n is usually made between co -occurrences that are frequent (or more precisely, be expected if words combined randomly in a language) and those that are not . (p. 11-12) This is the description that best defines this term used in the intention of our research paper since it absolutely offers the explanation of when two or more words are used together in the proper grammatical structure in order to transfer the accurate message from one language to another in the Translation field. 1.2.7. Condensation \"Whereby a source element or construction corresponds to a tighter or compact target counterpart\" (Malone, 1998, p.59). This is a translation technique that produces a more economic text in the TT (Malone, 1998). It is similar to Red uction which is described within the translation techniques which are in , \"Corpus Linguistics is the study of language data on a large scale - the computer -aided analy sis of transcribed utterances general, a corpus linguistically speaking relates to a large collection of texts The Beautiful Truth 23 which can be written or spoken materials that which procedures equivalent texts\" (p.150). This is the opposite of literal is carried out to translate idioms, metaphors, proverbs, among other figures speech in it is absolutely essential to transmit the same content and meaning of the message into the TT by changing the structure of the ST. 1.2.10. Figures of S peech According to Myers (2009) : Figures of speech focus upon literary devices or techniques to spice up and invigorate prose and poetry. and alliteration which will introduce new vocabulary as part of the creative learning. (p. 4). The figures of speech are often applied in literary work s, and the authors use them in order to enrich the lexicon of a language . 1.2.11. Lacuna (Lexical Gap) A point within a system of sense relations at which a word might be expected but none exists. Thus in the system of words for a person's relations pare nt and child subsume both father and son (male) and mother and daughter (female); from this an analysis of the system might predict a similar term subsuming The Beautiful Truth 24 e.g. uncle and aunt. Then, since there is none, it might be described as having a gap at that point . (Matthews, 2007). So that the best way to solve the problem of lexical gaps in languages Linguistics is usual ly defined at the science of language or, alternatively, as the scientific study of language \" (p. 37). Lyons also stated: Linguistics, as has been emphasized before, has natural link with a wide range of academic disciplines. To say that linguistics is a s cience is not to deny that, by virtue of . (p. 45 -46). For the purpose of our study the above citations best de fine this term since they des specific of this study, from stating that it is a science . Linguistics not only involves theory, but also includes scientific and detailed observations about language. 1.2.13. Literal translation According to Salem, and Almuntashri ): Literal also everyday usage as direct translation, denotes the rendering of text from one language to another (Latin: \"verbum pro verbo\" However, in translation studies, literal translation denotes technical translation of The Beautiful Truth 25 scientific, or legal texts. http://fr.slideshare.net/studentsandteachers/types -of- translation ). This is an accurate definition within the Translation field in which there is a brief comparison in order to explain that 'sense' is not taking into account when applying literal translation. Besides, t his type of translation that follows the form of the source language is carried to Mos (2010) , Complex Lexical Items can be defined as : Complex lexical items are strings of language in which more than one meaning -carrying element can be recognized yet which are very likely candidates to understood difficult, but only as an containing internal structure . (p. 24). This definition understanding of what this term involves. It is commonly u sed in Translation, and it is clear that languages are made up of these items which are either single words or phrases that helps us as a word, sentence, letter, etc.)\". (p.1). T his concept is The Beautiful Truth 26 the one that best illustrates the meaning of what a meta -language has to do with Linguistics and since our project is totally focused on Translation with all its methods, techniques, issues and everything find an adequate way of treating the comprehension and production of language. It is quite another to succeed in adopting a reflexive attitude with regard to language objects and their manipulation\" . (p.1). This concept is the one which best fits in our project since it is totally concerned with the linguistic side; in fact, it is described in both a general and a more specific point of view so we can learn it from different perspectives. 1.2.17. Na turalization \"Naturalization succeeds transference where the source language word is adapted first to the normal pronunciation, then to the normal phonological and morphological form translation process because a good piece of translation has to transmit the same message from the original source in a natural and fluent way into the target text. The Beautiful Truth 27 1.2.18. Neologism According to Levchenko (2010) or phrase created for defining a new (unknown before) object or expressing a new notion \". (p. 11 -12). The creation of neologisms has to do with social and cultural changes, and al so with the scientific and technological development, and they can be derived from a foreign language but the intended audience has to incorporate it in its vocabulary being sub sounds of concerned the function, behavior, and organization of sounds as LINGUSITIC items \". (p. 1) . In the linguistic field, it focuses on the way how sounds work in a specific language or languages in general, and how these sounds are organized, the interactio n with each other, is concerned study of meaning as communicated by a speaker (or writer) and interpreted by a listener (or reader). It has, consequently, more to do with the analys is of what people mean by their utterances than 28 This means that it focuses on analyzing how produce and context that of a culture typically associates with a situation type. It is the meaning potential that in Based given, register is the set of contextual and sociolinguistic variables that determine how language is used in a particular context . This is an appropriate defin ition Rendering is \"a translation of a book or piece of writing into a different language or a different style\". Example: \"A new rendering of the Bible into modern English\". This term has some other different meanings; nevertheless, the definition aforementioned is the most accurate one within this field of study, in which the translated text is the final pr in Oxford Dictionaries Online, script is \"the written text of a play, film, or broadcast\". This is a common term used not The Beautiful Truth 29 only in the field of translation, but also in ot her fields of study; however, we think it is important to mention it because there is a script i ntended to be translated for this project, and many other professional translators around the world carry out the translation of t hese kind s of work. (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com ). used to refer to the study of meaning, and, since meaning is a part of language, sema ntics is a part of linguistics\" (p.1). S emantics is absolutely essential to the study of language acquisition , which is the cognitive process by which acquire the capacity to understand language and of words and sentences. 1.2.25. Semiotics According to T he University of Vermont (2013), \"Semiotics, or Semiology is the study of signs, symbols, and signification. It is the study of how meaning is created, not what it is.\" (para. 1). This discipline focuses on the communication systems within society, and also on the interpretatio n and production of sounds. Retrieved from (http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/semiotics_and_ads/terminology.html ). The Beautiful Truth 30 1.2.26. respect to Sonority, Roach (2009) mentions the following : It is possible to describe sounds in terms of how powerful they sound to the listener; a vowel sound such as a is said to be more sonorant than the fricative f, for example. It is said that if we hear a word such as 'banana' as consisting of three syllables, it is because we can hear three peaks of so nority correspo nding to the vowels. (p. 79). This information agrees with our linguistic reasons in order to express what the main idea of our research paper carries out giving us the opportunity to use it in the Translation field accordingly. 1.2.27. Sou rce Text & Target Text In accordance with Synonyms & Antonyms (2013) , Source T ext is \"the original text from which a translation is done into another language , often abbreviated as ST\". This definitio n is by professionals in the Translation field who perfectly know that the source text is the one intended to be translated into any other language. On the other hand, Target T ext is \"the finished product of a translated text, often abbreviated as TT\", so this term and its definition represents the message that goes from the original text to the intended audience . (http:/ /www.synonyms.net/antonyms/). to Dictionary.com , Source Language is \"the language in which a text appears that is to be t ranslated into another language\"; and Target Language is \" the language into which a text is to be t ranslated from another language\". ( http://dictionary.refere nce.com/ ). In the Translation field, The Beautiful Truth 31 Source Language is abbreviated as SL and Target Language as TL. As well as the terms mentioned above, this termino logy is frequently used in th e Translation field, and it is necessary to know about them in order to make a distinction between both languages. 1.2.29. Syntax out together\". Traditionally it refer s to the branch of grammar dealing with the ways in which words, with or without appropriate inflections, are arranged to (Matthews , 1982:1) . (p. 1). For this project, there must be an analysis of sentence struct ure, and as well as semantics, S yntax plays a fundamental role any means always, it is rendering the meaning of a text into another language in the way that the author intended the text. Common sense tells us that this ought to be simple, as one ought to be able to say something as well in one language as in another. On the other hand, you may see it as complicated, artificial and fraudulent, since by using another language you are pretending to be someone you are not. Hence in many types of text (legal, administrative, dia lect, local, cultural) the temptation is to transfer as many SL (Source Language) words to the T L (Target Language) as possible . (p. 5). For this study, this definition provides an easy understanding of what this field involves. Besides, Translation has be come a fundamental tool to The Beautiful Truth 32 transmit a message from the source to the target language, from one culture to another, improving the communi II 2. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK 2. 1. Translation Techniques There ar e many translation techniques that can be applied on the process to transmit the information from the source into the target language and have an accurate final product ; the main a etalinguistic one (e.g. a new technical process, and unknown concept, B orrowing is the simplest of all translation methods. For instance, in order to introduce the flavor of the SL culture into a translation, foreing terms may be used, 'datchas', and 'apparatchik', 'dollars', 'party' English, Mexican Spanish food names 'tequila' and 'tortillas', and so on. (Munday & Hatim, 2004, p. 14 9) So that B orrowing is the taking of words from any language without translation. Many English words are borrowed into other languages, and there are some examples from our project: The radio show 'The Power Hour' is borrowed from the ST into the TT. Tecnolog\u00eda Terminator, in which the word 'Terminator' is borrowed from the ST into the TT. On the other hand , Calque is a special kind of borrowing whereby a language borrows an expression form the syntactic structure of the TL, whilst introducing a new mode of expression; or a The Beautiful Truth 34 structural calque, which introduce a new construction into the language . (Munday & Hatim, 2004, p. 1 49) Here is an example of an express ion that was originated by the literal translation of two terms without following Spanish grammar rules and became part of Spanish la nguage, and it is considered a calque from English: English -Spanish Calque: Science -fiction - Ciencia ficci\u00f3n There is another technique called Literal T ranslation. According to Munday and Hatim (2004), it is \"the direct transfer of a SL text into a grammatically and idiomatically appropriate TL text in which the translators' task is li mited to observing the adherence to the linguistic servitudes of the TL\" (p. 149). For example: English: solution for cancer, diabetes, arthritis and other diseases Spanish: La soluci\u00f3n para el c\u00e1ncer, diabetes, artritis y otras enfermedades In addi tion, there is another techni que called that \"involves replacing one word class with another without changing the meaning of the message. Beside s being a special translation procedure, T ransposition can and confusing. The Beautiful Truth 35 TT: Esto fue inquietante y con fuso para Garrett. ST: Chemically -dependent fields TT: technique: Modulation is a variation of the form of the message, obtained by a change in the point of view. This change can be justified when, although a literal, or even transposed, translation results did have the vaccines. TT: S\u00ed fui vacunada. ST: You can choose not to smoke TT: La gente puede optar por no fumar On the other hand, a ccording to Munday and Hatim (2004) procedures equivalent texts\" For example: ST: Science is when you can put numbers to things . TT: Hacer ciencia significa analizar las cosas usando n\u00fameros . ST: W ho carries the torch of a way of life that is health care . TT: Defendiendo un estilo de vida que es el cuidado de la salud. The Beautiful Truth 36 At last , and again according to Jamalimanes this last technique: Adaptation is the extreme limit of translation. It is used in those cases where the type of situation being referred to by the SL message is unknown in the TL culture. In such cases translators have to create new situation can considered as being equivalent. Adaptation can, therefore, be described as a special equivalence, a situational equivalence. They are particularly frequent in book and film titles . (http://www.translationdirectory.com/articles/article2025.php ). There not examples of this in our project, because this movie is a documentary in which this type of technique has not been applied. But there are other examples from other sources: A famous movie: '(500) Days of Summer' in U.S. , '(500) d\u00edas juntos' in Spain and ' (500) d\u00edas con ella' in Hispanic America 'The tooth fairy ' in U.S, and 'El Rat\u00f3n de los Dientes ' or 'Rat\u00f3n P\u00e9rez ' in Spanish speaking countries. In addition to the translation techniques listed above, there are some other similar procedures which are an American model, such as Matching that covers two specific processes called Equation and Substitution. The first one refers to some form of direct equivalence, which means that is the same as literal translation previously mentioned . Equation is \"when an element of the source text is rendered by a target text element deemed the most straightforward counterpart available; schematically, or more simply\" (Malone, 1988, p. 19). On the other hand, substitution is \"when a source text element is rendered by a target element deemed as being other than the The Beautiful Truth 37 most straightforward counte rpart available\" (Malone, 1988, This substitution is when certain terms from some expressions of the ST have to be substituted for most suitable ones into the TT in order to transmit a better cultural meaning and connotations according t o the target reader. There is also another technique called Zigzagging that covers Divergence and Convergence. Divergence, \"whereby an element of the source text may be mapped onto any of two or more alternatives in the target text, is a translational nexu s reflecting relative paradigmatic richness of the target resources compared with the source\" (Malone, 1988, p. 29). In this case, this technique leads to the concept of one -to-many different lexical from point where they're going and letters. TT: levantarse , salir y volv erse activistas; est\u00e1n protestando en las calles y escribiendo cartas . In this example, the term 'demostrating' from the ST is diverged orrect meaning and use of the range of alternatives to avoid ambiguity and other problems. The Beautiful Truth 38 On the other hand, Convergence \"as the mirror image to Divergence, at times provides a moment of respite to the translator since a paradigmatic opposition in the so urce language has no direct counterpart in the target language\" (Malone, 1988, p. 36). This is the opposite of divergence, where varied source -language terms collapse into just one in the target language, rendering a range of alternatives with a single lex ical item, for ST: He refused to be . TT: El no acept\u00f3 remuneraci\u00f3n alguna . In this example the phrasal verb 'to be paid off ' from the ST is converged into ' remuneraci\u00f3n ' in the TT. Furthermore, Recrescence, which is \"Amplification signifiers to cover syntactic or lexical gaps\" (Molina & Hurtado, 2002, p. 4. Retrieved from http://www.erudit.org/revue/meta/2002/v47/n4/008033ar.pdf ). It is the addition of some to the ST to facilitate the TT reader's comprehension. It is carried out when certain items or components of the ST are not clear enough into the TT. For instance: English: Gulf War veterans Spanish: Veteranos de Guerra G olfo In this e xample, \"Gulf War veterans\" in the ST was amplified as \"Veteranos de la Guerra del Golfo\" into the TT due to the difference in the grammatical structure in both languages so it is suitable to the TT . The Beautiful Truth 39 On the other hand, \"Reduction as the inverse of Amplific ation, trajection.\" ( Malone, 1988, p. 46). This means that it is the omission of one or more elements in the target text considered unn ecessary and redundant. For example: English : What seemed like a simple snack \"taken for granted\" in the garden had tremendous implications worldwide. Spanish: Lo que parec\u00eda un simple refrigerio \"extra\u00eddo\" del huerto, tendr\u00eda tremendas implicaciones a ni vel mundial. In this example, the expression \"taken for granted\" has been reduced and just being used a , there is one final and absolutely essential step for a translation to be complete, which is editing. There are two kinds of editing: basic translated Stylistic E diting , on the other hand, \"presupposes a text that is reasonable finished in such respect as literal meaning, grammar and spelling. It is purely a process with Truth into the connotative the TT alone\" (S\u00e1ndor et al. , 1995, p. 169). Finally, there are many useful tools on internet that he lp translators work faster, such as large varieties of online translators, Management Software) , dictionaries that can vary according to the different fields of study: medicine, nutrition, among others. One of the most famous and used onli ne translator machi nes around the world is Google T ranslate , which is a good option to translate vast amounts of information, and it has improved in accuracy over the last few years. Moreover, there are different kinds of dictionaries and encyclopedias; th e most wordreference.com, among to carry out some medical translations , there are many available resources on the Internet with specialized terminology that contains medical, nutrition and health terms. There is a wide range of dictionaries in terms. \"Some of the most useful basic medical information may, for instance be found at sites such as BioMedSearch, Free Medical Dictionary, Dorland's Medical Dictionary (Illustrated), the eMedicine Medical Dictionary, Stedman's Medical Dictionary or MT Desk\" . (Indian Scripts , n.d., para. 2) . The Truth 41 2. 2. Annotations 2.2.1. About the Linguistic Field of Study The text studied in this research project has a medical scope in the nutrition and health field. It is a script of a documentary movie that was written and directed by Steve Kroschel, it is from Gerson Institute. The linguistic field tends to be general, the re are lots of study fields within languages, but for this project we are going to focus on the medical field with specific terminology that will be used and analyzed during the translation process. 2.2.2. About the Form of the Text The information intend ed to be translated is a documentary movie in which the text is a script about nutritional issues. There are dialogues divided into sentences with time codes. This text contains scientific, descriptive and persuasive information about the Gerson Therapy, t he -based cure for cancer. 2.2.3. About the Contextual Features the Text Here is the familiarization process, the vocabulary within the text is made up with medical, nutrition and health terms, and some other words that can be found in other relate d texts, but we have translating them according to the context. Examples: - Retort: crematorio - Roller coaster: altibajos The Beautiful Truth 42 - Blood pressure: presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea , etc. 2.3. ANALYSIS OF LINGUISTIC ANNOTATIONS FROM THE TRANSLATED MOVIE SCRIPT 2.3.1. Metaphors Problems \"The main and one serious purpose of metaphor to describe an entity, event or quality more comprehensively and concisely in a more complex way than is possible by using literal language. \" (Newmark, 1988, p. 84). Furthermore, metaphoric languag e is a common characteristic of literary oriented texts. In our source there are some analogies that correspond to this category, which will be described herei n: 1. As we can see in the table below, in lines 1 and 2, the source offers a philosophical view of how human beings approach life and its interpretation, how it is perceived as light. We have rendered a communicative transfer since linguistic equation needs to be achieved in order to get to the target audience; i.e. Spanish speaking addressees with different socio -cultural background. opted for a more culture -bound approach to transmit the original message in a natural and easier way to be understood by the intended audience. Source Text (ST) 1 The infinite depths of darkness 2 be sliced open by light. Target Text (TT) 1 La m\u00e1s densa oscuridad puede ser 2 traspasada por penetrantes rayos de luz. 2. In lines 3, 4 and 5, we can notice that the philosophical point of view continues since \"life\" is interpreted as a \"miracle\" and with only \"one deli cate The Beautiful Truth 43 vessel\" is enough to keep going throughout expanses\". Here, we some linguistic equation needed to be achieved in order to get to the target audience; however, we have also applied some of t he semantic translation since there are terms like \"vessel\" that has several different meanings tried to find the most accura te and consistent translation so the target language can take it just as the original message meant. Besides, we used Reordering as one academic and necessary to use this specific technique since the target script is intended for a Spanish -speaking community, and there are some linguistic and grammatical order differences between these two languages, i.e. in how the sentences are structured accordlingly. That is the case of the phras e \"miracle called 'life'\" which was moved to the end of the sentence in order to provide the exact meaning given by the original message. Besides, we can notice that the ST is differently structured from the TT. Source Text (ST) 3 And for the finite exp anses of the 4 miracle called \"life,\" it has but one 5 delicate vessel. Target Text (TT) 3 Y a trav\u00e9s de una delicada arteria, se 4 dan paso las finitas extensiones del 5 milagro llamado \"vida\" . 3. Continuing with this analysis, in the following case, w e can tell that in line 8, the phrase \"walking around\" used alone could have many options if translated into the Target Language, such as: \"dando una vuelta, paseando\", etc. However, within the context, we had to convey the same meaning The Beautiful Truth 44 coming from the ori ginal text by going deeper in the analysis and using a figurative form in order to obtain the most accurate rendering possible. As we can see in the example below, if we follow the context of the original language, we can observe that \"walking around\" in t his case means \"andan por ah\u00ed\", but the translation just like is still missing something there, so that the message gets completed from the Source to the TL. Therefore, we went even deeper and used Amplification as another translation technique, we added \" tan tranquilos\" in order to get the same effect in the intended audience as the original one generates. Practically, the whole sentence has been reordered, so the order of lines 3, 4 and 5 does not coincide from one language to the other. However, if Reord ering Technique was not have been almost impossible to express the intended message to the TT. Source Text (ST) 6 Yet that seemed absurd when 7 considering that many people are 8 walking around with amalgams 9 in their mouths. Target Text (TT) 6 Sin embargo, parece absurdo si se 7 considera que muchas personas 8 andan por ah\u00ed tan tranquilos con amalgamas 9 en sus bocas. 4. In line 13, the source text offers a figurative view of \"genetically engineered foods\", that ac cording to the author's point of view this kind of food has a negative effect in people's life, and for this expression to be rendered into the target language has to be adapted for the target audience to understand the implicit meaning of this idea. Since this metaphor \"genie is out of the bottle\" has a figurative sense in which the author is trying to state that \"engineer ed food\" is too good to be true , which means that is apparently The Beautiful Truth 45 good and inoffensive , but it could be dangerous if people ingest it. Therefore, \"Caja de Pandora\" is the best rendering in this case because it refers to something that could carry some negative consequences. In order to fulfill the expectations of the target audience, this is the most suitable translation: Source Text 10 O ne of the greatest misconceptions 11 we have about genetically 12 engineered foods is that 13 genie is out of the bottle . Target Text 10 Una de las creencias m\u00e1s err\u00f3neas 11 que tenemos sobre los alimentos 12 transg\u00e9nicos es que son como 13 una caja de pandora. 5. In lines 17 and 18, the expression \"roller coaster\" is used in a symbolic sense, and according to the source text this phrase means that the person involved in this matter is experiencing mixed emotions, such as ups and downs. This metaphor i s commonly used in English in an informal and idiomatic sense when referring to this kind of feelings, and regarding the context the best translation in Spanish would be \"altibajos\", so that here we in order suitable equivalent the context is: Source Text 14 been here, inside myse lf 15 feel hugely different: much stronger, 16 physically, and I've lost the nausea. 17 I've had, uh - it's a little bit of a 18 roller coaster . Target Text 14 Desde que estoy aqu\u00ed, me siento muy 15 diferente por dentro, mucho m\u00e1s 16 fuert e f\u00edsicamente, y ya no tengo 17 nauseas. He tenido algunos 18 altibajos. The Beautiful Truth 46 6. In line 20, the source offers a figurative view of people's lifestyle within this expression, and it may cause a translation problem since there is not a specific equivalent for this expression in the target language , and for this reason it is more difficult to carry out a m etaphorical translation from the source to the target text. In addition, \" what side of the tracks you lived at the end\" has a figurative meaning that denotes t he way people live, and according to this, the rendering from the ST into the TT is the following: Source Text 19 It won't matter where you came from, or on 20 what side of the tracks you lived at the end . Target Text 19 Al fina l, no importar\u00e1 de don de viniste, 20 o la forma en que viviste . 7. In line 24, the expression \" the torch of a way of life\" is expressed through figurative language, where they are referring to a way of life from a person who is leading a particular lifestyle which is health ca re according to the source text, and the author has used this particular metaphor that is an eye-catching expression which causes a positive impact on the reader, and at the same time, it highlights the fact that the woman keeps a clear position. The most suitable rendering is: Source Text 21 How could he possibly forget a woman 22 who carries on her father's work 23 relentlessly, against all opposition, 24 who carries the torch of a way of life 25 that is health care . Target Text 21\u00bfC\u00f3mo podr\u00eda Garrett olvidar a una mujer 22 que incansablemente contin\u00faa con el 23 trabajo de su padre, contra toda 24 oposici\u00f3n , defendiendo un estilo de vida 25 que es el cuidado de la salud. 8. In lines 26 and 27, this figurative expression mentioned by the author of the text is an understandable expression at first sight for anyone The Beautiful Truth 47 who has knowledge of both languages: English and Spanish, however, it is important to consider certain things when translating it, for instance, there are some lexical items that have to be re ndered equivalently for the target audience to get an accurate meaning of this idea, so that in order to transmit the same metaphorical sense accurately from the ST into the TT the verb \"act\u00fae\" was the best option within this sentence. Therefore, here is t he proposed translation: Source Text 26 My words of advice to you, b ring the 27 power of plants into your body. Target Text 26 Mi consejo es: deja que el poder de las 27 plantas act\u00fae en tu cue rpo. 2.3.2. Linguistic Translation Problems Linguistic T ranslation Problems occur differences between the source (original) and target languages. In some languages, one word can have different meanings (i.e. there is ambiguity), and the translator needs to be careful to choose exact is a ppropriate the There be by existence of idioms and collocations. A linguistic translation error is any type of grammatical error in language structure. 9. In the next case, firstly, there is a Linguistic Translation issue since in English, a general statement is grammatically structured in plural, while the Spanish structure is in singular. As we can note, in line 28 of the ST, the term \"sensitivities\" is written i n plural, and when it is conveyed to the TT, it is written in singular \"una aguda sensibilidad\". If the translator does not have the knowledge of this type of translation technique may not be able to make The Beautiful Truth 48 that difference and the TT will not be as accurate as it should be. There is also some type of differences in the two languages when it comes to determine the real meaning of the original text since English is a more direct and practical language compared to Spanish that is less practical and less direct, reason for which, sometimes it needs more explanation in order to deliver the desired meaning: Source Text (ST) 28 For Garrett, his sensitivities about 29 nature are acute. Target Text (TT) 28 Garrett posee una aguda sensibilidad 29 hacia la naturaleza . 10. Proceeding with the next example, we can observe that there is an issue with the order of whole sentence since we had to change it completely with the purpose of offering a better possibility to communicate the same meaning coming from the mother la nguage. In lines 30 and 31, we could have chosen the more traditional way of translating this message: \"Even a 15-year-old could find the text a good read\" as \"Incluso un chico de 15 a\u00f1os podr\u00eda encontrar una buena lectura en el texto\". However, if it have been done that way, the message would have not been transmitted faithfully to the intended audience. Therefore, we had to go further in the translation and use the techniques learned previously, in this specific case, we applied Reordering which make it m ore natural and closer to the ST: \" El texto ser\u00eda buena lectura , incluso para un chico de 15 a\u00f1os\". If we read the original version, we could tell that the intentional message is to emphasize the fact that \"even a 15 -year-old boy could find the text inter esting\", which means that the main part is that the boy is pretty young but he still may find the text The Beautiful Truth 49 interesting due to its importance, and if the sentence is reordered when translated in the TT, we consider that the real intention of the ST is achieved. Source Text (ST) 30 Even a 15 -year-old could find 31 the text a good read. Target Text (TT) 30 El texto ser\u00eda buena lectura , 31 incluso para un chico de 15 a\u00f1os. 11. The next illustration shows how a translation can be done from one language to anot her using Reordering as well but taking the last phrase \"to start with\" in line 35 in the ST, and placing it in the middle of the sentence in the TT as shown in lines 33 and 34. This issue is very common in these type of situations since in English, the gr ammatical order of the sentence is presented just as it is in the ST, but if we want to do the same way when translating into Spanish, the message could be somehow confusing for TT audience. Translators rendering any text, they should pay very close attention to every single detail to facilitate the reception of the original version of the message. Source Text (ST) 32 The boy wasn't sure how that would 33 be accomplished, but he did draw out 34 an analogy between gold mini ng and 35 human nature, to start with. Target Text (TT) 32 El chico no estaba seguro de c\u00f3mo 33 lograr eso , pero para empezar dedujo 34 una analog\u00eda entre las minas de oro y 35 la naturaleza humana. 12. As shown in lines 36, 37 and 38, we also applied the very common technique, Reordering, since it is convenient in this specific case too. If we used the same order in the TT as presented in the ST, the results would have not being as expressed originally, and the Beautiful Truth not be able to prove that he is knowledgeable enough to render any kind of translation. In this example, the last phrase \"would seem absurd\" in the ST was moved to the very beginning in the TT in order to provide the same effect transmitted in the ST to the intended audience. Source Text (ST) 36 For the American Dental Association to 37 continue to insist that amalgams are 38 safe would seem absurd. Target Text (TT) 36 Ser\u00eda absurdo que la Asociaci\u00f3n 37 Dental Americana contin\u00fae i nsistiendo 38 que las amalgamas son saludables . 13. In the subsequent case in point, we can notice that we applied Reordering, in lines 41 and 42 of the ST compared with lines 41 and 42 of the TT, we are able to di stinguish the order of the phrases \"mercury vapor\" in line 41 of the ST while in the TT is located in line 42. The same thing, but backwards, happens with the phrase \"Dr. Roger Eichman\". Also, in the ST (line 42), the term \"gave\" is the last word of the sentence; however, in the TT, it was moved to a different position (see line 41). In addition to that, the second half of the sentence was changed from Passive Voice (in English) to Active Voice (in Spanish) due to linguistic differences of these tw languages. Amplification is another technique applied in this example, as we see in line 41 in the ST, the phrase \" methlyl mercury vapor\" is rendered as \"vapores met\u00edlicos de mercurio\" in line 42 in the TT; and of course, we should not forget this phrase \"mercury vapor\" represents in English (singular) and when it is translated into Spanish, it is translated as \"vapores (plural) de mercurio\". The Beautiful Truth 51 Source Text (ST) 39 He couldn't seem to the 40 disturbing chemistry lesson about methyl mercury vapor that 42 Dr. Roger Eichman gave. Target Text (TT) 39 \u00c9l parec\u00eda no poder superar una 40 perturbadora clase de qu\u00edmica 41 del Dr. Roger Eichman sobre 42 los mortales vapores met\u00edlicos de mercurio. 14. In lines 43 and 44, in the expression \"shoveling out of barrels\" the term \"shoveling\" is used as a verb in the SL, and this verb does not exist in the TL, so that here we have a linguistic problem that has to be solved by changing the SL verb into another part of s peech, such as a noun in this case: \" palas \", which is the most appropriate according to the previous context of the ST, where a women is talking about what she used to do in her job. Besides, there are some other parts of speech, such us: within t he sentence orde r to convey the whole idea, and naturalizing the ST sentence into the TT. Therefore, Source Text 43 I was basically shoveling aspartame 44 out of barrels Target Text 43 B\u00e1sicamente yo sacaba el aspartame 44 de los barriles con palas . 15. In lines 45 and 46, this sentence goes after the expression mentioned above and both are related to each other, in which \"by the shovels\", from a linguis tic point of view, is structurally changed with different parts of speech , and it as \". This expression is render Spanish \"palas\", within the context it refers to a great amou nt of a chemical substance , and the following translation shows the most accurate equivalence : The Beautiful Truth 52 Source Text 45 And you were using it by the shovels, 46 weren't you? Target Text 45 Y lo utilizabas en grandes cantidades, 46 \u00bfverdad ? 16. In lines 47 and 4 8, this expression has been rendered according to some explanations that were given in the previous context of the text in which they are discussing about some \"tabs\", and in order to be more explicit and naturalize the sentence into Spanish, we have used by the words \"t iritas \" to explain about what exactly they are referring to, so that the target audience can perfectly understand the message. As a result, the translation we have used is: Source Text 47 Yes, um, the qui ck dissolve, 48 like the Listerine ? Target Text 47 S\u00ed, bueno, las tiritas de disoluci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida, 48 como las l\u00e1minas Listerine ? 17. In lines 49 and 50 , the structure of the ST is different from that of the TL, therefore, it has to be syntactically and semantically adapted into using the appropriate sense. Moreover, some Reduction used, in which some implicit content from the ST is transmitted into an explicit message into the TT by eliminating some terms from the original text and even changing the grammatical structure from passive to active voice into the TT ; for example in English is shown as \"Now became injured as a result of using MSG\" , while in Spanish is shown as \" Ella se lastim\u00f3 por usar GMS\". It has been rendered into the most appropriate structure of the TL in order to make it easier for the intended audience : The Beautiful Truth 53 Source Text 49 Now she became injured as a result 50 of using MSG, but she didn't really 51 use it; it was done to her. Target Text 49 Ella se lastim\u00f3 por usar GMS, 50 aunque en realidad no lo usaba, s e lo 51 causaron a ella . 2.3.3. Text-specific Translation Problems Text-specific translation problems are specific to a particular text or to the particular way an author expresses him/h erself or understand typical problems when translating a movie, tha t is when translators use only the script without watching the movie at the same time. Like in the case below, in line 52 in the ST \"a simple snack\" refers to a \"carrot\" that Garret (the boy) got from the garden, cleans it with his T -shirt and eats it. And since that part of the movie was showing how a piece of vegetable (in this case, a carrot) could make a difference in the health of a human being to the point to cause \" tremendous implications worldwide\" as it says the TT in line 54. Of course, it was st ill translated into Spanish as \"simple refrigerio\" as shown in line 52 in the TT, but, in order to understand the real meaning of it, we had to watch the movie. Source Text (ST) 52 What seemed like a simple snack 53 taken for granted in the garden had 54 tremendous implications worldwide. Target Text (TT) 52 Lo que parec\u00eda un simple refrigerio 53 extra\u00eddo del huerto, tendr\u00eda 54 tremendas implicaciones a nivel mundial. 19. Here is another case of a movie translation issue, and it is about this particul ar phrase \"such as this porcupine\" in line 57 in the ST, translated The Beautiful Truth 54 as \"como es el caso de este puercoesp\u00edn\" in the TT. The problem here is that the \"porcupine\" that the script referred to was not mentioned previously at all, and in the script said \"such a s this porcupine\", but without watching the movie, it was quite difficult to know which \"porcupine\" the script was talking about. The movie shows a baby \"porcupine\" as the young creature as it is explained in line 56 of both texts (ST and TT). Translators should be aware that a movie translation carries out more details as it does a traditional translation. Translators must watch the movie at the same time they read the script of it because the combination of both will make such a great difference when rend ering any of these particular type of movie translations. Source Text (ST) 55 He understood how important it is to 56 feed a young creature, such as this 57 porcupine, the right mix of foods, or 58 that creature would succumb quickly, 59 especially in it s first few days of life. Target Text (TT) 55 \u00c9l entendi\u00f3 cu\u00e1n importante es alimentar 56 a un cachorro , como es el caso de este 57 puercoesp\u00edn, con la mezcla exacta de 58 alimentos, o esa criatura morir\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente , 59 sobre todo en sus primeros d\u00edas de vida. 20. In lines 61 and 62 the expression \"obesity and oversized people\" represents some Spanish according to our register, which refers to a particular social setting and the way we say things. In the Spanish -communit y, for instance in Ecuador, it is kind of rude to say \"una persona obesa\", using such informal language. That is why in oral and written communication people from here tend to use more appropriate terms to say this kind of expressions in order to avoid rud eness and negative terms may involve things. There is also Deletion or Reduction in the last part of the sentence in which the word \"deeper\" was deleted because it was redundant within the The Beautiful Truth 55 context and we do not use that word in Spanish to refer to an oversized person, so it was not necessary to render it into the TT. According to this analysis the most suitable translation would be: Source Text 60 One of the issues we have with 61 oversized, uh - obesity and oversized 62 people is that they're very wide, and 63 they're also very much thicker, or deeper. Target Text 60 Uno de los problemas que tenemos 61 con las personas que sufren de 62 sobrepeso , es que son muy anchas, y 63 tambi\u00e9n mucho m \u00e1s gruesas. 2.3.4. Pragmatic translation problems any issues relating to time, place and context. The best way illustrate pragmatic problems anization vary from one culture (e.g. American vs. British Ministries)\". -with-translation - problems/ a problem since \"skeletons \" can be misinterpreted or mistranslated from the ST into the TT as \"esqueleto\" which is the first rendering that comes into mind; however, we had to go further and deeper in the translation techniques and found the most accurate representation of it withi n the context in order offer a more appropriate rendering to convey the exact meaning coming from the ST. In line 65 of both texts, we are able to see how \"skeletons\" have as easily and it would definitely facilitate the translation of the original message to the intended audience. The Beautiful Truth 56 Source Text (ST) 64 He dug for more information, and then 65 more skeletons were uncovered. Target Text (TT) 64 Busc\u00f3 m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n, y as\u00ed 65 aparecieron m\u00e1s irregularidades. 22. In the next situation, we have applied another quite common technique, i.e. Amplification, which allows us translators to go further into the translation and discover a better option of rendering, that is the case of line 67 in the ST where it says \"fluoride is still debated\". In order to convey the same meaning, we needed to add some extra words to be faithful to the context we would not have bee n able to express the message as accurate as it shows in line 67 of the TT \"fluoruro sigue en discusi\u00f3n\". The only way to do it was using this convenient technique since there are pragmatic translation differences between English and Spanish. These two lan guages could be semantically compatible if we as translators apply techniques that help us to find a good solution for any kind of problems that we may encounter in the whole translation process. Therefore, translators should be well prepared possibilities and the different techniques that are available online or in textbooks. Source Text (ST) 66 And yet in present day, the subject of 67 fluoride is still debated. Target Text (TT) 66 Incluso en la actualidad , el tema de l 67 fluoruro sigue en discusi\u00f3n. 23. The next case shows an issue that is very common when translating a dialogue or, as in this example, a movie script from English to Spanish. That is when in English the gender has to be specified by adding The Beautiful Truth 57 the word \"male\" or \"female\" in most cases to avoid confusion. In Spanish, it is specified when mentioning the noun, as in this example \"presentador\"; it is already telling us that the person is a \"male\". For the solution of this rendering problem we have applied a technique called redundant it \"Presentador Masculino de would not be accepted in the TT. Therefore in line 68 of the ST shows as \"Male Television Announcer\" and in line 68 of the TT is translated as \"Presen tador de Televisi\u00f3n\" which is enough to identify that the announcer is a male. Source Text (ST) 68 MALE TELEVISION ANNOUNCER: Target Text (TT) 68 PRESENTADOR DE TELEVISI\u00d3N: 24. This specific example points out the expression of the person who is tal king in the documentary movie, then a Communicative rendering is appropriate within this context in order to illustrate in the TT exactly how the meaning comes from the original text. In lines 69 and 70 of the ST have been also applied Reordering since the phrase \"if it gets over\" was moved to the beginning of the sentence in lines 69 and 70 of the TT in order to offer a precise rendering to convey the meaning from the original message. Source Text (ST) 69 Uh, they'll close the factory if it gets 70 over 100 and evacuate . Target Text (TT) 69 Mm, con 100 ya cerrar\u00edan la f\u00e1brica 70 y evacuar\u00edan . 25. In line 74, there is a semantic problem in the ST in which the term \"demonstrating\" can cause confusion for the translator because The Beautiful Truth 58 option would be translating this word using a dictionary entry or a literal translation, such us \"demostrando\", but according to the context and the rest of lexical items involved in the sentence, this term has a particular meaning that goes beyond any dictionary word whe n rendering it into the TT. Also, we have used Divergence in which an element of the source text: \"demonstrating\" has some other alternatives to be translated, and has been rendered into more than a communicative meaning in the target text. In this case, the target lexicon presents more lexical items for encoding the meaning of that specific word within this text. Therefore, the most appropriate translation is: Source Text 71 Infuriated to the po int where they're 72 leaving their seats, and they're going 73 out becoming activists, and they're 74 demonstrating and writing letters. Target Text 71 Enfurecidos hasta el punto de 72 levantarse, salir y volverse activistas ; 73 est\u00e1n protestando en las calles y 74 escribiendo cartas. 26. Here we have applied Modulation, because there is a variation of the form of the SL message. According to our point of view, we have decided that one part of the sentence could be changed grammatically from a passive into a n active voice, making it a more natural rendering as it happened in lines 7 6 and 77 of the ST : \"not all the stuff that's been advertised \" will not sound so acceptable if it is transferred into the TT using the same type of voice; therefore, i n line 77, it was rendered as \"no eso que promocionan \" is more suitable the intended audience . There is also Amplification used in the last part of the expression in line 79 of both texts, in which \"all nonsense science fiction\" needed some additional and important The Beautiful Truth 59 lexical items to complete the whole meaning within the context, such as \"todo eso es disparate de ciencia ficci\u00f3n \" where the extra element \"disparate\" was added to the TT text to make it more accurate so it sounds more natural to the intended audience . According to this, our Text 75 Genetic engineering today means only 76 one thing - not all the stuff that's been 77 advertised, all the myths about more 78 food, more nutritious food, tastier food - 79 all nonse nse science fiction. Target Text 75 La ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica hoy en d\u00eda significa 76 una sola cosa - no eso que promocionan, 77 los mitos sobre abundancia, alimentos 78 m\u00e1s nutritivos, y de mejor sabor - 79 todo eso es disparate de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. 27. Here , we have used some Amplification, as we can see in lines 80 and 81 of both languages, where it says \"to food that is local\", when we rendered it into the TT as \"a los alimentos producidos localmente\", there is an important lexical item that needed to be added to the TT which is \"producidos\" so that the message is given in the most proper and acceptable way to match the meaning coming from the ST, and the same thing happened in the last item \"local\", which went from being an adjective in the ST to an ad verb in the TT \"localmente\" . Since there are many lexical and grammatical difference s between both languages, we had to adequate the message accordingly in order to make sense. Therefore, the use of this important technique allows us to get the most approp riate rendering to convey the same message given in the original text . This way, the translated text is fluent and sounds more natural . The most suitable translation is the following: The Beautiful Truth 60 Source Text 80 They're saying, \"Yes,\" to food that is 81 local, that is appropriate scale, that is 82 humane, that's biodiverse, and 83 that's socially just. Target Text 80 Est\u00e1n diciendo, \"S\u00ed\" a los alimentos 81 producidos localmente a una escala 82 apropiada, que es m\u00e1s humana, biodiversa 83 y socialmente justa. 28. In lines 8 5 and 8 6, they are using an informal expression \"was right in line to work\" that refers to someone who is selected, for being a successful and professional person, to do a specific job. In this part, the word \"line\" has many dictionary entries t hat have nothing to do with the context if it is translated in isolation, and that is why it is important to use a contextual translation. This expression has been amplified with some extra elements to achieve a communicate translation into the TT. Further more, there is Naturalization when rendering the information for the translation to look natural taking into account the target audience. According most and highly -respected 85 food engineer, Carol was right 86 in line to work with this 87 dangerous substance. Target Text 84 Siendo una ingeniera en alimentos bien 85 remunerada y respetada, Carol era la 86 persona m\u00e1s adecuada para trabajar 87 con esta sustancia peligrosa. 29. In the ST, line 92 , there is Reduction because the expression \"th at may catch on fire\" on this case, became irrelevant and repetitive when rendering it into the TT, so that it is omitted since redundancy is not appropriate in Sp anish Besides, the \"retort\" has dictionary entries which convey the same meaning from the original context, therefore, the most accurate translation of the ST word The Beautiful Truth 61 \"retort\" is \"crematorio\", for the t arget read er to understand the original message. In addition, note that we have used Reduction and Amplification the most suitable rendering for the intended audience in lines 91, 92 and 93 of the ST. T his expression \"because of all the excess body fluids that may catch on fire, and also cause the retort to burn down\" became \"debido al exceso de fluidos corporales combustibles que pueden hacer que el crematorio tambi\u00e9n se queme\" : Source Text 88 Also, if they can do that, they have to be 89 very careful of how they process the body 90 in the retort to prevent the retort from 91 catching on fire, because of all the excess 92 body fluids that may catch on fire, and 93 also cause the retort to burn down. Target Text 88 Y cuando pueden hacerlo, tienen que 89 tener mucho cuidado al procesar el 90 cuerpo en el crematorio para evitar 91 un incendio; debido al exceso de fluidos 92 corporales combustibles que pueden 93 hacer que el crematorio tambi\u00e9n se queme . 2.3.5. Cultural Translation Problems Cultural Tran slation caused by the different way people express themselves in the two cultures involved (source and target audience) because, as we know, every culture has its own customs, norms, principles, and so on. 30. In line 9 5, the use of \"up\" in th e expression \"up in Alaska\" in cultu ral problem in the TT because t he translation of \"up\" in Spanish is physical location \"arriba\", while what the speaker in the ST actually wants to indicate is that Alaska is geographically located in the north ern part of the country. The use of the term \"up\" to denote \"up north\" is customary because they are used to using maps more than in most of the Spanish -speaking cultures. Therefore, in this specific The Beautiful \"up\" was el iminated using geographical location of Alaska is already known. Source Text 94 This would actually be quite nice for 95 the cabin up in Alaska in the summer . Target Text 94 En realidad, esto ser\u00eda excelente para 95 la caba\u00f1a en Alaska en el verano. 31. In line s 96 and 97, this phrase \"the first that went, blood pressure\" becau se the English -speaking culture is more direct and practical with the use o f their language than the Spanish - speaking one is. There are some terms in English that can be even omitted and the message will still be understanda ble or it will be already implicit within the context. If we follow this example , we can notice that they a re talking about \" high blood pressure \" without using the term \"high\" , and when they say to \"diminish\" without really using it; therefore, in order to achieve a translation into Spanish at the readership's level, it is important to use some cultural modification and translate it as \" lo primero que les disminuye es la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea\" so that the Spanish - speaking audience can identify what exactly they are talking about as it is in this specific case where the ST has been cultur ally adapted into the target text since it was necessary in order to convey the most appropriate idea: Source Text 96 Patients that come here, the first that 97 went, blood pressure. Target Text 96 A los pacientes que vienen aqu\u00ed, lo primero 97 que les disminuye es la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea. The Beautiful Truth 63 CHAPTER III 3. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 3.1. Justification According to Bill Handel , Vice President of Sales & Marketing of Gerson Health Media , there is a lot of information about the natural health treatment named t he Gerson Therapy which needs to be translated into Spanish. This material includes movies, books, catalogs, and web -pages. He says that The Beautiful Truth is also a documentary movie in particular that needs to be transla ted to benefit the Spanish -speaking community . This movie will teach us about a therapy that has helped many patients to overcome their health problems by eating and get ting enough doses of nutrients. In accordance with the Gerson Health Media website , there are s ome real testimonies which show proof that this therapy works: Here is an example, a s mentioned in the movie \"Dying to Have Known\", also copyrighted by Gerson Media (www. GersonM edia.com): \" medical school professor who cured himself of liver canc er over 15 years ago, a lymphoma patient who was diagnose d as terminal over 50 years ago\". In addition, d octors who use the Gerson therapy convinced that vegetables juices are powerful tools to achieve good health and recommend patients to consume raw foods (i.e., uncooked vegetables and fruits) every day to recover from illness. The Beautiful Truth 64 Finally, Mr. Handel indicated that if we helped them with the Spanish translation, they would be able to bring Dr. Gerson's life saving information to the Spanish market a 12 t o 18 months sooner than expected. He stated: \"Imagine how many more lives we can save in that time.\" Next, we will present the responses to a questionnaire, a real story of how the therapy worked, and the case of a person who is looking for the information of the movie in Spanish. 3.2.1. Questionnaire Firstly, th is questionnaire and professionally the questions: 1) Why do consider necessary to translate the movie The Beautiful Truth into Sp anish? We at Gerson Media feel it is important and necessary to translate \"The Beautiful Truth\" into Spanish for many reasons and I will list the first few A. Most of the people world -wide who became aware of the Gerson Therapy and who benefitted from i mplementing it in their life, found out about it first by viewing one of our movies in English, The Beautiful Truth, The Gerson Miracle or Dying to Have Known . Having the Beautiful Truth available in Spanish will provide knowledge of the life saving benef its of The Gerson Therapy to the tens of millions of Spanish speaking people throughout the world... \u00b7 Nine countries in South America, ( Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina) The Beautiful Truth 65 \u00b7 Six Countries in Central America, ( Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1) \u00b7 Three Countries in the Caribbean, (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) \u00b7 One Country in Africa, ( Equatorial Guinea) \u00b7 The United States \u00b7 Canada \u00b7 Mexico \u00b7 Spain B. It is widely known that as the popularity of the diminished. The Internet viewing of movies, documentaries, training videos, independent news, commentaries, etc has gro wn exponentially and evidence for this is found in the fact that YouTube is now the second largest search engine in the world. With Spanish version of The Beautiful Truth being available free on the Internet, Spanish speaking people everywhere will have i nstant access to the movie and the important life saving information it provides. Additionally, they will be able to share it with family, friends and loved ones. Please note that the English versions of our movies are available on YouTube for FREE viewing and following is the number of views for each movie. The Beautiful Truth - 947,895 The Gerson Miracle - 210,554 The Beautiful Truth 66 Dying to Have Known - 192,792 C. While considering this answer, please ke ep in mind that this is a broad generalization and there are exceptions to every rule . Spanish people seeing Truth because they become aware of Gerson Therapy, a low cost health care system they can do by themselve s, for themselves and does not require the money, time and resources necessary to participate in the traditional \"Allopathic\" treatment of cancer and chronic When compared to western nations, most Spanish speaking counties have a much smaller \"In dex of Economic Freedom\" which is one of the best indictors of economic opportunity and prosperity. If people live in a country with good economic prosperity, they generally have the ability to afford quality health care. If they live in a country with ec onomic repression, their access and ability to afford health care is limited. It is an unfortunate reality that the majority of Spanish speaking people throughout the world are at the lower end of the economic scale, making it difficult, if not impossi ble sometimes, to afford quality health care. Although Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica and Cuba are rated highest among The Beautiful Truth 67 the Latin American nations - they are still only rated 22nd, 33rd, 36th and 39th in the world, respectively. Having access to a Spanish ver sion of The Beautiful Truth , which will in turn lead to people discovering The Gerson Therapy. Knowing about the Gerson Therapy gives people access to the best all natural solution for cancer and chronic disease available today. 2) Who will be benefic iaries of this translation? With the cancer rate of the Hispanic community in the US now being 1 in 2 and the diabetes rate being 1 in 3, access to an all natural solution that can be done inexpensively at home is a tremendous benefit. With the cancer and chronic disease rate on the rise throughout the world, all Spanish speaking people everywhere would benefit. 3) Why do you think the Spanish -speaking people should have access to this information? See answers above in regard to the affordability and econ omic access to health care. 4) What is the reason for which this movie has not been translated yet? Gerson Media simply has not had the budget personnel to facilitate about Media to a fantastic PR system that we would use to send press Spanish speaking write for magazines, newspapers, newsletters, and papers. We 68 would send these same announc ements to Spanish radio announcers and reporters at Spanish television stations. We will also make announcements via our world -wide radio show \"The Power of Natural Healing with Howard Straus\", Spanish based email newsletters, Spanish language pages on our current English website and announcements placed in our wholesale catalog that is mailed to 5000 organic food stores, health food stores, vitamin stores, herb shops, books stores and more. We would also begin developing a database of Spanish book stores, food markets, vitamin stores and more in which we would then mail a Spanish products catalog. Bill Handel Vice President of Sales & Marketing Gerson Health Media (P) 530 -529-1100 (E) bill@gersonmedia.com www.gersonmedia.com 3.2.2. A Real Case about the Gerson Therapy There is a very particular case about the unbelievable story of Carla Shuford, a bone cancer s urvivor. When she was 15 years old in 1958, Carla was diagnosed with osteogenic sarcoma, a common type of bone cancer in children that originates mainly in the bones of the legs. When di the cancer the hip, they told her that she would only have 6 months to live. With this prognosis, Carla's mother did not give up hope and went looking for Dr. Max The Beautiful Truth 69 Gerson at his New York clinic. Due to the extreme demands of his therapy, Dr. Gerson rarely allowed patients to follow the treatment at home. However, he decided to trust Carla's mother, and this was how Carla was cared by her devoted family receiving the strict Gerson therapy five years. For juicing and meals, they needed organic produce, which were obtained from their own farm and the farms of friends, who were happy to help with Carla's treatment by dedicating parts of their death sentence given by her doctors in 1 958 when she was 15, Carla is still alive. She must be turning 70 this year. Carla remains on a strictly organic diet, and enjoys swimming daily. She is an active member in her local organic community in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Last year, she gave an interview for a project documenting the Carrboro Farmers' Market for the Southern Foodways Alliance, and spoke of her experience on the Gerson diet, and how it has led to a lifelong passion for organic produce. (The http://gerson.org/gerpress/carla -osteogenic -sarcoma/ ). has helped many people to learn about the existence of this therapy, s he has been the inspiration for others to try out the different and natural alternative. This is absolute ly remarkable because there is hope, and people need to be aware of this incredible way of being healthy. A video with the interview that Carla gave to the Southern Foodways Alliance in is name is Rossana Mendoza Ibarra (R), who lives in Dallas, TX, USA. Rossana has lived there for about 10 years. She is The Beautiful Truth 70 originally from Ecuador, so her mother tongue is Spanish. She was interviewed by us Yessenia Gallardo (Y) and Mar\u00eda Agustina Cede\u00f1o (M). The interview was done in Spanish because Rossana does not know enough English, but here we present it translated from Spanish to English for the purposes of this thesis. M: Hello Rossana, we are two students of the UCSG Translation program working on our graduation thesis, which consists of translating the movie The Beautiful Truth from English to Spanish, and we heard that you were interested in seeing the movie. The purpose of this interview is to learn more about this interest of you. Now, we will start with the questions: M: How did you learn about this movie and why are you interested in seeing it? R: Some of my colleagues at work were talking about a movie about cancer and other degenerative dis eases and how they could be cured with a natural method very different from chemotherapy. Some people I know who have cancer suffer a lot from this awful chemo. Besides, they said that this therapy people with blood pressure problems, obesi ty, diabetes, and many other health issues, and because I personally have some health problems, I got very interested in it. Since then, I have been looking for this information but it is available only in English, and my English is not good enough to unde rstand it totally. Y: How do you think this information would benefit you if it were available in Spanish? The Beautiful Truth 71 R: I think I will be able to have the choice to decide whether to go for the therapy or to continue with the traditional medical treatment that I am under nowadays. One good reason for learning about this natural therapy is that I can be informed on time and prevent further health complications. Of course, my main goal would be to find the cure for all my health problems. M: What kind of health problem s do you have? R: My main problem is related to blood pressure and for that I need to take traditional medicine daily to avoid the symptoms, but I am sick and tired of it. Besides, I have had some weight problems since I had my third child, and I have not been able to go back to my original weight. My co -workers said that if using this therapy, I could lose weight and recover my health in a great deal, and that is why I would really like to get all the information in my own language so I can learn more abou t it. Y: Do you know anyone who would also be interested in this movie? R: Yes my colleagues, the ones who were talking about the movie. They said that someone else told them about it, and that they have also been looking for this information in Spani sh, but they have not found it yet. My family and friends in Ecuador would like to learn more about it too. M: With respect to the movie, do you know how dental mercury based amalgams and a food flavor R: Oh really! I know there are many people who have those dark amalgam fillings on their teeth but I did not know that they were bad for your The Beautiful Truth 72 health. If they are that bad, why do dentist keep using them? Do they know that they are harmf ul? I myself have a couple of those fillings. One more reason to see the movie, then. With regard to the food flavor -enhancer I really have no idea. M: In the movie, they explain why the amalgam fillings and the Monosodium Glutamate are not safe for e. Now, supposing that you had a chronic disease and can choose between the traditional medicine with pills, injections, etc., and a therapy based fruits and with both methods choose and why? R: I would definitely go for the most natural way of treating any kind of disease. I am really tired of too many pharmaceutical drugs. They may cure some of your health problems, but on the other hand, they can also harm you badly. Y: Thank you very much Rossa na for your time and your useful answers . We really hope that our contribution to the Gerson Institute with the translation of this movie help s you, your family, your friends and many others in the near future. Name: Rossana Mendoza Ibarra Email: rossanam 71@yahoo.com Dallas, TX - USA 3.3. Discussion First of all, as we can see in the questionnaire responses , Mr. Bill Handel clearly emphasized how important the translation of the Movie The The Beautiful Truth 73 Beautiful Truth would He listed reasons being the main one the life saving benefits that many English -speaking people have already obtained by learning and using the natural therapy that the Gerson Institute provides. He also stated that the Movi e The Beautiful Truth is the most visited one among their movies on YouTube. Besides, Mr. Handel mentioned that if the translation is done , the benefit would be as well for the tens of millions of Spanish -speaking people around the world, highlight ing in this way how large and how important this community is in our society worldwide. B esides, as he said , since the majority of this community does not have an easy access and ability to afford health care due to economic limitations, the translation of this mo vie would be very convenient for them as the access to this information will be free on the Internet. It will be broadcast on YouTube, which is now the second largest search engine in the world , according to Mr. Handel . Also, the institute will run campaig ns promoting through television, radio, catalogs, the internet, and direct mail, the availability of the new Gerson Media material in the Spanish language. This effort will guarantee that the Spanish version of this movie the majority of the Spanis h-speaking community . Continuing with this analysis, we can see how the information of the Gerson therapy, which is available in this documentary movie, was very useful and somehow saved Carla Shuford's life since she used this therapy to treat her bone ca ncer that she was diagnosed with when she was only a 15-year-old girl. This lady has become an inspiration for many people who learned about her way of living healthy and well , thanks to the therapy. The Beautiful Truth 74 Last but not least, it is important to mention that the respondent (Rossana Mendoza Ibarra) of our interview above is not alone. There are many other people in the US in a similar situation. Figure 2 illustrates how large the Spanish speaking community in the US is , according to the 2012 US Census. Over 100 lan guages are spoken in the US, but the 2012 US Census reports that Spanish is the most common language among non -native English speakers. Communicating with the Latino market in Spanish is not a courtesy; it is a requirement! Much of the Spanish speaking pop ulation in the US is not fluent in English. In fact, nearly 50% of itself skills graduation project. When Spanish - speaking people start learning about the information included in the movie and they begin getting all the benefits from it, we will be able to see that our research w as done with a mission in mind, which is to make this important information available in Spanish so everyone who speaks that language can have access to it, and that will be our contribution to society . The Beautiful Truth 76 CHAPTER IV 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4.1. CONCLUSIONS As a conclusion, it is important to mention that in the translation process, professional translators should be especially familiar with an advanced level of mastery of a foreign language, in this case, English or Span ish, whichever is considered to be the second language; furthermore, with the cultural part of the intended audience. When analyzing translations in a scientific way, the annotation process is a very important tool for the translator to transmit his lingui stic knowledge of the field rendering as as his experience applied during the process of translating any text from the source to the target language, since it identifies any potential translation problems and at the same time it offers som e possible solutions with their corresponding explanations. Moreover, translators must be informed and information intended to be translated including some backgrounds, in our case, we are immersed in these nutritional issues to give an accurate and reliable message from the information we have gathered during the research process. The Beautiful Truth 77 4.2. RECOMMENDATIONS In our research project we have conducted the translation from English to Spanish of a documentary movie script, in which have bee n applied different translation techniques and methods that have helped us analyze each problems that the rendering of it encountered. Besides, it has been a great experience for us to investigate about the most renowned experts in Lingu istics, whose theories have been the majority of this research. We recommend everyone to read our research paper and in that way get involved in how a translation could be an important tool and means to transmit a message from one language to a nother, and how the result of it can make a difference in people's lives. Our recommendation to the Gerson Institute for the near future will be to carry out the dubbing of the movie so that will be a good alternative apart from the translation which will also benefit the Spanish -speaking community.

The Beautiful Truth 92 01:02:32:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: As far back as he can remember, his family has worked with orphaned wildlife, and so his understanding of biology was hands on there, too. 01:02:42:06 Thanks in part to a special book written by a Dr. Max Gerson. 01:02:47:15 He understood how important it is to feed a young creature, such as this porcupine, the right mix of foods, or that creature would succumb quickly, especially in its first few days life. 01:03:10:17 STEVE KROSCHEL: Regular visits to our neighbor, Bob, provided this un -pasteurized goats she recently heard from Garrett about Dr. Gerson, and then word spread in the community about this Gerson therapy. 01:03:33:22 People that were dee ply impacted positively included the Mayor, the local electrician, the banker, the Hammer Museum guy. 01:03:48:14 Then there was the Beekeeper who saw links to the Gerson therapy that extended even to the health and productivity of his bees. 01:03:56:13 There was also the artist, the people at the organic store, and then a Gerson tape was obtained. 01:04:06:01 CHARLOTTE GERSON: There are laws against healing cancer. 01:04:08:09 The doctor is not allowed to try anything else. 01:04:11:05 He must use only those treatments that have already proven to be failures. 01:04:16:20 Imagine what we could do if this could be accepted. 01:04:20:07 But there are laws against it; you're not allowed to heal. 01:04:23:01 There's too much money to be on drugs. 01:04:25:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: For Garrett's diabetic neighbor, John, this message came too late to save his legs. 01:04:30:20 But perhaps Bob the milkman has the about the Gerson therapy. 01:04:35:27 BOB: What I'd like to see is some proof, some good scientific proof. 01:04:41:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: When a cruise ship came to town, many visitors would come to learn about the wildlife that Garrett cared for. 01:04:46:14 He found it surprising how unfamiliar most people were about wild animals an d their requirements. 01:05:04:03 STEVE KROSCHEL: The news of this situation eventually got back to Dr. Gerson's daughter, Charlotte, who sent Garrett a little gift. 01:05:21:09 It was a new book written by Charlotte that spelled out how Dr. Gerson's the Even a 15 -year-old could find the text a good read. The Beautiful Truth 93 01:05:34:12 The chapters were profound and seemed too good to be true. 01:05:38:02 Points were made that sparked curiosity to learn more. 01:05:47:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: This to become a new chapter in Garrett's life. 01:05:51:25 Up to this time, reading a book cover to cover was a rarity for him. 01:05:55:26 But in this instance it was different, du e partly in what the book addressed, it was what he observed day to day even when doing the most mundane chores. 01:06:05:23 What Garrett had not fully realized was the implications of the potency and vegetation. therapy was accepted it would help change the history of mankind's modern agriculture, food supply, healt h care systems, economy, and of course, the environment. 01:06:48:21 Then Garrett learned a lesson in being misunderstood one day when his father cleaned the house and tossed an art work piece that Garrett had made into the trash. 01:06:56:28 Because of its unusual design, the community garbage collector fished it out and gave it to local police, who declared it a bomb, definitely a blow to Garrett's creativity. 01:07:05:21 Other situations then took their boy, and Garrett's straight -A record sunk. 01:07:11:07 His father decided he needed to be home schooled. 01:07:13:23 His first home schooled lesson was about Dr. Gerson and... 01:07:17:10 BOB: I'd like to see some scientific proof. The boy wasn't sure how that would be accomplished, but he did draw out an analogy between gold mining and human nature, to start with. 01:07:32:04 He decided the best place to start his research would be the public library. 01:07:36:15 It didn't take much time before he located se veral independent sources that confirmed important points, as outlined in Gerson's 01:07:46:11 From those important leads, the dubious characters that make up the history of the use of fluoride fascinated the boy. 01:07:53:21 He dug for more information, and then more skeletons were uncovered. 01:07:58:08 Then Garrett began to assemble a what needed to be accomplished to successfully confirm the Gerson Protocol. 01:08:06:07 It was when the words about hope w ere written that I made an inquiry to become involved in helping him document the integrity the Therapy. The Beautiful Truth 94 01:08:15:22 GARRETT: First there's Gerald Cox, who worked for the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. 01:08:20:23 The Mellon Institute , by the way, was the leading defender for the asbestos industry. 01:08:25:26 Gerald Cox became interested in the fluoride from the suggestions of Francis Frary, the director of the aluminum laboratory of Alcoa. 01:08:35:02 And then came a leading scient ist in toxicology, Dr. Harold Hodge. 01:08:39:22 Harold the safety of fluoride, but under the combined pressures of the Atomic Commission and aluminum manufacturing, he had to say it was safe. 01:08:55:12 GARRETT: Harold Hodge, along with a group of scientists, helped develop the atom bomb. 01:08:59:25 Then there was Dr. Robert Kehoe, who worked for the Kettering Laborat ory. 01:09:04:24 Back in the '50s, Mr. Kehoe was industrial evangelist for the Ethyl Corporation, promoting the safety of lead in gasoline at the time. 01:09:14:20 Frank L. Seamans was the attorney of Alcoa and the head of the Fluorine Lawyers Committee. 01:09:21:02 And then there was a beagle dog study, in which these dogs had to breathe fluoridated air six days a week. 01:09:27:08 Well, the dogs sustained stupendous damage to their lungs lymph system. 01:09:32:04 information should have been given to doctors and but instead Fluorine Lawyer's Committee, and was buried. 01:09:39:29 And then came Edward Bernays, the nephew of Sigmund Freud, the wizard of public relations. 01:09:45:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: Selling fluorid e for public water supplies was easy for Bernays. 01:09:48:21 He used the slogan \"Trust your Doctor.\" 01:09:51:06 To day, even fluoride tablets are dispensed to children, thanks in part for the need to use fluoride to build the atom bomb. 01:09:58:0 8 MAN ON TELEVISION: I am represent one mile on your camera. 01:10:01:03 The top part, two miles. 01:10:02:15 We're going to switch to another camera. 01:10:04:02 to move out of here. 01:10:05:18 MALE VOICE: Three, two, one, zero. 01:10:13:0 0 The shock wave will arrive in the control point area in approximately half a minute. The Beautiful Truth 95 01:10:47:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: In declassified government documents, the Commission stated of its use of fluoride and questionable safety record in building the bo mb that \"information which would invite or tend to encourage claims against Atomic Commission or its contractors, such portions of articles deleted. 01:11:08:21 Parallels can be drawn from this to in the making about... cell phones? 01:11:13:27 A $28 million grant was given to George Carlos in the '90s to prove cell phone safety, but instead he be paid transmissions are how they affect insects. 01:11:29:17 GARRETT: Do they teach this in public schools? 01:11:33:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: But when it comes to dental health, diet, not fluoride can play a huge role. 01:11:38:03 This became vivid for Garrett as he assisted on minor surgery of his tame wolf. 01:11:43:12 The perfect, cavity -free teeth of the wolf pointed to facts in a book he had just finished studying from the library. 01:11:52:06 It was called Degeneration , distingu Dr. Weston 01:12:02:21 Dr. Price traveled the world with his wife in the 1930's to visit Native cultures that had never been exposed to modern civilization's diet of white flour, canned food and sugar. his amazem averaged less of noted something else. 01:12:20:05 None of the people in these different tribes and cultures practiced any sort of dental hygiene. 01:12:24:18 Not one of his subjects had e ver used a toothbrush. 01:12:28:11 But once them, tooth decay and disease followed, and it was the beginning of the end of the uniformly hardy and strong. 01:12:41:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: between human skull formation and diet. 01:12:58:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: And yet in present the subject of fluoride is still debated. 01:13 :03:10 In the state capital of Juneau, Alaska, I met up with the city's Chief Dental Officer. The Beautiful Truth 96 01:13:09:23 CHIEF DENTAL OFFICER: Um, for the State of Alaska's position on water fluoridation, the Department of Health and Social Services and the Division of Public Health support water fluoridation. 01:13:17:24 But in Alaska it is a local initiative, and what's going on in Juneau is a local vote on Juneau resuming water fluoridation. 01:13:24:09 So, while the Department supports this, this is really a - a local issue, and I'm also involved with the Citizens for Dental Health, um, Coalition, but that's not in my capacity as State Dental Officer. 01:13:36:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: Do you think that fluoride will think there's clear evidence over the past fluoride reduces decay are from topi cal application not from drinking it. 01:13:53:05 Garrett needed to see both sides of 01:13:56:02 He then viewed compelling scenes footage I there's therapy. 01:14:11:12 DR. WALLACE not at all. not. 01:14:18:18 They won't even release their records. 01:14:20:09 DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: There's absolutely 01:14:29:21 KROSCHEL: 01:14:32:16 from ever y type of cancer. 01:14:35:21 And, for many of them, it was terminal. 01:14:37:18 Orthodox medicine had given up on them and sent them all home to die. 01:14:41:18 Some of them published books about their recoveries. 01:14:44:04 I traveled all over the world, from Holland to Japan, and everywhere it was the same result: recovery. 01:14:59:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: And even heart arteries can be restored. The Beautiful Truth 97 01:15:08:07 STEVE KROSCHEL: When Prince Charles spoke publicly in favor of the Gerson therapy after obser ving its effectiveness, he was Nevertheless, I had observed his unwavering sentiments in a letter that was sent to the Gerson Institute. 01:15:28:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Charlotte Gerson routinely gives lectures about her famous therapy all over the world. 01:15:34:07 CHARLOTTE GERSON: Dr. Gerson said, \"Two basic things are toxicity and deficiency.\" 01:15:40:27 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett was on the right track with his home school schedule, and what he had just seen drew him in even deeper. 01:15:47:25 Now the world began to appear slightly more to him. 01:15:52:01 therapy within mainstream media sources. 01:16:14:19 STEVE KROSCHEL: Instead, what he discovered within the pages of any given article about cancer or chronic disease was a different approach to the crisis, one that made him suspici ous. 01:16:26:21 Garrett wanted to learn more, and to his delight, the Gerson family sent him some long -forgotten film reels. 01:16:32:25 Dr. Gerson's image with his family came to life. 01:16:44:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: There was the discovery of footage of Charlotte Gerson in her twenties that captured his imagination within the historical reference of the where, why, and how this family eventually ended up in the United States from Germany. 01:17:11:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: As a young doctor in Germany, Max Gers on's inspiration was Hungarian medical researcher, Dr. Ignaz Gerson he discovered a cure for his migraine headaches and then tuberculosis, by changing the diet. 01:17:37:13 A clinical trial was tuberculosis patients . 01:17:43:14 None of them recovered at first, and Gerson was devastated. 01:17:47:00 But then it was discovered that a nurse sneaking pastries, beer and sausages to the patients. 01:17:53:23 The Gerson diet was then strictly followed, leading to th e recovery of 446 of the 450 patients. The Beautiful Truth 98 01:18:03:12 Then he discovered it cured cancer. 01:18:08:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: In World War II, Gerson was able to flee Nazi persecution with his family to the United States. 01:18:14:21 He continued to not only cure cancer, but other chronic diseases, too. 01:18:18:14 And when his close friend, Dr. Albert Schweitzer suffered from diabetes, he cured Dr. Schweitzer as well, leading Schweitzer to assess and declare that Gerson was, quote, \"The most imminent in me commentator, Raymond Swing , over ABC radio. 01:18:45:04 The public's reaction was swift and favorable. 01:18:47:19 But the broadcast resulted in the firing of Raymond Graham Swing two weeks later, due to severe pressure by the Pharmaceutical and American Medical Establishment. 01:18:57:13 VOICE OF DR. MAX GERSON: I was investigated five times. 01:19:01:12 VOICE OF do you by being DR. MAX GERSON: Yes. Five times. 01:19:07:19 Every time they come, I showed them the patients you sent home to die, cured. 01:19:15:03 All the you home to die, to die, 23:07 STEVE KROSCHEL: And cure he did, including people with muscular dystrophy, like this young girl. 01:19:31:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Gerson's example, against tobacco since 1920. 01:19:40:24 MALE TELEVISION ANNOUNCER: Time out for many men of medicine usually means just long enough to enjoy a cigarette. 01:19:46:11 And because they know what a pleasure it is to smoke a mild, good -tasting cigarett e, they're particular about the brand they choose. 01:19:54:25 In a repeated national survey, doctors in all branches of medicine, doctors in all parts of the country were asked, \"What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?\" 01:20:05:10 Once again, the brand na med most was Camel. 01:20:08:21 Yes, according to this repeated nation -wide survey, more smoke than any other cigarette. The Beautiful Truth 99 01:20:16:04 Why not change to Camels for the next 30 days and see what a difference it makes in your smoking enjoyment mild -tasting a cigarette can be. 01:20:29:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: And as more layers of the therapy were uncovered and understood, it was becoming clear to why wa s such opposition to Gerson's therapy of The boy remembered the superior effectiveness in a remedy his father had use d on his foot. 01:20:48:24 Costly and toxic pharmaceuticals had not worked. merely dicing a few cloves of mixed with raw his foot It was used as a cleanser in the home, and was even found useful cosmetically would even prevent the common cold. 01:21:28:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: There are volumes written about natural cures and treatments. Knowledge 01:21:43:05 And so, Garrett's home school lesson went to a new level. 01:21:46:22 It was time for him to take his home work on the road, and put it all to the ultimate test. 01:22:03:23 STEVE KROSC HEL: The entire foundation for Garrett's study and scientific analysis of Gerson's treatment commenced around breakfast with Charlotte Gerson in San Diego. 01:22:12:19 Charlotte Gerson's son, Howard Strauss, and a distinguished guest who had just arrived from Slovenia, also would join us. 01:22:19:24 It was here that Garrett would compare his notes Dr. Gerson's claims with unrelated sources to truly match up. 01:22:29:24 HOWARD STRAUS: Dental amalgam, and its - by the way, denti sts like to call it \"alloy\" because it makes it sound so much more stable. 01:22:37:00 But dental amalgam is the biggest and the worst exposure to mercury that most Americans have in their lives. 01:22:45:01 STEVE KROSCHEL: If that is true, then millions of people have needlessly suffered a plethora of ills for well over a century, and didn't realize the true cause was all in their heads. The Beautiful Truth 100 01:22:55:17 I was about to film a demonstration that proved this beyond a shadow of a doubt. 01:23:01:03 Dr. Roger E ichman and Dr. David Kennedy set up a phosphorescent screen and light that would be sensitive to mercury vapor coming off the tooth if it was present after even the slightest stimulation. 01:23:13:24 We had teeth with amalgam fillings placed in water of just room temperature, to represent saliva in the mouth. 01:23:20:26 I did not truly believe mercury vapor would come off the tooth, or if it did, that the film camera would register it. 01:23:27:01 I also had a hand to recor d this event. 01:23:36:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: To my shock and horror, and, as you can see, the 35 mm motion picture camera did register the mercury vapor coming off the tooth. 01:23:50:11 This is the first time in history this has ever been captured on a film camera. 01:24:01:29 STEVE KROSCHEL: To make certain that what you are seeing is mercury, we had on hand a special instrument called a Jerome Mercury Sniffer to measure the levels. 01:24:12:14 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: 191. 01:24:14:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: 190. Sh ow that to me, please. 01:24:16:17 191. Is that high? 01:24:18:20 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Uh, they'll close the factory if it gets over 100 and evacuate. 01:24:22:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: Oh boy. My gosh. you think 01:24:26:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: Turn off the light. 01:24:27:17 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: This is room temperature, one tooth, at least 50 years old. 01:24:32:24 It's been - been de -gassing for years, and, um, many people have a whole mouth full of them. 01:24:41:12 STEVE KROSCHEL: Yeah. 01:24:41:26 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Now, just think what happens if you have half a dozen people in a, uh, elevator all de -gassing like this, uh, and is degassing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 01:24:55:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: Yeah . 01:24:55:13 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: based on a 40 -hour week. 01:24:59:25 STEVE KROSCHEL: Next, Dr. Kennedy set up on the counter an amalgam mixer, which Dentists use in their office to mix the amalgam capsules, which after mixing , are broke amalgam capsules then lined up one by one on a shaker where they are shaken for a time. The Beautiful Truth 101 01:25:23:16 With an unsuspecting patient nearby, the cap sules are then broke open, just as any dentist or dental assistant will do. 01:25:30:13 Will mercury vapor be released? 01:25:32:12 At this point, I was pretty sure what the answer would be. 01:25:36:06 Remember, this is common procedure and goes on eac h and every day all over the world in dental offices next to innocent American STEVE KROSCHEL: Turn the light. Can we see what we got? 01:26:09:11 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Uh, worse working in a dental office. 01:26:19:20 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: I think it's a crime what they're doing to their dental staff, is that the fem ale is much more sensitive, reproductive -wise, to mercury, and as a result Of course, you get the usual denials, but when you look at the scientific literature, it is full of stu dies showing that exposure to mercury - either from your teeth or working in a dental office will... 01:26:44:03 You know, you saw the demonstration. 01:26:45:21 There's of mercury that, they don't warn don't give them it. 01:26:59:24 It's about the Norwegian den tal nurses, and about their lives being devastated by their job when they were young girls. 01:27:06:15 So, I think it's a crime what they're doing to these young girls. 01:27:10:01 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: I've had patients come in, uh, from other dentists sa ying, \"Gee, all I had was my teeth cleaned, and I feel lousy for days after that, every time. How come?\" 01:27:20:16 Well, they polish the teeth, they amount of mercury being released for several days after that, until you get a little bit of c orrosion over the top, which slows it down a little bit. 01:27:34:01 Um, but the amount of mercury released is just phenomenal. 01:27:39:00 And if they're sensitive to it, it'll put them over the edge. The Beautiful Truth 102 01:27:42:12 When I was in dental school, I was told that dentists were averaging their first heart attack by age 44. 01:27:50:02 Our life expectancy was age 52. 01:27:53:25 I personally related that to their use of amalgam fillings, because it wasn't occurring surgeons. 01:28:05:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: I had made certain that Garrett was nowhere near this demonstration, to ensure he did not inhale any mercury vapor. 01:28:12:03 Yet that seemed absurd when considering that many people are walking around with amalgams in their mouths. 01:28:18:05 Dr. Gerson was right all along. 01:28:20:13 Dental health is paramount to healing from chronic disease. 01:28:27:08 STEVE KROSCHEL: In Colorado Springs, Colorado, there is one renowned dentist who has spoken out about fluor ide, dental amalgams, and even the dangers of root canals for decades. 01:28:37:09 His name is Dr. Hal Huggins. 01:28:40:02 But just before we were about to meet him, Garrett fell into a depression. 01:28:44:22 He couldn't Roger Eichman gave. 01:28:52:11 This home school lesson had hit him hard. 01:28:57:03 And then the cause of his sadness was revealed. 01:29:00:03 The boy's parents had unwittingly allowed som e to stick the mercury inside his mouth, too. 01:29:05:02 He now saw himself as a biohazard. 01:29:07:17 But the good news was that he was about to meet Dr. Hal Huggins, who would give him some reassuring direction. 01:29:13:07 DR. HAL HUGGINS: Well, most of the people I see who are having their amalgams removed have some sort you're interested in prevention? 01:29:22:01 Then you are one in 100 who's in a very good position, because prevention is a safe. 01:29:34:17 DR. HAL HUGGINS: Well that would be pretty close to 100% if they want to be in dentistry tomorr ow. 01:29:38:28 Because the dental if a dentist is asked, \"Is mercury toxic?\" and they say anything affirmative - they say, \"Well, yes it is; it's the most poisonous metal on the planet that's not - not radioactive\" - uh, they're gonna lose their license and be selling used cars the next day. The Beautiful Truth 103 01:29:59:07 So, what they believe and what they can say, two different things. 01:30:03:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: Then he wanted to know which dentists how to remove fillings properly. 01:30:06:27 DR. HAL HUGGINS: Those people who go out and just have their fillings removed at random, uh, by actual measurement, 63% end up with an autoimmune disease within six months that they did not have before they had their amalgam s removed. 01:30:21:24 Something that very few people know - I just found out recently - is that dentists have malpractice insurance. 01:30:29:04 Yes, okay, that's fine. 01:30:31:09 But, when a dentist takes mercury and the powder of copper and tin and zinc and silver, mixes it together, he is now a manufacturer, and dentists do not have manufacturer's product liability insurance. 01:30:46:23 So, the hit is gonna fall on them where they are not insured. 01:30:50:11 That they are putting a poisonous sub stance into people's mouths and they have no protection from it. 01:30:57:24 So, the legal profession is going to tear them apart, as I see it. 01:31:03:22 Uh, if we look 5, 10 years down the line, the only people who can take out your amalgams are gonna be the lawyers. 01:31:09:20 STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Huggins guided Garrett to a dentist that did know how to safely remove his filling. 01:31:14:13 The boy remembered a asked Dr. Huggins about retaliation for speaking out. 01:31:20:07 DR. H AL HUGGINS: Yes, there have been a number of cases of retaliation. 01:31:23:16 The first thing that they did was put up an enormous amount of money to see to it my license was removed for refusing to place amalgam, for refusing to do root canals on patien ts, and writing a book they didn't like. 01:31:37:24 There have been personal things that have been done against me and my family, which destroyed the family. 01:31:44:11 The rest of it destroyed the business. 01:31:46:21 They've destroyed everything I had except the mortgage on my home, and for some reason or another, they did not want that. 01:31:56:13 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett reasoned that life could have been so much easier for him if he had just kept quiet, like most doctors do. 01:32:02:17 So, the question became... 01:32:04:14 GARRETT: Why put yourself through this? 01:32:08:16 DR. HAL HUGGINS: When you have seen the people that I have seen, and you see that their life just has a few minutes, a few hours before it runs out, and you see that that can be turned around, and you see that years later these people do have a life, that's the payment that I get. The Beautiful Truth 104 That's I keep doing It was a ideological that reminded Garrett of Dr. Gerson. 01:32:33:18 But it's still as David and Goliath. 01:32:36:02 In this situation, the American Dental Association wields tremendous power and control over a dentist's life, and the dentist that performed the procedure of proper filling remo val on Garrett was terrified of his identity being captured for this movie. 01:32:49:29 Documents had to be signed, which meant that I was personally liable to him for the ruining of his career and income if I did film his face. 01:33:02:14 STEVE KROSCHE L: Hearings on mercury fillings are now taking place in Washington D.C. that hopefully will put an end to this amalgam disaster. 01:33:10:00 It is estimated that there is 1000 tons of mercury in the fillings of Americans at the moment. 01:33:15:19 Incred ibly, the FDA has never conducted an environmental assessment of the use of dental mercury amalgam, as prescribed by law. 01:33:24:29 CHARLOTTE GERSON: It is very important for the orthodox people to keep, uh, patients from coming to, uh, alternative treatments, because they work. 01:33:34:12 People have been so brainwashed for so long. 01:33:37:17 STEVE KROSCHEL: But what could possibly Monosodium Glutamate is actually - it turns off the switch in your brain that says, \"I've had enough to an excitotoxin? 01:34:03:06 There are thousands of studies and enough papers on the subject to fill a small library. 01:34:07:16 The evidence has accumulated, and then accumulated some more. 01:34:11:26 It's there for anyone t o read. 01:34:13:23 But the processed food industry is hoping the media and the average person is too busy, lazy or unsophisticated enough to be able to understand the subtleties of the science being discussed. 01:34:29:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: But just in cas e the average lay person does show a bit of curiosity about the dangers of flavor enhancers like MSG, the industry has smartly printed little rack cards and brochures to give us, defending their crisp position. The Beautiful Truth 105 01:34:44:05 Garrett met with food exper ts, Jack and Adrienne Samuels, of Truth 01:34:49:19 JACK SAMUELS: acid is very, very complex. 01:34:55:00 And consequently, many games can be played to try to convince people that it is safe. 01:35:03:17 They removed replaced monosodium glutamate with other ingredients that gave the consumer no clue to the presences of component 01:35:18:25 After being told by my physician - who experienced one of my reactions to MSG - that I would soon die from MSG, uh, exposure if I didn't learn to avoid it, uh, Adrienne used her background in research and went to the library, spending some 4,000 hours to read everything she could find abo ut MSG. 01:35:42:04 Uh, to her surprise, she found there were studies that indicated that MSG was safe, but they were all sponsored by the glutamate industry or their agents, and were all flawed to the point of being worthless. 01:35:58:23 And, at the sa me time, there were many other studies that clearly demonstrated that MSG was toxic and dangerous. 01:36:06:08 STEVE KROSCHEL: Jack and Adrienne Samuels have an extremely comprehensive snapshot of MSG research done since research really began on this addi tive. 01:36:14:24 Garrett still wanted to play the devil's advocate, and researched the research, because now it was becoming clearer to him during this home school lesson that each side of an issue has reasons they take a position. 01:36:26:21 The chall enge is to ascertain the driving force behind any given scientific study. 01:36:32:11 It is money or morals? 01:36:35:26 But what the boy discovered - like Jack and Adrienne Samuels found - is that there is no person, institution or agency that has claim ed that MSG is safe that does not have close ties to food and/or drug industries, or that has not been remunerated by them. 01:36:54:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: Neuroscientist Dr. it incites. 01:37:04:04 DR. JOHN OLNEY: My background is in experimental neuropathology. 01:37:08:01 I, uh, conducted a study of monosodium glutamate and its toxicity potential for infant I found th destroys nerve 106 camera, he has played a key role in the incriminating evidence against the processed food ind ustry for several years. 01:37:40:27 His findings are shocking to people, especially to parents of young children. 01:37:46:12 But when traveling away from home, the question then becomes for Garrett, \"What do you eat?\" 01:37:51:05 At his home in Alaska or visiting the Gerson family, his diet was virtually devoid of any processed food. 01:37:57:13 It takes a little extra work to seek out organic produce and/or restaurants. think - it's too late. 01:38:11:17 The chemicals in this fast food were working their magic on the boy. 01:38:15:11 He ate this meal - actually, two meals - like he was possessed. 01:38:19:02 To me, it was disappointing, but to force the issue would l ikely backfire. 01:38:23:16 He was free to his own decisions. 01:38:37:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: Three hours later, on a plane headed for Jackson, Mississippi, the results were in. 01:38:51:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: In Jackson, Mississippi, the boy met up with a n incredible family of photographers, the Blaylocks. 01:38:59:07 Dr. books on excitotoxins and health. 01:39:08:25 He is a leading voice in the effort to make the p ublic aware of this health atrocity. 01:39:13:21 Perhaps \"atrocity\" is too strong of a word. 01:39:17:08 If what he says is true, it's hard to think of any other. 01:39:22:10 It is here where Garrett reoriented himself to a healthy snack. 01:39:26:15 But, unbeknownst to the lad, I had a little test planned. 01:39:29:27 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: The mass consumption of this substance in the food is interfering with people's ability to think and remember and use language, so that our children no longer have the capacity that their parents had. 01:39:43:14 And I think this is getting compounded, because there are more and more foods with multiple forms of this excitotoxins: four, five, six in a single food. 01:39:53:01 So, there are children - and small children in particular - are consuming such large amounts, it interferes with the development of the brain, as well as destroying these connections between the brain cells. 01:40:04:15 And that interferes with brain function. 01:40:06:10 And that 's what we're seeing nation -wide, and in fact, world - wide in the industrialized nations. The Beautiful Truth 107 01:40:11:25 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: The reason that the food manufacturers are telling the public it is safe is 01:40:18 And it's hard to compete with their fellow manufacturers if they don't use so, they just tend to ignore all of this research, even though it's literally thousands of studies. proving beyond any doubt in the reasonable of diseases are happening MSG 01:40:52:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: Chips were delivered to the table that were laden with MSG. 01:40:56:01 Had Garrett done his homework? 01:40:57:13 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: One of the things that people don't understand, this can be a silent, uh, toxicity. 01:41:02:09 That is, they don't even know it's occurring. 01:41:04:22 Uh, a lot of tell me, I don't react. 01:41:06:28 I don't omiting and headaches.\" 01:41:10:11 Uh, well, a lot of people that are exposed to MSG will not have these symptoms, but they get the same damage. 01:41:16:25 And this occurs over a very long period of time: decades. 01:41:20:16 So, brain cells are being destroyed, and until they lose a number of brain cells, they're not even aware that they're under this toxicity. 01:41:29:13 Uh, it's known in neurology that you have to lose about 90% of the neurons in a particular area of the brain before you develop symptoms. 01:41:38:01 So, you - by the time like dementia or lost 90% of the neurons in that part of the brain, and that's what's very important. 01:41:48:17 DR. RUSSELL connected to the growth 01:41:54:16 And glutamate, spreads problem is, no one's telling cancer patients they need to food Beautiful Truth 108 01:42:20:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett never did eat any of those chips. 01:42:22:27 He wants all the brain cells he has. 01:42:25:03 The number of food products that contain MSG, it as such, is now almost infinite. 01:42:31:10 The only way to avoid this is to buy organic products and whole foods. 01:42:35:17 What the boy also was that this was confirmation of Gerson's 80 years earlier. 01:42:4 1:25 order to provide a balanced report on the subject of processed foods, the boy then flew from Jackson, Mississippi to Omaha, Nebraska, with the hopes of interviewing a ConAgra Foods public a thought there was reason to be optimistic. 01:43:00:12 But he was wrong. 01:43:01:28 No one facility would speak. STEVE me, when considering that they are feeding us - or some of us - every day. 01:43:23:19 It reminded me of facilities in military's HAARP project that questions about weather, or my experiences in trying to get interviews with oil companies that turned me down flat. 01:43:40:01 The Native people of the North and their concerns are low priority. 01:43:43:22 The boy tried with no not lost, however. 01:43:52:14 We went to Omaha's Mayberry Park, where Garrett found great delight once more. 01:44:06:22 HOWARD STRAUS: We have to go back to Hippocrates. 01:44: 09:00 He said, first of all, \"Do 01:44:10:27 Well, every single drug does harm. 01:44:14:20 Then he also said, \"Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.\" 01:44:20:16 That's very important, because food will nourish you and heal you. 01:44:26:00 It's natural materials, which your body knows how to utilize. 01:44:29:24 Your body has evolved over millions of years to use, whereas these huge, incredibly profitable companies all over the world are damaging, liver toxic, and cause dise ase. 01:44:42:24 So, how can they really be considered a medicine if they're causing disease? we food manufacturers, then maybe we could speak to a food Engineer. 01:44:54:00 Meet Carol Hoernlein. The Beautiful Truth 109 01:44:5 5:13 We met her at the St. Louis, Missouri airport, and we're driving her to a radio interview. 01:45:00:06 Along the drive, there was plenty of time for sight -seeing. 01:45:03:09 Garrett, in particular, now had time to digest a lot of information. 01:45:07:21 He overheard much of the conversation going on in the front seat about another food additive that made him remember. 01:45:13:26 DR. JOHN OLNEY: In 1974, I petitioned the commissioner of FDA about some evidence I had found pertaining to aspartame causing, uh, brain the former head of G.D. Searle, Donald Rumsfeld, forced it into the food market anyway. 01:45:34:01 As a highly -paid and highly -respected food engineer, Carol was right in line to work with this dangerous substance. 01:45:39:26 It wasn't long before she was riddled her gland continues to have health problems. 01:45:47:25 Carol will never be the same again. 01:45:49:29 She no longer wants to work as a food engineer, because, quote, \"I tobacco story, because at le ast you can choose not to smoke. 01:46:04:15 Food, you have no choice. 01:46:07:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: We were now at the radio station where Carol would have a chance to tell the world her story, and what food additives like MSG and aspartame do to any unfor tunate organism that comes in contact with it. 01:46:20:03 This radio program, The Power Hour, can be heard around the world on short wave radio or the Internet every day of the week in rebroadcasts or broadcasts. 01:46:28:15 MALE RADIO going expert MSG and what she has been doing is putting together information that's gonna be pretty It's That's a result of using MSG, but she didn' t really use it; it was done to her. 01:46:55:24 And you were using it by the shovels, weren't you? The of a barrel? 01:47:04:26 CAROL HOERNLEIN: I've had many, many, um, problems over the years. 01:47:07:12 JOYCE RILEY: What about these tabs? 01:47:08:12 You know, the tab drugs? 01:47:09:09 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Yes, um, the quick dissolve, the Listerine? 01:47:12:12 JOYCE RILEY: The um, the Listerine quick dissolve things, those aspartame in them as well. 01:47:17:10 JOYCE RILEY: Wow. So, if you all have any qu estions, this is the website to go to. 01:47:20:27 Now, we linked this years ago, I think, to our website, and then now I have the pleasure of meeting you and right here in our studios, so this is really cool. 01:47:29:14 This is really great. 01:47:30:0 7 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Oh yeah, I really appreciated that. 01:47:31:23 When I saw that on the web, I was so excited that you - you know, you had found it, and, uh... 01:47:36:19 JOYCE RILEY: Oh. You've done a - ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce yo u today to our committee of one, Carol Hoernlein. 01:47:42:28 Thank you very much, Carol, for joining us on the Power Hour today. 01:47:45:17 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Oh. Thank you so much. 01:47:46:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: If The Power Hour show allows people like C arol to speak out on such topics, they have to creative about staying on the air. 01:47:53:15 Advertisers that support the mainstream media do so because they are able to tout pharmaceuticals, processed foods and the Power Hour products, food flavorings, books and DVD's. STEVE KROSCHEL: program, I watched co -host Dave vonKleist relaxing with Garrett in Okay. Now. 01:48:24:26 Okay. 01:48:26:27 STEVE KROSCHEL: Host Joyce Riley knew Charlotte Gerson and was familiar with the Gerson therapy. 01:48:31:15 Joyce's background is in the military as a nurse, and the Gulf War affected her with Gulf an Truth 111 produced a startling film called Beyond Treason , which documented with has a half of 4\u00bd billion years, and has now contaminated regions of the Middle East forever. 01:49:30:25 STEVE KROSCHEL: Joyce explained the Golf JOYCE RILEY: War illness is something that is a combination of a lot of toxins, and I couldn't figure out why I was sick, because I only flew from Alaska to Cuba during the time that I was a flight nurse. 01:49:45:16 But I became ill. 01:49:46:21 I did have the vaccines. 01:49:48:05 A lot of the troops did have the oil well fire exposure, they had chemicals, biologicals, vaccines, everything involved. 01:49:54:22 What we do know now is that they were ful l of toxins. 01:49:58:24 I was a nurse for about 35 years, and during that time, I'd done everything from electro -convulsive therapy, which is shock therapy, I had done. 01:50:07:07 I had been a chemo nurse, I was a director of nursing. 01:50:10:18 I was a nurse in a heart, lung, liver, kidney transplant unit, and I never appreciated food at all. 01:50:14:28 I never appreciated what it was for. 01:50:16:29 And then I became ill after the Gulf War, and it was amazing to me that nothing in medicine could make me better, nothing. 01:50:24:11 So, I had to start looking to alternative and integrative medicine. 01:50:28:16 Gulf war veterans were 01:50:31:17 Thousands, thousands of them were becoming ill. 01:50:34:13 And we had no place to turn to. 01:50:37:03 We found out that there was some Gulf War veterans that had been helped by eating raw foods, vegetables, fruits, and doing juicing. 01:50:43:29 And I became aware of that. 01:50:46:10 But it wasn't until later that I became aware of what I think has really been a pivotal point in my life, which was going to the Charlotte Gerson Restoration Center in San Diego. 01:50:56:10 And that's what really made me understand the importance of what we eat and drink. 01:51: 00:17 STEVE KROSCHEL: When all this talk about vaccines came up, Garrett shared his own feelings about vaccines that are given to infants and school -age children. 01:51:08:04 There was a 90% reduction in diseases before the vaccines were even introduced, as graphs clearly The 01:51:21:24 And for that reason and awareness, the boy has a clear position on the subject. HOWARD are literally lethal. 01:51:42:06 STEVE KROSCHEL: It was here in San Francisco that the boy had the good fortune to meet the Executive Director of the Center for Food Safety, Andrew Kimbrell. 01:51:51:26 The Center fo r Food Safety is a national nonprofit organization working to protect consumers and the environment from the hazards of harmful food production technologies, and promote organic and other forms of sustainable agriculture. 01:52:07:08 ANDREW KIMBRELL: One of the greatest misconceptions we have about genetically engineered foods is that genie is out of the bottle. 01:52:11:19 You know, you hear all the time that 60% or 70% of foods got genetically modified ingredients in it. 01:52:17:09 Not true; None of your fruits, none of your vegetables, you know, your meat, your fish, most of your dairy products a re completely free of genetically engineered ingredients. 01:52:32:22 As a four engineered crops: that's, that, really, genetically engineered food is one of the great failures of modern agriculture that's been r ejected around the world, and not only can we stop it, we are stopping it. 01:52:54:18 ANDREW KIMBRELL: There are five companies that are behind GMO's. 01:52:57:00 You have Monsanto, Dupont, Behr, Segenta, and Dow. 01:53:03:04 Those are the big five com panies behind genetically engineered foods. 01:53:06:04 And they all share one thing in common: they're not agriculture companies, they're chemical companies. 01:53:11:22 And a reason for that. 01:53:13:09 Genetic engineering today means only on e thing - not all the stuff that's been advertised, all the myths about more food, more nutritious food, tastier food - all nonsense science fiction. The Beautiful Truth 113 01:53:22:00 These chemical companies have engineered these crops so they can withstand more and more of t heir herbicides and pesticides. 01:53:27:19 And they - KIMBRELL: surprised that Monsanto did not want to interview for this f ilm. 01:53:35:29 Monsanto has developed the technology, which has one purpose and one purpose alone, which is they can sell more of their herbicides. 01:53:44:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett had some homework completed on this topic, which he found notable an d disturbing. 01:54:09:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: \"Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe safety of biotech food, our interest is in selling as much as possible. Assuring its safety is the FDA's job.\" 01:54:20:13 But Garrett found this disturbing and confusin g. 01:54:23:02 In a recently published book, he read another statement. 01:54:26:27 GARRETT: \"Ultimately, it is safety.\" 01:54:31:24 BETH HARRISON: Uh, so, really it's up to the good nature of the biotec h companies to provide studies to the government. 01:54:39:23 But mostly this is an unregulated industry, and this is our food. 01:54:44:04 ANDREW KIMBRELL: One of the great questions people ask engineered foods toxi the FDA gave us an answer. 01:54:51:15 The Food and Drug Administration has given us the answer. 01:54:53:10 In the '80s and '90s, they looked at these foods and said, \"Yes, the process of genetic engineering can take a nontoxic food and it toxic.\" 01:55:00:27 It can create new allergens. 01:55:02:24 It can lower nutrition in foods. 01:55:04:09 It can lower our immune response. 01:55:06:15 And, in certain cases, we've even foods have the potential to create cancer, certain of the - this technology. 01:55:12:05 So, the answer is in on whether GMO foods are lethal or toxic. 01:55:16:21 Yes, the very process can make a safe food and turn it into a toxic food, and potentially a lethal food. 01:55:22:25 ANDREW KIMBREL L: The objective Monsanto is clear. 01:55:24:20 Monsanto has become the largest seed company in the world. 01:55:28:07 Monsanto is in the process of buying up all the seeds in the world, which they then want to patent and control, so that farmers will not be able to save those seeds. 01:55:37:16 And then when they genetically engineer those seeds, and they want to put something called Terminator technology in those seeds. The Beautiful Truth 114 01:55:42:23 And this has those seeds create suicide after one growing season, s o that farmers cannot save those seeds. 01:55:48:18 So, what Monsanto's really after is controlling all the seeds of the Earth, and making sure that the farmers of the Earth cannot save those seeds. 01:55:57:11 This becomes extremely important when you r ealize that 80% of all the farmers of the world depend on seed saving for their survival. 01:56:06:00 So, if Monsanto's able - either through patenting or through this terminator technology - to destroy their ability to save seeds, the result will be mass starvation. 01:56:16:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett was surprised to are of institutions in t he U.S. alone that strive to declare the good news of sustainable agriculture. 01:56:31:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Paul Hepperly demonstrated to us through many seed and field trial studies the amazing ways in which plants thrive and health. 01:56:53:03 Dr. Gerson that the soil is our ex ternal metabolism. 01:56:57:08 It must be free of sprays and poisons or the body cannot heal. 01:57:11:16 STEVE KROSCHEL: With chemical agriculture, the water that comes out of your tap may contain much more than fluoride and chlorine. 01:57:21:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: there's another treatment process that could still threaten your health. 01:57:26:01 ANDREW KIMBRELL: We have found with the irradiation of food is it does not just kill the bacteria, which is what it is used for, but actually molecula rly changes the food. creates something in food called \"free radicals.\" 01:57:38:02 These are novel molecular elements in the food that have never been there before. 01:57:42:03 Uh, for example, in normal foods we have seen the creation o f benzene, which is a known carcinogen. 01:57:48:27 We have seen a number of other toxic elements in these food created because irradiation that fundamentally that KIMBRELL: What we, I think, now understood about our food crisis is it's not just a crisis of losing farms, it's not just an environmental crisis. 01:58:03:23 It's nutrition crisis. The Truth It's also crisis. 01:58:07:08 Every decision each of us makes about the food that we buy, the food that we eat, the food that we grow changes our farm system, changes the fate of the 10 billion animals used each year, and so cruelly treated each year in our food system. 01:58:20:28 So, we have an ethical responsibility to eat well. 01:58:24:22 ANDREW KIMBRELL: The beautiful truth is that people around the world are saying, \"No,\" 01:58:34:10 They're saying, \"Yes,\" to food that is STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett thought that one way to stop some of this is by the way we vote, if indeed you can trust the voting machines to work right. 01:58:58:19 STEVE KROSCHEL: How could a man who was curing cancer and chronic disease over 80 years ago be so misunderstood? 01:59:04:19 It was now even within reach for this 15 -year-old boy to understand. 01:59:08:27 Is it at this point a race against time to consider the gift Gerson offered the world so long ago, before we exceed the tipping point merely of our trave l, Garrett noted an article in the paper about obesity. 01:59:32:03 After what he had learned, it wasn't a bit surprising. 01:59:35:11 With all these chemicals and craving for more chemicals and more refined foods and sugar, we are bound to be obese and die that way. 02:00:00:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: The Ohio Valley is the casket -making capital of the world. 02:00:03:28 Naturally, the boy what eventually dead company, this family -owned business is experiencing a which root canals, to name a few. 02:00:27:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Even the standard -size casket is an wider than it used to be. 02:01:22:05 KEITH DAVIS: Most people won't get in one because they're afraid to do that. quit e nice for the cabin up in Alaska in the summer. The Beautiful Truth 116 02:01:34:13 You - you can close the lid, and you wouldn't get any light, and you could sleep better. 02:01:45:19 KEITH DAVIS: Stick your fingers out. 02:01:54:16 Most of the people are not taller, but the y're wider and deeper. 02:01:58:24 One of the issues we have with oversized, uh - obesity and oversized people, is that they're very wide, and they're also very much thicker, or deeper. 02:02:09:10 So, this problem. 02:02:12:27 Also, when we're, uh - when they ask for a cremation - and many times they cannot do the cremation because the doors on the retort aren't big enough. 02:02:21:26 Also, if they can do that, they have to be very careful of how they pro cess the body in the retort to prevent the retort from catching on fire, because of all the excess body fluids that may catch on fire, and also cause the retort to burn down. 02:02:35:04 There have been several incidences where the fluids of the body caug ht on fire and, uh, caused the retort to burn down. 02:02:41:21 This happened in Columbus and in Indianapolis. 02:02:50:20 STEVE KROSCHEL: With all this cross country travel, we had to stop. 02:03:07:12 It was the home of Garrett's maternal grandmother. 02:03:13:14 Garrett's mother was killed in a freak accident one year and eight months ago. 02:03:29:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: All living things have a distinctive energy field around them that can be measured, and even photographed. 02:03:35:00 Garrett rememb ered before he left on this experiment with an aerospace engineer named Christopher Wodtke. 02:03:41:27 In this take, demonstrated was comparison between organic baby is on the left. 02:03:51:24 The uncooked is on the right. 02:03:54:10 The startling in carrot steamed 10 minutes. 02:04:03:27 What this means is that pasteurized food is dead. 02:04:07:19 Garrett held a funeral for the latest victim, the almond. 02:04:21:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: We then tried the experiment with a piece of inorganic apple and a piece of organic apple. 02:04:27:20 The results were more subt le, but the apple piece on the right is 02:04:33:02 volts and a broad range of frequencies to resonate w ith the test objects, capturing their patterns for analysis, whether living or nonliving. 02:05:11:28 The boy found the results consistent and fascinating, an area of study that needs a closer look. 02:05:26:19 CHRISTOPHER WODTKE: Science is when you can put numbers to things. 02:05:30:12 When you can put a measurement on things, you can create a science around it. 02:05:35:19 Kirlian photography is the iridology of the future where we can see markers in the aura that's around people's bodies, and these markers indicate where their health is deficient and where their health is fine. 02:05:58:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: All of the homework that Garrett did was finally coming together. 02:06:05:14 His study of the Gerson therapy was now close to completion. 02:06 :09:26 The Gerson therapy is no secret - never has been - and it works. 02:06:13:29 It is simple, but requires compliance enemas. 02:06:32:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Gerson gave an example of 50 recovered patients in his original book in the late 1950's that was representative of thousands of recoveries that that time. 02:06:42:07 All the patients were diagnosed w ith extremely detailed records at leading medical centers around the country. 02:06:48:11 During and after the treatment, the medical records from independent medical centers bear out the results, and the results bear out a beautiful truth. 02:07:02:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Gerson cured his good friend Dr. Albert Schweitzer of adult onset diabetes, and then his wife of lung tuberculosis, and then his daughter of a rare skin disease. 02:07:11:25 It is something Schweitzer would never forget, and exchanged letters up in 1959. 02:07:20:12 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett thought the only reason that could explain why the general public has never heard about this therapy is because of this. 02:07:30:00 The boy is certain that many of the famous a nd talented would have changed history and culture if they could have only known. 02:07:37:03 CHARLOTTE GERSON: Garrett, on the question of what does the pancreas do, essentially the job of the pancreas is to digest food. 02:07:44:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: The pancreas has a key role to play in the Gerson therapy, and in this boy's simple graphic, it is clear the human intestinal track is longer than that of the carnivore. The Beautiful Truth 118 02:07:54:15 The digestion in a human becomes quite compromised if he starts to eat animal protein, as well the digestive tract. 02:08:06:08 CHARLOTTE GERSON: But the pancreas has one additional, very important job, and that is to protect the body from, uh, malignant cells. 02:08:15:29 The pancreas recognizes malign ant cells if they develop, and digests and kills them, and gets rid of them. 02:08:24:16 When you overload the pancreas, as most Americans do, with excess animal protein foods, all the jobs, all the ability of the pancreas is used up just trying to digest and get rid of all this animal product, and there's nothing left to protect you from the, uh, malignant 02:08:47:06 The immune system is paralyzed. 02:08:50:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: Then the question was posed to Howard by the Slovenian guest the caffeine in the coffee enema was absorbed by the hemorrhoidal vein, which is wrapped around your descending colon. 02:09:06:00 That is a vei n; it's a drainage system, not a distribution system, like an artery. 02:09:10:29 So that - that's part of the portal venous system, which then brings the caffeine the caffeine, but also some of the other - other, to produce glutathione S -transferase enzyme. 02:09:46:23 Uh, of course, pharmaceutical have wanted produce something that would simulate glutathione could clean say, that.\" The Beautiful 02:10:06:24 enema is prepared with three tablespoons fine ground organic coffee, then it is simmered for 15 minutes. 02:10:14:12 It is then poured through a filter into a one quart container. 02:10:18:00 Distilled water is also added to restore it to a quart. 02:10:21:10 Then it is poured into an enema bucket. 02:10:25:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: Once the coffee has drained into the patient, the patient lies on his right side, knees drawn up for approximately 10 to 13 minutes, and then evacuates. 02:10:36:26 But in order for the bo y to truly be impacted on a personal level, he needed to meet cancer patients to believe it for himself. 02:10:44:23 No more pictures, no more books. 02:10:47:13 Garrett wanted to go to Mexico. 02:11:15:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: The boy was surprised at how pl easant the surroundings were, and how happy the cancer patients seemed. 02:11:21:11 They were here from all over the world. 02:11:23:24 Garrett ate with them and listened to their stories. 02:11:26:24 One of the clinic's doctors shared with Garrett a pe rsonal experience about working on a movie set as a crew doctor on the Hollywood movie James Cameron made called Titanic , which shot in Mexico. 02:11:42:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: One of the patients from New Zealand was eager to visit with Garrett. 02:11:46:14 GARRETT: So, how long have you been here? 02:11:48:13 FEMALE PATIENT: Three weeks today. 02:11:50:15 Um, I came here straight from the Mayo clinic in Florida. 02:11:54:18 And I've got melanoma in my bones, spine, leg, liver, lungs and lumps. 02:12:03:07 Since I've been inside I feel hugely different: much stronger, physically, and I've lost the nausea. 02:12:13:00 I've had, uh it's a little bit of a roller coaster. 02:12:16:04 You get some reactions while check diagnostically, because it's only three weeks, but within myself, I feel 100% better than when I came. 02:12:26:20 Um, Garrett, there was one person when I first came here who wasn't doing so well with the therapy. 02:12:32:22 And he started off doing 50% of it, um, and by the time he left, he was doing very little. 02:12:39:20 I would recommend anyone who wanted to do this to do therapy, otherwise it really doesn't work. 02:12:44:24 That's the ene mas, the diet, 02:12:48:17 And then it really works. 02:12:51:17 FEMALE PATIENT: So, I came here from, uh, the Mayo clinic, and I just finished doing radiation. The Beautiful Truth 120 02:12:57:04 They told me that I had four to six months to live if I didn't do chemo. 02:13:01:15 And if I did chemo, I'd have six to eight months to live, with what I had. 02:13:05:22 If I had really good chemo - that's like top of the line - and I responded, I might have a year. 02:13:10:16 So, looking at those options, I decided to look elsewhere. 02:13:14:10 My sister flew over to meet me, and she was reading Angola's book about his recovery from cancer. 02:13:20:19 He had bone cancer, where he was given two weeks to live. 02:13:24:17 And after, um, trying the Gerson therapy f or several months and then adapting it, um, he's now still alive and is got the Angola Foundation in Australia. 02:13:35:09 I trust it, actually, with my life; that's why I'm here. 02:13:37:21 DOCTOR: In talking to Mrs. Gerson and talking... 02:13:39:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: And then Howard and Garrett spoke with one of the clinic's doctors. 02:13:42:20 DOCTOR: ...both cases that we have -- 02:13:43:28 HOWARD STRAUS: And what do you see? 02:13:45:00 What do you see in the first few days? 02:13:47:01 DOCTOR: In the first few days, with doing enemas, I started here, the first that went, blood pressure. 02:13:57:06 Blood pressure in the first week disappears. 02:13:59:15 Good you know, there's more here enema, and detox, and organic diet, and juices. 02:14:08:06 They start to see the changes, and as I start to believe in what they hope they're (words unclear). 02:14:13:18 And their way o f life. 02:14:18:23 HOWARD STRAUS: And you, as a physician, must satisfaction. DOCTOR: It excites me. 02:14:23:27 Unbelievable to see changes in the blood work, in the X -rays. 02:14:27:28 Something that I can actually touch, feel, because I see these patients every day. 02:14:33:20 STEVE KROSCHEL: From Tijuana, Garrett travels south to meet a cancer patient that was recovering against all odds, at home with the Gerson therapy. 02:14:43:00 In the mountains outside San Cristob al de las Casas, Howard Straus guided Garrett to meet this patient, who is the same age as Garrett. 02:14:52:05 Her name is Lupita. The Beautiful Truth 121 02:15:12:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: Lu pita a Garrett that anything possible one simply has faith. 02:15:35:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: For Lupita, fresh 02:15:42:12 truly organic produce in the States is harder to come by. 02:16:03:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: The laboratory tests on the patients are extensive and carefully watched. 02:16:07:08 Most patients only stay at the clinic one to three weeks, and then go home to re cover. 02:16:11:26 One study on the Gerson therapy found a 100% success rate with melanoma, stage one and two. 02:16:18:19 80%, and stage four, 39% success For terminal patients of any cancer that orthodox medicine had given up on, 39% still recover, and that includes pancreas cancer, which has conventional medicine. 02:16:37:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: The Gerson institute in San Diego has extensive files of case histories for anyone to see. 02:16:4 5:12 ISSA KHALAF: At 12 months after, uh, the diagnosis of I was cancer -free within 12 months. 02:16:52:10 And, uh, that was proven by the MRI and other imaging tests that I had, and which found, amazingly, that the cancer was completely gone. 02:17:02:20 From my sacrum, from my pelvis, from my liver and from the prostate. 02:17:08:18 32 months after diagnosis, I did yet another MRI, a second MRI, and that reconfirmed that the cancer was completely gone from my body, in all areas of my body. 02:17:20:24 ISSA KHALAF: And if anyone doubts this, uh, I have all the medical records to prove it. 02:17:25:03 I brought all the medical records with me, from the doctor's reports to the scans to the imagings, and they it without, without, b eyond a doubt. 02:17:34:29 It's Garrett footage I had taken almost five years ago of a patient that was given a death sentence by stage orthodox here she therapy in a last ditch effort. 02:18:28:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: And now, five years later, Garrett was looking at the results. 02:18:35:14 Was he reading her obituary? 02:18:38:19 This was her story. 02:18:43:06 WOMAN: He leaves the room and goes, you know, down the hall for a minute. 02:18:48:12 And he comes back in the door, and he crosses his han ds across his chest, and just in astonishment, he looks at me and he says, \"You're the only patient we have seen that has diagnosis.\" 02:19:02:15 He said, \"This is unheard of.\" 02:19:05:08 And, um, so I told him that if he ever got sick to give me a call. 02:19:13:06 And I would help him. 02:19:14:25 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett wanted to push this further, and so he asked this patient to go back to the Mayo clinic to get a statement from her diagnostic doctor that the Gerson therapy cured her. 02:19:26:05 The Mayo clinic went into a panic mode, because the doctor did want to appear on camera, but he was cut off. 02:19:33:03 It became a waiting game. 02:19:34:29 WOMAN: He would have much a big diffe rence for the treatment of cancer and the environment. 02:19:40:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: As a result, the doctor is quitting the Mayo clinic to work without such restrictive boundaries. 02:19:46:12 But there are many others. 02:19:48:20 WOMAN: In 1986, I was diagnosed with pancreas cancer, which spread 02:19:56:21 The doctors told me I had three months to live, to go home, get my finances in order, and prepare to die. 02:20:08:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: She did the Ge rson therapy over 20 years ago. 02:20:12:01 Garrett remembered where he started with his home school lesson. 02:20:14:29 It all came back to him quite DR. DEAN EDELL: evidence that been uh, Gerson therapy. 02:20:31:07 DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: It's not right from any aspect at all. DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: No, 'course not, they won't even release their records. The Beautiful Truth 123 02:20:39:24 DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: I don't believe that there's any proof that the Gerson therapy works. 02:20:44:22 In other words, Charlotte Gerson was lying. CHARLOTTE GERSON: There are laws against healing cancer. 02:20:54:03 The doctor is not allowed to try anything else. 02:20:56:28 He must use only those treatments that have already proven to be failures. 02:21:02:14 Imagine what we could do if this could be accepted. 02:21:07:01 BOB: What I'd like to see is so proof, some good scientific proof. cancer industry thrives and continues to persuade people that we are still searching for a cure. 02:21:26:00 The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute wouldn't even return our calls. 02:21:32:12 STEVE KROSCHEL: Before Garrett returned to Alaska, there was one more person he wanted to meet. 02:21:37:11 His na me is Jay Kordich. 02:21:39:17 Known by millions as The Garrett, you know I've been doing this now since 1948, ever since I had c ancer of the urinary bladder. 02:21:54:22 You know, uh, when I think back, I just finished playing football for the University of Southern California, and, uh, I was drafted by Curly Lambeau and the Green pr oblem started. 02:22:07:16 I started to pass blood, and I found out it was - I had a tumor in my urinary bladder, and I had remembered a class that I had on one of my physiology classes - human anatomy classes - and I had inadvertently read about Dr. Max Gerson treating Dr. Albert Schweitzer, you know. 02:22:25:22 And I figured, my God, after I found out I had cancer of the bladder, I figured if this treatment was good enough for Dr. Albert Schweitzer, it's gotta be good enough for me. 02:22:37:17 JAY KO RDICH: Never believe that much juice would come out of this. 02:22:41:10 JAY KORDICH: This - this is the juice that saved my life when I had cancer of the bladder. 02:22:49:03 The Gerson treatment: carrot of t hat, I'm here. 02:22:57:06 All the drinks that I made and I continue even today, and this has been how long? 02:23:03:02 Wow. 1948. The Beautiful Truth 124 02:23:05:12 My of advice to you, bring the power of plants your 02:23:10:18 There's like trillion cells. 02:23:58:08 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett was now six miles from home. 02:24:01:03 His home school lesson was officially over. 02:24:04:03 The memories of the trip still glowed red hot in his mind. 02:24:08:06 Specifically, how could he possibly forget a woman who carries on her father's work relentlessly, against all opposition, who carries the torch of a way of life that is health care, not some government agency's plan, hatched with a collection of drug com panies? 02:24:48:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: The boy does believe in hope. 02:24:50:09 He believes he has a future. 02:24:52:19 into collective solutions. 02:24:58:20 After all, this is our only home, and we are rational human beings. 02:25:45:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett his neighbor, 02:26:56:13 STEVE KROSCHEL: Our ot her neighbor, Bob, the one that milks the goats and was quite skeptical, was really liking what he was hearing. was his wife, up until... 02:27:05:06 GARRETT: Okay, so here you want to add three tablespoons of coffee into your boiling water. 02:27:11:00 Then you want to let it simmer after, for 12 minutes. 02:27:14:27 And, uh, pour it in a quart jar and add water so it, um, ends up being a quart. 02:27:20:28 Um, then you connect the tube to your arse, and then you let the coffee drai n into your arse. 02:27:28:27 Then, uh, you let it sit for 12 minutes, and then you release it into the bathroom toilet. 02:28:07:09 we're ready or not, someday it will come to an end. 02:28:15:09 Ther e will be no more sunrises, no minutes, hours or days. 02:28:20:20 All the things you collected, whether treasured or forgotten, will pass to someone else. 02:28:27:06 Your wealth, fame and temporal power will shrivel to irrelevance. 02:28:32:25 It will not matter ambitions, and do lists will expire. The Beautiful 125 02:28:51:15 The wins and losses that once seeme d so important will fade away. 02:28:56:18 It won't matter where you came from, or on what side of the tracks you lived at the end. 02:29:02:18 It won't matter if you're beautiful or brilliant. 02:29:05:23 Even your gender and skin color will be irrelev ant. 02:29:09:29 So, what will matter? 02:29:11:27 How will the value of your days be measured? 02:29:15:03 What will matter is not what you bought but what you built, not what you got but what you gave. 02:29:22:16 What will matter is not your success but your significance. 02:29:27:10 What will matter is not what you learned but what you taught. 02:29:31:24 What will matter is every act of courage or sacrifice emulate your examp le. 02:29:42:19 What will matter is not your competence but your character. 02:29:47:03 What will matter is not how many people you knew, but how many will feel a lasting loss when you're gone. 02:29:54:04 What will matter is not your memories but the m emories that live in those who loved you. 02:30:05:08 A life lived that matters is not of circumstance but of choice. 02:31:38:20 CREDITS The Beautiful Truth 126 ndix II The Beautiful Truth 127 THE BEAUTIFUL TRUTH - TRANSLATION INTO SPANISH 01:00:00:00 INICIO DEL PROGRAMA 01:00:03:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: La m\u00e1s densa oscuridad puede ser traspasada por penetrantes rayos de luz . 01:00:09:02 Y a trav\u00e9s de una delicada arteria, se dan paso las finitas extensiones del milagro llamado \"vida\". 01:00:18:21 La Tierra: Ha existido por mucho tiempo. 01:00:24:10 La luz ha ba\u00f1ado gentilmente esta hermosa y compleja membrana fielmente. 01:00:31:27 STEVE KROSCHEL: La humanidad es la \u00fanica forma de vida que se detiene a observar detenidamente nuestro \u00fanico hogar. 01:00:39:20 Nuestra inteligencia nos ha l levado hasta aqu\u00ed. 01:00:42:08 Y tambi\u00e9n nos ha llevado m\u00e1s cerca de otro mundo... dentro de nosotros. 01:00:47:00 Y dentro de este universo, ir\u00f3nicamente, est\u00e1 el plan para nuestro futuro. 01:00:53:01 STEVE KROSCHEL: C\u00e1ncer: Es un bio -c\u00f3digo con fallas . 01:00:56:20 Se deleita con lo que hacemos para alimentarlo. 01:00:59:21 El men\u00fa que servimos a estas criaturas se vuelve cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s extenso. 01:01:05:08 Excepto que un ser humano encontr\u00f3 la forma de cerrar las puertas de la despensa hace mucho tiem po, en 1928. 01:01:16:19 Esta es su historia. 01:01:25:09 El famoso naturalista John Muir escribi\u00f3 una vez: \"Si uno hala de una simple hebra de la naturaleza, descubrir\u00e1s que est\u00e1 conectada con todo lo dem\u00e1s\". 01:01:33:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: Este joven de 1 5 a\u00f1os llamado Garrett continuamente redescubre ese hecho desde diferentes puntos de vista. 01:01:40:01 El vive con su padre en una regi\u00f3n remota de Alaska, donde viajar en avioneta es algo casi rutinario. 01:01:46:04 Desde estas alturas, se puede observ ar f\u00e1cilmente la salud de los bosques, la vida silvestre e incluso el deshielo glaciar. 01:02:10:16 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett posee una aguda sensibilidad hacia la naturaleza. 01:02:13:20 Sus ojos ya han visto la crudeza de la naturaleza, teniendo as\u00ed las respuestas a muchas preguntas incluso antes de poder leer sobre ellas en libros. 01:02:32:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: Desde que \u00e9l ten\u00eda uso de raz\u00f3n, su familia ha trabajado con animales salvajes hu\u00e9rfanos, por lo que su conocimiento sobre biolog\u00eda era pr\u00e1ctico en eso tambi\u00e9n. 01:02:42:06 Gracias en parte a un libro especial escrito por un Dr. Max Gerson. The Beautiful Truth 128 01:02:47:15 \u00c9l entendi\u00f3 la importancia de alimentar a un cachorro, como es el caso de este puercoesp\u00edn, con la mezcla exacta de alimentos, o esa criatura mori r\u00eda r\u00e1pidamente, sobre todo en sus primeros d\u00edas de vida. 01:03:10:17 STEVE KROSCHEL: Con visitas regulares a nuestro vecino, Bob, conseguimos esta leche de cabra sin pasteurizar. 01:03:15:22 Ninguna tienda podr\u00eda venderla legalmente. 01:03:18:22 La esp osa de Bob, Margaret, se recupera de un c\u00e1ncer de mama. 01:03:25:08 Pero recientemente ella escuch\u00f3 a Garrett hablar sobre el Dr. Gerson, y enseguida se corri\u00f3 la voz en la comunidad sobre esta terapia Gerson. 01:03:33:22 Entre las personas que quedaron profunda y positivamente impactadas estuvieron el alcalde, el electricista local, el banquero, el hombre del Museo Hammer. 01:03:48:14 Tambi\u00e9n se sum\u00f3 el apicultor quien observ\u00f3 v\u00ednculos de la terapia Gerson con la salud y productividad de sus abejas. 01:03:56:13 Adem\u00e1s estaban el artista, los empleados de la tienda org\u00e1nica, y luego se obtuvo un video de Gerson. 01:04:06:01 CHARLOTTE GERSON: Existen leyes en contra de la curaci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer. 01:04:08:09 A los m\u00e9dicos no se les permite que intenten nada m\u00e1s. 01:04:11:05 Ellos deben aplicar s\u00f3lo esos tratamientos que se ha demostrado que no funcionan. 01:04:16:20 Imag\u00ednense lo que podr\u00edamos hacer si esto pudiera ser aceptado. 01:04:20:07 Pero hay leyes en contra de esto; no te permiten curarte. 01:04:23 :01 Es que hay mucho dinero por ganarse con la venta de f\u00e1rmacos. 01:04:25:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: Para el vecino diab\u00e9tico de Garrett, John, este mensaje lleg\u00f3 demasiado tarde para salvar sus piernas. 01:04:30:20 Pero quiz\u00e1s Bob, el lechero, tiene el mejor comentario sobre la terapia de Gerson. 01:04:35:27 BOB: Lo que me gustar\u00eda es ver pruebas, buenas pruebas cient\u00edficas. 01:04:41:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando un crucero arrib\u00f3 al pueblo, muchos turistas quer\u00edan aprender sobre la vida animal que preocupaba a Garrett. 01:04:46:14 A \u00e9l le sorprend\u00eda lo poco que la mayor\u00eda de la gente sab\u00eda acerca de los animales salvajes y sus necesidades. 01:05:04:03 STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando la hija del Dr. Gerson, Charlotte, se enter\u00f3 de esta situaci\u00f3n, ella le envi\u00f3 un peque\u00f1 o obsequio a Garrett. 01:05:21:09 Era un nuevo libro escrito por Charlotte que detallaba c\u00f3mo funcionaba la terapia del Dr. Gerson. 01:05:27:06 Contiene argumentos f\u00e1ciles de entender sobre el c\u00e1ncer. The Beautiful Truth 129 01:05:30:17 El texto ser\u00eda buena lectura, incluso pa ra un chico de 15 a\u00f1os. 01:05:34:12 Los cap\u00edtulos eran profundos y parec\u00edan demasiado buenos para ser verdad. 01:05:38:02 Se presentaban argumentos que despertaban la curiosidad por aprender m\u00e1s. 01:05:47:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: Este momento estaba a punto d e convertirse en un nuevo cap\u00edtulo en la vida de Garrett. 01:05:51:25 Hasta el momento, leer un libro de principio a fin era algo inusual para \u00e9l. 01:05:55:26 Pero en este caso era diferente, debido en parte a lo que se trataba en el libro; era lo que \u00e9l observaba a diario, incluso al hacer las tareas m\u00e1s rutinarias. 01:06:05:23 Algo de lo que Garrett no se hab\u00eda dado cuenta completamente era de las implicaciones de la potencia y poder contenidos en la vegetaci\u00f3n. 01:06:29:29 STEVE KROSCHEL: Lo que pare c\u00eda un simple refrigerio extra\u00eddo del huerto, tendr\u00eda tremendas implicaciones a nivel mundial. 01:06:36:03 Si la terapia de Gerson fuera aceptada e implementada, podr\u00eda ayudar a cambiar la historia de la agricultura moderna de la humanidad, el suministro de alimentos, los sistemas de salud, la econom\u00eda, y por supuesto, el medio ambiente. 01:06:48:21 Luego Garrett aprendi\u00f3 una lecci\u00f3n sobre no ser apreciado cuando un d\u00eda su padre limpiaba la casa y arroj\u00f3 a la basura una pieza art\u00edstica hecha por el mismo Garrett. 01:06:56:28 Debido a su dise\u00f1o inusual, el recolector de basura la cogi\u00f3 con mucho cuidado y se la dio a la polic\u00eda local, quien la identific\u00f3 como una bomba, sin duda, un duro golpe a la creatividad de Garrett. 01:07:05:21 Luego otras situacion es golpearon al joven Garrett, por lo que sus notas sobresalientes bajaron. 01:07:11:07 Su padre decidi\u00f3 que Garrett ten\u00eda que continuar con su educaci\u00f3n en casa. 01:07:13:23 Su primera lecci\u00f3n de educaci\u00f3n en casa fue acerca del Dr. Gerson y... 01:07:17 :10 BOB: Me gustar\u00eda ver alguna prueba cient\u00edfica. 01:07:20:13 STEVE KROSCHEL: El chico no estaba seguro de c\u00f3mo lograr eso, pero para empezar, dedujo una analog\u00eda entre las minas de oro y la naturaleza humana. 01:07:32:04 Decidi\u00f3 que el mejor lugar par a empezar su investigaci\u00f3n era la biblioteca p\u00fablica. 01:07:36:15 No le tom\u00f3 mucho tiempo para encontrar varias fuentes independientes que confirmaban puntos importantes mencionados en el libro original cl\u00e1sico del Dr. Gerson. 01:07:46:11 En base a aquel las importantes pautas, los dudosos personajes que crearon la historia sobre el uso del fluoruro, fascinaron al chico. The Beautiful Truth 130 01:07:53:21 Busc\u00f3 m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n y as\u00ed aparecieron m\u00e1s irregularidades. 01:07:58:08 Luego Garrett comenz\u00f3 a armar un bosquejo general de lo que se necesitaba para confirmar exitosamente el Protocolo de Gerson. 01:08:06:07 Fue cuando las palabras sobre esperanza se escribieron que ped\u00ed que me involucraran para ayudar a documentar la integridad de la Terapia Gerson. 01:08:15:22 GARRETT: Primero fue Gerald Cox, quien trabaj\u00f3 para el Instituto Mellon de Investigaci\u00f3n Industrial. 01:08:20:23 El Instituto Mellon, por cierto, fue el principal defensor de la industria del asbesto. 01:08:25:26 Gerald Cox se interes\u00f3 en el fluoruro por recomen daci\u00f3n de Francis Frary, director de los laboratorios de aluminio de Alcoa. 01:08:35:02 Y luego vino un destacado cient\u00edfico en toxicolog\u00eda, el Dr. Hodge Harold. 01:08:39:22 Harold Hodge fue quien supervis\u00f3 las inyecciones de plutonio y de uranio en huma nos. 01:08:45:29 STEVE KROSCHEL: Harold Hodge estudi\u00f3 la cuestionada seguridad del fluoruro, pero debido a la presi\u00f3n conjunta de la Comisi\u00f3n At\u00f3mica y de la industria del aluminio, tuvo que decir que su uso era seguro. 01:08:55:12 GARRETT: Harold Hodge, junto con un grupo de cient\u00edficos, ayud\u00f3 a desarrollar la bomba at\u00f3mica. 01:08:59:25 Tambi\u00e9n estuvo el Dr. Robert Kehoe, quien trabaj\u00f3 para el Laboratorio Kettering. 01:09:04:24 All\u00e1 por los a\u00f1os 50, el Sr. Kehoe era promotor industrial de la Corporaci\u00f3 n Ethyl y en aquel tiempo afirmaba que el plomo en la gasolina era seguro. 01:09:14:20 Frank L. Seamans era el abogado de Alcoa y el jefe del Comit\u00e9 de Abogados del Fl\u00faor. 01:09:21:02 Y entonces hubo un experimento con perros de raza beagle, en el cual es tos perros ten\u00edan que respirar aire fluorado seis d\u00edas a la semana. 01:09:27:08 Como resultado, los perros sufrieron da\u00f1os terribles en sus pulmones y en su sistema linf\u00e1tico. 01:09:32:04 Esta informaci\u00f3n debi\u00f3 haber sido entregada a los m\u00e9dicos y cient\u00ed ficos, pero en su lugar fue entregada al Comit\u00e9 de Abogados del Fl\u00faor, y fue desaparecida. 01:09:39:29 Y luego apareci\u00f3 Edward Bernays, sobrino de Sigmund Freud, el mago de las relaciones p\u00fablicas. 01:09:45:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: Vender fluoruro para el sumi nistro de agua potable fue f\u00e1cil para Bernays. 01:09:48:21 \u00c9l usaba el lema \"Conf\u00eda en tu m\u00e9dico\". 01:09:51:06 Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy, incluso pastillas de fluoruro son suministradas a ni\u00f1os, gracias en parte a la necesidad de usar fluoruro para construir l a bomba at\u00f3mica. The Beautiful Truth 131 01:09:58:08 HOMBRE EN TELEVISION: Yo represento una milla de distancia en tu c\u00e1mara. 01:10:01:03 La parte superior, dos millas. 01:10:02:15 Vamos a cambiar a otra c\u00e1mara. 01:10:04:02 Voy a salir de aqu\u00ed. 01:10:05:18 VOZ MASCULINA: Tre s, dos, uno, cero. 01:10:13:00 La onda expansiva llegar\u00e1 al \u00e1rea del punto de control en aproximadamente medio minuto. 01:10:47:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: En documentos desclasificados del gobierno, la Comisi\u00f3n At\u00f3mica, con respecto al uso de fluoruro y al regis tro de seguridad cuestionable en la construcci\u00f3n de la bomba, dijo que la informaci\u00f3n que invitara o tendiera a alentar reclamos en contra de la Comisi\u00f3n At\u00f3mica o sus contratistas, deb\u00eda ser modificada o borrada en los art\u00edculos a ser publicados. 01:11:08 :21 Situaciones similares a las de esta historia se pueden encontrar en otras actuales... \u00bftel\u00e9fonos celulares? 01:11:13:27 Un fondo de $28 millones fue asignado al Dr. George Carlos en los a\u00f1os 90s para probar la seguridad en el uso de los celulares, pe ro lo que descubri\u00f3 fue lo contrario. 01:11:22:02 El no acept\u00f3 remuneraci\u00f3n alguna. 01:11:24:05 Las transmisiones de los tel\u00e9fonos celulares son todav\u00eda motivo de preocupaci\u00f3n en cuanto a c\u00f3mo afectan a los insectos. 01:11:29:17 GARRETT: \u00bfEnse\u00f1an esto e n las escuelas p\u00fablicas? 01:11:33:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero con respecto a la salud dental, la dieta y no el fluoruro es la que realmente desempe\u00f1a un papel trascendental. 01:11:38:03 Esto se torn\u00f3 evidente para Garrett cuando ayud\u00f3 en una operaci\u00f3n sencil la de su lobo domesticado. 01:11:43:12 Los dientes perfectos del lobo, libres de caries, confirmaron detalles mencionados en un libro de la biblioteca que \u00e9l reci\u00e9n hab\u00eda le\u00eddo. 01:11:52:06 Se llamaba Nutrici\u00f3n y Degeneraci\u00f3n F\u00edsica , escrito por un recon ocido dentista, el Dr. Weston Price. 01:12:02:21 El Dr. Price viaj\u00f3 por el mundo con su esposa en los a\u00f1os 1930s y visit\u00f3 culturas nativas que nunca hab\u00edan sido expuestas a la dieta de la civilizaci\u00f3n moderna de harina refinada, alimentos enlatados y az\u00fac ar. 01:12:13:07 Para su sorpresa, estas personas promediaban menos del 1% de caries dental. 01:12:17:16 Y el Dr. Price not\u00f3 algo m\u00e1s. 01:12:20:05 Ninguno de los integrantes de estas varias tribus y culturas practicaba ning\u00fan tipo de higiene dental. 01:12:24:18 Ni uno solo de estos habitantes hab\u00eda utilizado nunca un cepillo dental. The Beautiful Truth 132 01:12:28:11 Pero cuando los alimentos procesados se incluyeron en su dieta, aparecieron la caries dental y enfermedades, y ese fue el principio del final de los que eran rob ustos y fuertes. 01:12:41:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: El Dr. Price estudi\u00f3 animales con dietas inapropiadas. 01:12:44:12 El resultado fue terneros de dos cabezas y gatos deformes. 01:12:47:26 Tambi\u00e9n observ\u00f3 una conexi\u00f3n directa entre la formaci\u00f3n del cr\u00e1neo hum ano y la dieta. 01:12:58:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: Incluso en la actualidad, el tema del fluoruro sigue en discusi\u00f3n. 01:13:03:10 En Juneau, capital del estado de Alaska, conoc\u00ed al Director del \u00c1rea de Odontolog\u00eda de la ciudad. 01:13:09:23 DIRECTOR DEL AREA DE ODONTOLOGIA: Con respecto a la posici\u00f3n del estado de Alaska sobre la fluoraci\u00f3n del agua, el Ministerio de Salud y Servicios Sociales y la Divisi\u00f3n de Salud P\u00fablica apoyan la fluoraci\u00f3n del agua. 01:13:17:24 Pero en Alaska es una iniciativa local, y lo que ocurre en Juneau es por votaci\u00f3n local para reanudar la fluoraci\u00f3n del agua. 01:13:24:09 Es decir que aunque el Ministerio lo apoya, es realmente un asunto local, y yo tambi\u00e9n estoy involucrado con la Coalici\u00f3n de Ciudadanos para la Salud Dental, pero eso no est\u00e1 en mi capacidad como Director del \u00c1rea de Odontolog\u00eda. 01:13:36:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfCree usted que el fluoruro en el agua ayudar\u00e1 a prevenir la caries y dem\u00e1s? 01:13:40:24 \u00bfCu\u00e1l es su opini\u00f3n? 01:13:41:22 DIRECTOR DEL AREA DE ODONTOLOGIA: C reo que hay clara evidencia de los \u00faltimos 60 a\u00f1os de que el fluoruro s\u00ed reduce la caries dental. 01:13:47:06 STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero los \u00fanicos efectos del fluoruro en la caries dental que se han medido derivan de su aplicaci\u00f3n t\u00f3pica y no de beberlo. 01:13 :53:05 Garrett necesitaba ver los dos lados de la medicina. 01:13:56:02 \u00c9l despu\u00e9s vio convincentes escenas de los videos sobre Gerson que yo ya hab\u00eda recopilado. 01:14:00:14 DR. DEAN EDELL: B\u00e1sicamente, si te pones a pensar en lo que consiste la terapi a de Gerson, en realidad no esperar\u00edas que cure el c\u00e1ncer. 01:14:06:04 As\u00ed es que no, no creo que haya ninguna evidencia de que alguien alguna vez haya sido curado con la terapia de Gerson. 01:14:11:12 DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: No es buena de ninguna manera. 01:14:14:16 STEVE KROSCHEL: Bueno, \u00bfAlguna vez la terapia de Gerson ha curado alg\u00fan enfermo de c\u00e1ncer? 01:14:18:02 DR. WALLACE SAMPSON: Claro que no. 01:14:18:18 Ellos ni siquiera muestran sus archivos. 01:14:20:09 DR. STEPHEN BARRETT: No hay absolutam ente ninguna evidencia cient\u00edfica de que \u00e9l haya curado a alguien. The Beautiful Truth 133 01:14:25:00 Nunca he entrevistado a ning\u00fan paciente de Gerson. 01:14:28:07 Realmente no tiene sentido hacerlo. 01:14:29:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero yo s\u00ed he entrevistado pacientes, a m\u00e1s de un par. 01:14:32:16 Estos pacientes se hab\u00edan recuperado de todo tipo de c\u00e1ncer. 01:14:35:21 Y, en muchos de ellos, era terminal. 01:14:37:18 La medicina ortodoxa los hab\u00eda abandonado y enviado a casa a morir. 01:14:41:18 Algunos de ellos han publicado libros sobre su recuperaci\u00f3n. 01:14:44:04 Viaj\u00e9 por todo el mundo, desde Holanda a Jap\u00f3n, y siempre el resultado era el mismo: recuperaci\u00f3n. 01:14:59:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: Incluso las arterias del coraz\u00f3n se pueden recuperar. 01:15:08:07 STEVE KROSCHEL: C uando el pr\u00edncipe Carlos habl\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente a favor de la terapia de Gerson, despu\u00e9s de observar su eficacia, fue ridiculizado por la comunidad m\u00e9dica. 01:15:18:12 Sin embargo, yo ya hab\u00eda notado su firme simpat\u00eda en una carta que fue enviada al Instituto Gerson. 01:15:28:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Charlotte Gerson habitualmente dicta charlas sobre la famosa terapia de su padre, alrededor del mundo. 01:15:34:07 CHARLOTTE GERSON: El Dr. Gerson dijo \"Dos cosas claves son la toxicidad y la deficiencia\". 01:15:40:27 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett estaba en el camino correcto con su programa de educaci\u00f3n en casa, y lo que acababa de ver lo involucraba m\u00e1s profundamente. 01:15:47:25 Ahora, el mundo empezaba a parecer un poquito m\u00e1s complicado para \u00e9l. 01:15:52:01 Mientras estudiaba varios art\u00edculos de revistas sobre la creciente incidencia del c\u00e1ncer, busc\u00f3 curiosa y cuidadosamente cualquier referencia sobre la terapia del Dr. Gerson en los medios de difusi\u00f3n popular. 01:16:14:19 STEVE KROSCHEL: En su lugar, lo que descubr i\u00f3 en las p\u00e1ginas de los art\u00edculos sobre c\u00e1ncer o enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas fue un enfoque distinto a la crisis, lo cual lo hizo sospechar. 01:16:26:21 Garrett quer\u00eda aprender m\u00e1s, y para su deleite, la familia de Gerson le envi\u00f3 algunos rollos de viejas pel\u00ed culas. 01:16:32:25 La imagen del Dr. Gerson con su familia, cobr\u00f3 vida. 01:16:44:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: Descubri\u00f3 una filmaci\u00f3n de una joven Charlotte Gerson en sus veintes que transport\u00f3 su imaginaci\u00f3n a las referencias hist\u00f3ricas del d\u00f3nde, por qu\u00e9 y c\u00f3mo esta familia de Alemania finalmente termin\u00f3 en los Estados Unidos. The Beautiful Truth 134 01:17:11:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando era un joven doctor en Alemania, Max Gerson se inspir\u00f3 en el m\u00e9dico investigador h\u00fangaro, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, quien descubri\u00f3 que si los doctores simpl emente se lavaban las manos entre parto y parto, las mujeres ya no mor\u00edan por infecciones. 01:17:26:25 STEVE KROSCHEL: El fue fuertemente ridiculizado por esa sugerencia. 01:17:29:23 Gerson tambi\u00e9n fue ridiculizado despu\u00e9s de descubrir que cambiando la di eta pod\u00eda curar sus migra\u00f1as y luego la tuberculosis. 01:17:37:13 Un experimento cl\u00ednico se llev\u00f3 a cabo con 450 pacientes con tuberculosis de piel incurable. 01:17:43:14 Ninguno de ellos se recuper\u00f3 al principio, y Gerson estaba devastado. 01:17:47:00 Pero se descubri\u00f3 que una enfermera hab\u00eda estado d\u00e1ndole a escondidas, dulces, cerveza y salchichas a los pacientes. 01:17:53:23 Despu\u00e9s de eso, la dieta Gerson fue estrictamente administrada, logrando la recuperaci\u00f3n de 446 de los 450 pacientes. 01:18:03 :12 Luego \u00e9l descubri\u00f3 que la dieta curaba el c\u00e1ncer. 01:18:08:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Gerson pudo escapar de la persecuci\u00f3n Nazi hacia los Estados Unidos con su familia. 01:18:14:21 \u00c9l continu\u00f3 curando no s\u00f3lo el c\u00e1ncer, s ino tambi\u00e9n otras enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas. 01:18:18:14 Y cuando su buen amigo, el Dr. Albert Schweitzer, se enferm\u00f3 de diabetes, \u00e9l tambi\u00e9n lo cur\u00f3, lo que hizo que Schweitzer declarara que Gerson era: \"El genio m\u00e1s importante en la historia m\u00e9dica.\" 01:18: 29:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: En julio de 1946, el Senador Claude Pepper llev\u00f3 a cabo audiencias de subcomit\u00e9 de Senado sobre la terapia contra el c\u00e1ncer del Dr. Gerson. 01:18:37:21 El sorprendente testimonio fue reportado r\u00e1pidamente por el comentarista de Noti cias ABC, Raymond Graham Swing, por Radio ABC. 01:18:45:04 La reacci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico fue inmediata y favorable. 01:18:47:19 Pero el reportaje result\u00f3 en el despido de Raymond Graham Swing dos semanas m\u00e1s tarde, debido a la fuerte presi\u00f3n de las Farmac\u00e9utic as y el Gremio M\u00e9dico Estadounidense. 01:18:57:13 VOZ DEL DR. MAX GERSON: Fui investigado en cinco ocasiones. 01:19:01:12 VOZ DEL REPORTERO: \u00bfQu\u00e9 quiere decir con ser investigado? 01:19:03:03 VOZ DEL DR. MAX GERSON: Por el Gremio M\u00e9dico. 01:19:04:12 VOZ DEL PERIODISTA: \u00bfEllos lo investigaron? 01:19:05:13 VOZ DEL DR. MAX GERSON: Si, cinco veces. The Beautiful Truth 135 01:19:07:19 Cada vez que ven\u00edan, yo les mostraba los pacientes que hab\u00edan sido enviados a casa a morir, ya curados. 01:19:15:03 Todos los pacientes enviados a casa a morir, curados. 01:19:19:07 El siguiente paciente enviado a casa a morir, curado. 01:19:23:07 STEVE KROSCHEL: Y realmente los cur\u00f3, incluidas personas con distrofia muscular, como esta ni\u00f1a. 01:19:31:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: Las conferencias p\u00fablicas del Dr. Gerson sobre su terapia no eran populares entre sus colegas. 01:19:36:10 Por ejemplo, Gerson hab\u00eda empezado a hablar p\u00fablicamente en contra del tabaco desde 1920. 01:19:40:24 PRESENTADOR DE TELEVISI\u00d3N: Un receso para muchos m\u00e9dicos es usualmente s\u00f3lo el tiempo empleado en disfrutar de un cigarrillo. 01:19:46:11 Y como ellos saben lo placentero que es fumarse un cigarrillo suave, de buen sabor, son muy cuidadosos al escoger la marca. 01:19:54:25 En una encuesta nacional repetida se les pregunt\u00f3 a m\u00e9dicos de todas las ramas de la medicina en todo el pa\u00eds: \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 clase de cigarrillo fuma usted , doctor?\" 01:20:05:10 Una vez m\u00e1s, la marca m\u00e1s nombrada fue Camel. 01:20:08:21 S\u00ed, de acuerdo a esta encuesta nacional repetida, m\u00e1s m\u00e9dicos fumaban Camels que ning\u00fan otro cigarrillo. 01:20:16:04 \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no cambiarse a Camel durante los siguientes 30 d\u00edas y ver la diferencia que \u00e9ste produce en el placer de fumar. 01:20:23:04 Note como los Camels le agradan a su garganta. 01:20:25:23 Note cuan suave y de buen sabor puede ser un cigarrillo. 01:20:29:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: Y a medida que m\u00e1s detalles de la terapia eran revelados y entendidos, se hac\u00eda m\u00e1s evidente para Garrett la raz\u00f3n de tanta oposici\u00f3n a la terapia de Gerson, la cual se preocupa por la salud , a diferencia de la usual frase \"Asistencia M\u00e9dica\". 01:20:41:04 Quiz\u00e1s otras prioridades estaban en juego aqu\u00ed. 01:20:43:27 El chico record\u00f3 la gran efectividad de un remedio que su padre hab\u00eda usado en su pie. 01:20:48:24 Los f\u00e1rmacos costosos y t\u00f3xi cos no hab\u00edan funcionado. 01:20:52:06 Pero con una simple mezcla de ajo picado y miel org\u00e1nica, el problema de su pie desapareci\u00f3. 01:21:01:04 La miel org\u00e1nica tambi\u00e9n desinfect\u00f3 y aceler\u00f3 la recuperaci\u00f3n de heridas y raspaduras. 01:21:07:23 STEVE KROSC HEL: Otro producto saludable, barato y no t\u00f3xico que se usaba, era el per\u00f3xido de hidr\u00f3geno. 01:21:13:18 Se lo usaba como limpiador en el hogar e incluso cosm\u00e9ticamente era \u00fatil para aclarar el cabello. 01:21:19:14 Garrett descubri\u00f3 que aplic\u00e1ndose per\u00f3x ido de hidr\u00f3geno al 3% en los o\u00eddos durante un tiempo, le ayudaba incluso a prevenir los refriados. 01:21:28:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: Hay muchos libros sobre remedios y tratamientos naturales. The Beautiful Truth 136 01:21:32:26 El conocimiento es poder. 01:21:35:14 Garrett le dio a su cachorro hu\u00e9rfano de alce llamado Frannie, su \u00faltima botella de leche de cabra. 01:21:43:05 Y as\u00ed, las lecciones de educaci\u00f3n en casa de Garrett pasaron a una nueva etapa. 01:21:46:22 Era el momento de llevar su tarea consigo en su jornada y de poner todo a una prueba final. 01:22:03:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: Todo el soporte para el estudio y an\u00e1lisis cient\u00edfico de Garrett sobre la terapia de Gerson surgi\u00f3 durante un desayuno con Charlotte Gerson en San Diego. 01:22:12:19 El hijo de Charlotte Gerson, Howar d Strauss, y un invitado especial que acababa de llegar de Eslovenia, tambi\u00e9n se uni\u00f3 a nosotros. 01:22:19:24 Fue aqu\u00ed donde Garrett comparar\u00eda sus notas sobre las declaraciones del Dr. Gerson, con fuentes independientes externas para comprobar si coincid \u00edan. 01:22:29:24 HOWARD STRAUS: La amalgama dental, y su - por cierto, los dentistas prefieren llamarla \"aleaci\u00f3n\", porque as\u00ed suena mucho m\u00e1s estable. 01:22:37:00 Pero la amalgama dental es la mayor y peor exposici\u00f3n al mercurio que la mayor\u00eda de los es tadounidenses tienen en sus vidas. 01:22:45:01 STEVE KROSCHEL: Si eso es verdad, entonces, millones de personas han sufrido innecesariamente una gran cantidad de males por m\u00e1s de un siglo, sin darse cuenta que la verdadera causa estaba en sus cabezas. 01:22:55:17 Yo estaba a punto de filmar una demostraci\u00f3n que probar\u00eda esto sin dejar ninguna duda. 01:23:01:03 El Dr. Roger Eichman y el Dr. David Kennedy instalaron una pantalla fosforescente y una luz sensible a los vapores de mercurio que, de existir, sa ldr\u00edan de los dientes al m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo est\u00edmulo. 01:23:13:24 Ten\u00edamos dientes con empastes de amalgama que se colocar\u00edan en agua a temperatura ambiente simulando la saliva en la boca. 01:23:20:26 En realidad no cre\u00eda que vapores de mercurio saldr\u00edan de los dientes, ni que si eso ocurr\u00eda, la c\u00e1mara los podr\u00eda filmar. 01:23:27:01 Yo ten\u00eda tambi\u00e9n una c\u00e1mara de video a la mano para grabar el evento. 01:23:36:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: Para mi sorpresa y horror, y, como pueden ver, la c\u00e1mara de 35 mm si grab\u00f3 los vapo res de mercurio que sal\u00edan de los dientes. 01:23:50:11 Esta era la primera vez en la historia que esto hab\u00eda sido captado por una c\u00e1mara de video. 01:24:01:29 STEVE KROSCHEL: Para asegurar que lo que est\u00e1n viendo es mercurio, ten\u00edamos a la mano un instru mento especial llamado Detector de Mercurio Jerome para medir los niveles. 01:24:12:14 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: 191. The Beautiful Truth 137 01:24:14:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: 190. Mu\u00e9stramelo, por favor. 01:24:16:17 191. Es eso alto? 01:24:18:20 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Mm, con 100 ya cerrar\u00eda n la f\u00e1brica y evacuar\u00edan. 01:24:22:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00a1Vaya! Dios m\u00edo. Bueno. 01:24:25:09 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Ahora, piensa en esto -- 01:24:26:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: Apaga la luz. 01:24:27:17 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Esto es a temperatura ambiente, un diente, de por lo menos 50 a\u00f1os. 01:24:32:24 Ha estado liberando gases por a\u00f1os, y, mm, mucha gente tiene la boca llena de estos. 01:24:41:12 STEVE KROSCHEL: As\u00ed es. 01:24:41:26 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: Ahora, s\u00f3lo piensa en lo que suceder\u00eda si tienes media docena de p ersonas en un ascensor, todos soltando vapores como \u00e9ste, y liberando gases 24 horas al d\u00eda, los 7 d\u00edas de la semana. 01:24:55:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: As\u00ed es. 01:24:55:13 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: \u00bfY las normas de la ASSO se basan en una semana de 40 horas. 01:24:59 :25 STEVE KROSCHEL: A continuaci\u00f3n, el Dr. Kennedy coloc\u00f3 en el mostrador un mezclador que los dentistas usan para mezclar las c\u00e1psulas de amalgama, las cuales despu\u00e9s de mezclarse son abiertas para colocarse como empaste en la boca de un paciente. 01:25: 16:12 Las c\u00e1psulas de amalgama luego se alinean una por una en una batidora donde se baten por un rato. 01:25:23:16 Sin que el paciente tenga idea, las c\u00e1psulas son abiertas, as\u00ed como cualquier dentista o asistente dental lo hace. 01:25:30:13 \u00bfSe libera r\u00e1 vapor de mercurio? 01:25:32:12 A estas alturas, yo ya sab\u00eda cu\u00e1l ser\u00eda la respuesta. 01:25:36:06 Recuerden que \u00e9ste es un procedimiento usual que sucede diariamente en todo el mundo, en los consultorios dentales junto a pacientes inocentes. 01:25:55:2 8 STEVE KROSCHEL: Las im\u00e1genes hablan por s\u00ed mismas. 01:25:58:02 Ser\u00eda absurdo que la Asociaci\u00f3n Dental Americana contin\u00fae insistiendo que las amalgamas son saludables . 01:26:05:13 STEVE KROSCHEL: Encienda la luz. ver 01:26:13:28 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: S\u00ed, la habitaci\u00f3n se ha contaminado. 01:26:15:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: As\u00ed es. 01:26:16:29 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Y esto no es peor que trabajar en un consultorio dental. The Beautiful Truth 138 01:26:19:20 DR. DAVID KENNEDY: Creo que es un crimen lo que est\u00e1n haci\u00e9ndole a sus asistentes, y es que el sistema reproductivo de la mujer es mucho m\u00e1s sensible al me rcurio, y como resultado se obtiene no solamente infertilidad sino tambi\u00e9n defectos de nacimiento. 01:26:32:12 Claro que hay quienes lo niegan, pero las publicaciones cient\u00edficas est\u00e1n llenas de estudios que muestran que la exposici\u00f3n al mercurio - ya sea de los dientes o por trabajar en un consultorio dental... 01:26:44:03 Es obvio, ya viste la demostraci\u00f3n. 01:26:45:21 Hay enormes cantidades de mercurio en esos consultorios. 01:26:47:14 Ellos no controlan eso ni advierten a los empleados; no les dan ni m\u00e1scaras ni protecci\u00f3n adecuadas. 01:26:54:24 Y como resultado, hay una gran cantidad de infertilidad entre las asistentes dentales. 01:26:58:14 Hay un documental sobre eso. 01:26:59:24 Es sobre las asistentes dentales noruegas y sus vidas arruinadas por su trabajo cuando eran j\u00f3venes. 01:27:06:15 Pienso que es un crimen lo que les est\u00e1n haciendo a estas j\u00f3venes mujeres. 01:27:10:01 DR. ROGER EICHMAN: He tenido pacientes que han venido de otros dentistas diciendo \"Dios, lo \u00fanico que me hicieron fue una limpieza dental, y me he sentido terrible por varios d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de eso \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1?\" 01:27:20:16 Bueno, ellos pulen los dientes, haciendo que una enorme cantidad de mercurio se libere por varios d\u00edas hasta que se forma una peque\u00f1a cantidad de corro si\u00f3n en la parte superior que hace que las emanaciones disminuyan un poco. 01:27:34:01 Pero la cantidad liberada de mercurio es realmente fenomenal. 01:27:39:00 Y si fueran sensibles al mercurio, ser\u00edan puestos en una situaci\u00f3n de alto riesgo. 01:27:42:1 2 Cuando estudiaba odontolog\u00eda escuch\u00e9 que los dentistas en promedio, sufr\u00edan de su primer ataque card\u00edaco a los 44 a\u00f1os. 01:27:50:02 Nuestra esperanza de vida era de 52 a\u00f1os. 01:27:53:25 Personalmente lo relacion\u00e9 con el uso de mercurio y empastes de amalgama, porque eso no suced\u00eda ni en ortodoncia ni con los cirujanos. 01:28:05:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Me hab\u00eda asegurado de que Garrett no estuviera cerca de esta demostraci\u00f3n, para que \u00e9l no inhale nada de los vapores de mercurio. 01:28:12:03 Sin embargo, p arece absurdo si se considera que muchas personas andan por ah\u00ed tan tranquilos con amalgamas en sus bocas. 01:28:18:05 El Dr. Gerson hab\u00eda tenido siempre la raz\u00f3n. 01:28:20:13 La salud dental es fundamental para la curaci\u00f3n de las enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas. The Beautiful Truth 139 01:28:27:08 STEVE KROSCHEL: En Colorado Springs, Colorado, hay un distinguido dentista que ha hablado p\u00fablicamente por d\u00e9cadas sobre el fluoruro, amalgamas dentales e incluso sobre los peligros de los tratamientos de conductos. 01:28:37:09 Su nombre es D r. Hal Huggins. 01:28:40:02 Pero justo antes de conocerlo, Garrett cay\u00f3 en depresi\u00f3n. 01:28:44:22 \u00c9l parec\u00eda no poder superar la perturbadora clase de qu\u00edmica del Dr. Roger Eichman sobre los mortales vapores met\u00edlicos de mercurio. 01:28:52:11 Esta lecci \u00f3n de educaci\u00f3n en casa realmente lo hab\u00eda impactado. 01:28:57:03 Y entonces se supo la causa de su tristeza. 01:29:00:03 Sin saberlo, tambi\u00e9n los padres del chico hab\u00edan permitido que un dentista le ponga mercurio en su boca. 01:29:05:02 Ahora \u00e9l mismo se ve\u00eda como un riesgo biol\u00f3gico. 01:29:07:17 Pero lo bueno era que estaba a punto de conocer al Dr. Hal Huggins, quien le dar\u00eda tranquilidad. 01:29:13:07 DR. HAL HUGGINS: Bueno, la mayor\u00eda de las personas que he visto, que se est\u00e1n deshaciendo de sus am algamas, tienen alguna enfermedad extra\u00f1a. 01:29:19:24 \u00bfPero t\u00fa est\u00e1s interesado en prevenci\u00f3n? 01:29:22:01 Entonces eres el uno en 100 que va por buen camino, porque prevenir es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil que corregir un problema despu\u00e9s de ocurrido. 01:29:31:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00c9l le pregunt\u00f3 que cu\u00e1ntos dentistas dicen que los empastes de mercurio son seguros. 01:29:34:17 DR. HAL HUGGINS: Bueno, creo que ser\u00eda muy cercano al 100% si quieren seguir siendo dentistas en el futuro. 01:29:38:28 Porque la asociaci\u00f3n dental tiene ciertas reglas y normas de que si se le pregunta a un dentista \"\u00bfEs el mercurio t\u00f3xico?\" y ellos contestan afirmativamente - Si ellos responden \"Bueno, s\u00ed, es el metal m\u00e1s venenoso en el planeta que no es radiactivo\" - mm, perder\u00edan su licenci a y estar\u00edan vendiendo carros usados al siguiente d\u00eda. 01:29:59:07 Lo que ellos creen y lo que pueden decir son dos cosas diferentes. 01:30:03:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: Luego, \u00e9l quiso saber cu\u00e1les dentistas sab\u00edan c\u00f3mo quitar las amalgamas apropiadamente. 01:30:06:27 DR. HAL HUGGINS: De aquellas personas que se hacen sacar sus amalgamas al azar, mm, el 63% termina con una enfermedad auto -inmune dentro de los siguientes seis meses, la cual no ten\u00edan antes de sacarse las amalgamas. 01:30:21:24 Algo que muy pocas personas saben - Acabo de enterarme de eso - es que los dentistas tienen seguro contra negligencia m\u00e9dica. 01:30:29:04 Claro, eso est\u00e1 bien. The Beautiful Truth 140 01:30:31:09 Pero, cuando el dentista toma el mercurio, polvo de cobre, esta\u00f1o, zinc y plata, y los mezcla, se convierte en un fabricante, y los dentistas no tienen seguro de responsabilidad civil de fabricantes de productos. 01:30:46:23 El golpe les caer\u00e1 precisamente donde no est\u00e1n asegurados. 01:30:50:11 Y es que ellos est\u00e1n poniendo una sustancia venenosa en la boca de la gente y no est\u00e1n asegurados contra eso. 01:30:57:24 Los abogados los destruir\u00e1n, en mi opini\u00f3n. 01:31:03:22 Mm, si nos proyectamos de 5 a 10 a\u00f1os en el futuro, las \u00fanicas personas que podr\u00e1n sacarte las amalgamas ser\u00e1n los abogados. 01:31: 09:20 STEVE KROSCHEL: El Dr. Huggins le recomend\u00f3 a Garrett un dentista que s\u00ed sab\u00eda c\u00f3mo sacar las amalgamas de forma segura. 01:31:14:13 El chico record\u00f3 una pregunta que le hab\u00eda hecho al Dr. Huggins sobre las represalias por hablar p\u00fablicamente. 01:31:20:07 DR. HAL HUGGINS: S\u00ed, ha habido un sinn\u00famero de casos de represalias. 01:31:23:16 Lo primero que hicieron fue reunir una gran cantidad de dinero para suspender mi licencia por negarme a usar amalgamas y hacer tratamientos de conductos, y por escri bir un libro que a ellos no les gustaba. 01:31:37:24 Han hecho cosas personales en contra m\u00eda y de mi familia, lo cual destruy\u00f3 la familia. 01:31:44:11 Tambi\u00e9n me destruyeron el negocio. 01:31:46:21 Han destruido todo lo que ten\u00eda, excepto la hipoteca d e mi casa; por alguna raz\u00f3n u otra, no quer\u00edan eso. 01:31:56:13 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett se dio cuenta que la vida del Dr. Huggins habr\u00eda sido mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil si se hubiera quedado callado como la mayor\u00eda de los m\u00e9dicos. 01:32:02:17 Por lo que la surge la pregunta... 01:32:04:14 GARRETT: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 usted se puso en esta situaci\u00f3n? 01:32:08:16 DR. HAL HUGGINS: Si t\u00fa hubieras visto la gente que yo he visto con s\u00f3lo unos pocos minutos, unas pocas horas de vida, y ves que eso se puede cambiar, y ves a\u00f1os m\u00e1s t arde que esta gente ha sobrevivido, esa es mi recompensa. 01:32:26:03 Es por eso que sigo haciendo lo que hago. 01:32:29:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: Esa manera de pensar tan inspiradora, hizo que Garrett recordara al Dr. Gerson. 01:32:33:18 Pero a\u00fan as\u00ed es como David contra Goliat. 01:32:36:02 En esta situaci\u00f3n, la Asociaci\u00f3n Dental Americana tiene gran poder y control sobre la vida de un dentista, y el dentista que sac\u00f3 adecuadamente el empaste de amalgama de Garrett ten\u00eda mucho miedo de que su identidad fuera revelada en esta pel\u00edcula. The Beautiful Truth 141 01:32:49:29 Tuvimos que firmar documentos que me responsabilizaban directamente por la ruina de su carrera y de sus ingresos si filmaba su rostro. 01:33:02:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: Audiencias sobre empastes de mercurio se est\u00e1n dando ahora en Washington, lo que esperamos ponga fin a este desastre con las amalgamas. 01:33:10:00 Al momento se estima que hay 1000 toneladas de mercurio en los empastes de los estadounidenses. 01:33:15:19 Incre\u00edblemente, la FDA nunca ha realizado una eva luaci\u00f3n ambiental sobre el uso de amalgamas dentales de mercurio, seg\u00fan dicta la ley. 01:33:24:29 CHARLOTTE GERSON: Es muy importante para la gente ortodoxa evitar que los pacientes vengan a tratamientos alternativos, porque estos s\u00ed funcionan. 01:33:34:1 2 A la gente le han lavado el cerebro por tanto tiempo. 01:33:37:17 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfPero qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda ser peor que el tema sobre salud dental? 01:33:40:15 Ciertamente, los aditivos alimentarios no podr\u00edan ser tan malos. 01:33:43:12 HOWARD STRAUS: GMS (G lutamato Monos\u00f3dico) es - es un qu\u00edmico tremendamente perjudicial. 01:33:48:22 Lo que hace el GMS en realidad - apaga el interruptor en tu cerebro que dice \"Ya he comido suficiente\". 01:33:56:21 El problema con el GMS, sin embargo, es que es una excito - toxina. 01:34:00:19 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es una excito -toxina? 01:34:03:06 Hay miles de estudios y suficientes art\u00edculos sobre el tema como para llenar una peque\u00f1a biblioteca. 01:34:07:16 La evidencia se ha acumulado, y luego se acumul\u00f3 un poco m\u00e1s. 01:34:11:26 Est\u00e1 ah\u00ed para que cualquiera la lea. 01:34:13:23 Pero la industria de alimentos procesados espera que los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n y la gente com\u00fan est\u00e9n muy ocupados, sean vagos o demasiado ingenuos como para entender las sutilezas del tema ci ent\u00edfico en discusi\u00f3n. 01:34:29:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero en caso de que la gente com\u00fan muestre un poco de curiosidad sobre los riesgos de saborizantes como el GMS, la industria alimenticia sabiamente ha impreso volantes y folletos para nosotros, y asi defe nder su fr\u00e1gil posici\u00f3n. 01:34:44:05 Garrett se reuni\u00f3 con los expertos en alimentos, Jack y Adrienne Samuels, de la compa\u00f1\u00eda \"Truth in Labeling\" (Veracidad en las Etiquetas). 01:34:49:19 JACK SAMUELS: El tema del \u00e1cido glut\u00e1mico es muy, muy complejo. 01:34:55:00 Y, en consecuencia, muchos trucos se pueden usar para convencer a la gente de que es seguro. The Beautiful Truth 142 01:35:03:17 Ellos quitaron \"glutamato monos\u00f3dico\" de muchos de sus productos y lo reemplazaron con nombres de otros ingredientes que no dec\u00edan nada al consumidor sobre la presencia del componente reactivo del glutamato monos\u00f3dico. 01:35:18:25 Despu\u00e9s de que mi m\u00e9dico - quien vi\u00f3 una de mis reacciones al GMS - me dijera que pronto morir\u00eda por exposici\u00f3n al GMS, si no aprend\u00eda a evitarlo, Adrienne us\u00f3 su experiencia en investigaci\u00f3n y fue a la biblioteca, invirtiendo unas 4.000 horas para leer todo lo que pudo encontrar sobre GMS. 01:35:42:04 Para su sorpresa, se encontr\u00f3 con estudios que indicaban que el GMS era seguro, pero todos eran patrocinados por l a industria del glutamato o por sus agentes, y ten\u00edan tantos errores hasta el punto de ser inservibles. 01:35:58:23 Y, al mismo tiempo, hab\u00edan muchos otros estudios que demostraban claramente que el glutamato monos\u00f3dico era t\u00f3xico y peligroso. 01:36:06:08 STEVE KROSCHEL: Jack y Adrienne Samuels tienen una idea muy clara sobre las investigaciones acerca del GMS desde que la verdadera investigaci\u00f3n empezara sobre este aditivo. 01:36:14:24 Garrett todav\u00eda quer\u00eda hacer de abogado del diablo, e indag\u00f3 en la investigaci\u00f3n, porque ahora se estaba volviendo m\u00e1s claro para \u00e9l durante esta clase de educaci\u00f3n en casa que cada lado de un tema tiene razones para adoptar una posici\u00f3n. 01:36:26:21 El reto es determinar la fuerza impulsora detr\u00e1s de cualquier estudio ci ent\u00edfico. 01:36:32:11 Es el dinero o la moral? 01:36:35:26 Pero lo que el muchacho descubri\u00f3 - al igual que Jack y Adrienne Samuels - es que no hay persona, instituci\u00f3n u organismo alguno que haya afirmado que el GMS es seguro, que no tenga estrechos v\u00edn culos con las industrias de alimentos y/o medicamentos o que no haya sido remunerado por ellos. 01:36:54:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: El neurocient\u00edfico Dr. John Olney, ha estudiado el GMS por d\u00e9cadas. 01:36:59:01 \u00c9l rara vez da entrevistas debido a la atenci\u00f3n no deseada que incita. 01:37:04:04 DR. JOHN OLNEY: Mi experiencia es en neuropatolog\u00eda experimental. 01:37:08:01 Dirig\u00ed un estudio sobre el glutamato monos\u00f3dico y su potencial toxicidad en animales beb\u00e9s. 01:37:20:23 Y descubr\u00ed que el glutamato destruye l as c\u00e9lulas nerviosas en los cerebros en desarrollo de los animales beb\u00e9s. 01:37:31:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Yo pod\u00eda entender su timidez ante las c\u00e1maras porque \u00e9l hab\u00eda sido una pieza importante en la evidencia incriminatoria contra la industria alimenticia po r varios a\u00f1os. 01:37:40:27 Sus resultados impactan a la gente, especialmente a los padres de ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os. The Beautiful Truth 143 01:37:46:12 Pero cuando viajas lejos de casa, la pregunta entonces es para Garrett, \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 comes?\" 01:37:51:05 En su casa en Alaska o al visitar a la familia Gerson, su dieta era pr\u00e1cticamente libre de cualquier alimento procesado. 01:37:57:13 Toma un esfuerzo extra el conseguir productos org\u00e1nicos deliciosos y/o restaurantes. 01:38:05:16 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00a1Alto! 01:38:07:08 Despu\u00e9s de todo esto, no pens\u00e9 - ya es demasiado tarde. 01:38:11:17 Los qu\u00edmicos de esta comida r\u00e1pida ya surt\u00edan su efecto m\u00e1gico en el chico. 01:38:15:11 Se comi\u00f3 esta comida - en realidad, dos comidas - como si estuviera pose\u00eddo. 01:38:19:02 Para m\u00ed, fue decepcionante, pe ro forzar la situaci\u00f3n probablemente ser\u00eda contraproducente. 01:38:23:16 \u00c9l era libre de tomar sus propias decisiones. 01:38:37:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: Tres horas m\u00e1s tarde, en un avi\u00f3n rumbo a Jackson, Mississippi, los resultados eran evidentes. 01:38:51:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: En Jackson, Mississippi, el chico se reuni\u00f3 con una incre\u00edble familia de fot\u00f3grafos, los Blaylock. 01:38:59:07 El Dr. Russell Blaylock es un prestigioso neurocirujano certificado, autor de varios libros sobre c\u00e1ncer, excito -toxinas y salu d. 01:39:08:25 Es un l\u00edder en la campa\u00f1a para advertir al p\u00fablico sobre esta atrocidad en contra de la salud. 01:39:13:21 Quiz\u00e1s \"atrocidad\" sea una palabra muy fuerte. 01:39:17:08 Si lo que \u00e9l dice es cierto, es dif\u00edcil pensar en alguna otra. 01:39:22: 10 Es aqu\u00ed donde Garrett escoge ahora un refrigerio saludable. 01:39:26:15 Pero sin que el joven lo sepa, yo ten\u00eda planeado un peque\u00f1o test. 01:39:29:27 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: El consumo masivo de esta sustancia excito -t\u00f3xica en los alimentos interfiere con las habilidades de la gente de pensar, recordar y usar el lenguaje y as\u00ed nuestros ni\u00f1os ya no tienen la misma capacidad que ten\u00edan sus padres. 01:39:43:14 Y creo que esto se est\u00e1 agravando, porque cada vez hay m\u00e1s alimentos con diferentes tipos de est as excito -toxinas: cuatro, cinco, seis en el mismo alimento. 01:39:53:01 Hay ni\u00f1os - los peque\u00f1os en particular - que est\u00e1n consumiendo grandes cantidades, lo que interfiere con el desarrollo del cerebro, as\u00ed como destruye las conexiones entre las neurona s. 01:40:04:15 Y eso interfiere con el funcionamiento del cerebro. 01:40:06:10 Y eso es lo que estamos viendo en todo el pa\u00eds, y de hecho, a nivel mundial en los pa\u00edses industrializados. 01:40:11:25 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: La raz\u00f3n por la que los fabrican tes de alimentos le dicen al p\u00fablico que es seguro, es que ellos est\u00e1n lucrando de eso. The Beautiful Truth 144 01:40:18:01 Y es dif\u00edcil competir con los otros fabricantes si no se usa el GMS, porque es un saborizante muy poderoso. 01:40:26:15 As\u00ed simplemente tienden a ignorar todas las investigaciones, aunque literalmente son miles de estudios. 01:40:32:06 Y siguen apareciendo m\u00e1s estudios que prueban sin lugar a duda que esto est\u00e1 da\u00f1ando los cerebros de la gente. 01:40:39:23 Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 causando obesidad m\u00f3rbida, s\u00edndrome metab\u00f3lico, diabetes, diabetes infantil, arteriosclerosis; un gran n\u00famero de enfermedades han sido ahora asociadas con la exposici\u00f3n al GMS. 01:40:52:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: En la mesa colocaron chips de tortilla que conten\u00edan GMS. 01:40:56:01 \u00bfHab\u00eda Garrett h echo su tarea? 01:40:57:13 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: Algo que la gente no entiende es que esto podr\u00eda ser una toxicidad silenciosa. 01:41:02:09 Es decir, ellos ni siquiera saben que esto est\u00e1 ocurriendo. 01:41:04:22 Mucha gente me dice \"Bueno, yo no tengo n inguna reacci\u00f3n. 01:41:06:28 No tengo s\u00edntomas como n\u00e1useas, v\u00f3mitos o jaquecas\". 01:41:10:11 Bueno, muchas personas expuestas al GMS no presentan s\u00edntomas, pero son igualmente afectadas. 01:41:16:25 Y esto ocurre durante un largo per\u00edodo de tiempo: d\u00e9c adas. 01:41:20:16 Las neuronas est\u00e1n siendo destruidas, y mientras no pierdan suficientes, no se dar\u00e1n cuenta que est\u00e1n siendo afectados por esta toxicidad. 01:41:29:13 En neurolog\u00eda, se sabe que se debe perder aproximadamente un 90% de neuronas en un \u00e1r ea espec\u00edfica del cerebro para desarrollar s\u00edntomas. 01:41:38:01 Entonces, cuando ya aparecen s\u00edntomas como demencia o enfermedad de Parkinson, etc., ya hemos perdido el 90% de nuestras neuronas en esa parte del cerebro y eso es muy importante. 01:41:48:1 7 DR. RUSSELL BLAYLOCK: Otro nuevo e importante descubrimiento es que el GMS est\u00e1 fuertemente relacionado con el desarrollo de c\u00e1ncer. 01:41:54:16 Y sabemos que aumentando la cantidad de glutamato en la dieta de una persona, hace que el c\u00e1ncer crezca muy r\u00e1pidamente y se torne altamente invasivo. 01:42:03:00 Eso significa que se propaga por todo el cuerpo. 01:42:05:05 El problema es que nadie les dice a los pacientes con c\u00e1ncer que deben tener mucho cuidado con el consumo de estos aditivos alimenticios. 01:42:11:28 Porque hace que el c\u00e1ncer crezca mucho m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido y se vuelva m\u00e1s invasivo, lo que hace menos probable que sobrevivan al c\u00e1ncer. 01:42:20:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett nunca comi\u00f3 esos chips de tortilla. 01:42:22:27 \u00c9l quiere mantener todas su s neuronas. The Beautiful Truth 145 01:42:25:03 El n\u00famero de productos alimenticios que contienen GMS sin indicarlo en sus etiquetas, es casi infinito. 01:42:31:10 La \u00fanica manera de evitarlo es comprando productos org\u00e1nicos y no procesados. 01:42:35:17 Lo que el chico tambi\u00e9n descubri\u00f3 es que esto era otra confirmaci\u00f3n de los descubrimientos de Gerson de hace 80 a\u00f1os. 01:42:41:25 Con el fin de producir un informe imparcial sobre el tema de alimentos procesados, el chico vol\u00f3 de Jackson, Mississippi a Omaha, Nebraska, a ver si pod\u00eda entrevistar alg\u00fan relacionista p\u00fablico de la compa\u00f1\u00eda de Alimentos ConAgra. 01:42:55:03 Despu\u00e9s de varias llamadas telef\u00f3nicas y un mensaje enviado por fax, el chico pens\u00f3 que estaba logrando algo. 01:43:00:12 Pero estaba equivocado. 01:43:01:28 Nadie de ese enorme edificio quiso hablar. 01:43:05:04 Esto confundi\u00f3 y alter\u00f3 al chico temporalmente. 01:43:13:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: En mi opini\u00f3n, tanta seguridad y la renuencia a hablar demostraba arrogancia suprema, especialmente si se considera que ell os nos est\u00e1n alimentando - o al menos a algunos de nosotros - diariamente. 01:43:23:19 Me record\u00f3 a las instalaciones en Alaska del proyecto militar HAARP que investiga el clima, y a mis experiencias tratando de conseguir entrevistas con empresas petroler as las que me rechazaron rotundamente. 01:43:40:01 La gente nativa del norte y sus preocupaciones no son prioritarias. 01:43:43:22 El chico trat\u00f3 de contactar a ConAgra dos veces m\u00e1s, pero sin \u00e9xito. 01:43:50:19 STEVE KROSCHEL: Sin embargo, no todo esta ba perdido. 01:43:52:14 Fuimos al Parque Mayberry de Omaha, donde Garrett encontr\u00f3 gran regocijo una vez m\u00e1s. 01:44:06:22 HOWARD STRAUS: Tenemos que volver a Hip\u00f3crates. 01:44:09:00 \u00c9l dijo, lo primero es \"no hacer da\u00f1o\". 01:44:10:27 Bueno, todo f\u00e1rmac o produce da\u00f1o. 01:44:14:20 Tambi\u00e9n dijo \"Deja que el alimento sea tu medicina y que la medicina sea tu alimento\". 01:44:20:16 Eso es muy importante, porque la comida te alimenta y te sana. 01:44:26:00 Son elementos naturales que tu cuerpo sabe c\u00f3mo uti lizar. 01:44:29:24 Tu cuerpo ha evolucionado por millones de a\u00f1os para usarlos, mientras que estas grandes e incre\u00edblemente lucrativas compa\u00f1\u00edas en todo el mundo causan da\u00f1o, son t\u00f3xicas al h\u00edgado, y causan enfermedades. 01:44:42:24 Entonces, \u00bfc\u00f3mo puede n considerarse medicina, si lo que est\u00e1n causando son enfermedades? 01:44:47:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: Si no pudimos hablar con ning\u00fan fabricante de alimentos, tal vez podr\u00edamos hablar con un ingeniero de alimentos. The Beautiful Truth 146 01:44:54:00 Conozcan a Carol Hoernlein. 01:44: 55:13 La conocimos en el aeropuerto de St. Louis, Missouri, y la estamos llevando a una entrevista de radio. 01:45:00:06 A lo largo del camino, tuvimos tiempo suficiente para hacer turismo. 01:45:03:09 Garrett, en particular, tuvo tiempo para asimilar m ucha informaci\u00f3n. 01:45:07:21 Escuch\u00f3 gran parte de la conversaci\u00f3n que proven\u00eda del asiento delantero acerca de otro aditivo alimentario que lo hizo recordar. 01:45:13:26 DR. JOHN OLNEY: En 1974, hice una petici\u00f3n al comisionado de la FDA con respecto a cierta evidencia que encontr\u00e9 sobre que el aspartame podr\u00eda causar, mm, lesiones cerebrales. 01:45:27:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: Pero a pesar de las advertencias, el ex - director de la empresa G.D. Searle, Donald Rumsfeld, introdujo el producto al mercado de to dos modos. 01:45:34:01 Siendo una ingeniera en alimentos bien remunerada y respetada, Carol era la persona adecuada para trabajar con esta sustancia peligrosa. 01:45:39:26 No pas\u00f3 mucho tiempo y empez\u00f3 a llenarse de tumores desde la gl\u00e1ndula pituitaria hasta sus ovarios. 01:45:44:20 Aument\u00f3 mucho de peso y sigue teniendo problemas de salud. 01:45:47:25 Carol nunca volver\u00e1 a ser la misma. 01:45:49:29 Ya no quiere volver a trabajar como ingeniera de alimentos porque, dice, \"No puedo trabajar en un l ugar donde s\u00e9 que estoy envenenando a la gente\". 01:45:58:13 CAROL HOERNLEIN: En realidad esta historia es peor que la del tabaco, porque al menos uno puede optar por no fumar. 01:46:04:15 Con la comida, no hay elecci\u00f3n. 01:46:07:21 STEVE KROSCHEL: Ahor a ya est\u00e1bamos en la estaci\u00f3n de radio donde Carol tendr\u00eda la oportunidad de contarle al mundo su historia, y lo que los aditivos alimentarios como el GMS y el aspartame le hacen a cualquier desafortunado organismo que entre en contacto con ellos. 01:46:20 :03 Este programa de radio \"The Power Hour\" se puede escuchar en todo el mundo por radio de onda corta o Internet todos los d\u00edas, en vivo o en retransmisiones. 01:46:28:15 LOCUTOR DE RADIO: Enfurecidos hasta el punto de levantarse, salir y volverse activ istas; est\u00e1n protestando en las calles y escribiendo cartas. 01:46:34:21 VOZ MASCULINA: Si. 01:46:35:07 JOYCE RILEY: Bueno, Carol Hoernlein es experta en GMS y ha estado reuniendo informaci\u00f3n sorprendente e incre\u00edble para ustedes. 01:46:45:19 Es MSGTr uth.org. 01:46:48:13 Ese es su sitio web. The Beautiful Truth 147 01:46:49:07 Ella se lastim\u00f3 por usar GMS, aunque en realidad no lo usaba, se lo causaron a ella. 01:46:55:24 Y lo utilizabas en grandes cantidades, \u00bfverdad? 01:46:58:05 CAROL HOERNLEIN: B\u00e1sicamente yo sacaba el aspartame de los barriles con palas. 01:47:00:22 JOYCE RILEY: \u00a1Vaya! \u00bfPueden creer eso barriles con pala? 01:47:04:26 CAROL HOERNLEIN: He tenido much\u00edsimos problemas durante a\u00f1os. 01:47:07:12 JOYCE RILEY: \u00bfY qu \u00e9 hay de aquellas tiritas? 01:47:08:12 Ya sabes, aquellas tiritas con el qu\u00edmico? 01:47:09:09 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Si, bueno, las tiritas de disoluci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida, como las l\u00e1minas de Listerine? 01:47:12:12 JOYCE RILEY: S\u00ed, esas de disoluci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida. 01:47:13:1 0 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Listerine, las l\u00e1minas de disoluci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de Listerine tambi\u00e9n contienen aspartame. 01:47:17:10 JOYCE RILEY: Guau. As\u00ed que, si tienen alguna duda, pueden visitar el sitio web mencionado anteriormente. 01:47:20:27 Nosotros publicamos algo sobre esto en nuestro sitio web hace a\u00f1os, y ahora tengo el placer de conocerte aqu\u00ed mismo en nuestros estudios, esto es realmente genial. 01:47:29:14 Es estupendo. 01:47:30:07 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Claro que s\u00ed, les agradezco mucho. 01:47:31:23 Cuando vi aquello en la web, estaba tan emocionada que ustedes lo hab\u00edan publicado, y... 01:47:36:19 JOYCE RILEY: Se\u00f1oras y se\u00f1ores, me gustar\u00eda presentarles hoy a nuestra delegada, Carol Hoernlein. 01:47:42:28 Muchas gracias, Carol, por estar con nosotros en \"The Power Hour\" el d\u00eda de hoy. 01:47:45:17 CAROL HOERNLEIN: Oh. Muchas gracias. 01:47:46:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: Si el programa \"The Power Hour\" permite que personas como Carol puedan hablar sobre estos temas, deben ser creativos cuando est\u00e1n al aire. 01:47: 53:15 Los anunciantes apoyan a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n porque pueden patrocinar productos farmac\u00e9uticos, alimentos procesados y qu\u00edmicos letales. 01:48:01:03 Pero no aqu\u00ed. 01:48:02:03 \"The Power Hour\" vende productos naturales, saborizantes de alimen tos, libros y DVD's. 01:48:09:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: Despu\u00e9s del programa, vi al co - presentador Dave vonKleist tomando un descanso con Garrett en el jard\u00edn delantero. 01:48:18:14 DAVE VONKLEIST: Est\u00e1 bien. 01:48:24:26 Bueno. 01:48:26:27 STEVE KROSCHEL: La presentadora Joyce Riley conoc\u00eda a Charlotte Gerson as\u00ed como a la terapia Gerson. The Beautiful Truth 148 01:48:31:15 Joyce trabaj\u00f3 como enfermera en el ej\u00e9rcito, y la Guerra del Golfo la afect\u00f3 con el \"S\u00edndrome de la Guerra del Golfo\", una enfermedad. 01:48:38:03 Luego produjo una alarmante pel\u00edcula llamada \"Beyond Treason\", que documentaba el grave impacto ambiental causado por las municiones de EEUU revestidas con uranio empobrecido, vacunas experimentales, y m\u00e1s. 01:48:49:23 Las consecuencias de estas actividades son terri bles. 01:48:52:28 El uranio empobrecido radioactivo, por ejemplo, tiene una vida media de 4.500 millones de a\u00f1os, habiendo contaminado las regiones del Medio Oriente para siempre. 01:49:30:25 STEVE KROSCHEL: Joyce explic\u00f3 el S\u00edndrome de la Guerra del Gol fo que afect\u00f3 al personal militar. 01:49:35:03 JOYCE RILEY: La enfermedad de la Guerra del Golfo es como una combinaci\u00f3n de muchas toxinas, y yo no pod\u00eda entender por qu\u00e9 estaba enferma si tan s\u00f3lo volaba de Alaska a Cuba mientras era enfermera de vuelo. 01:49:45:16 Pero me enferm\u00e9. 01:49:46:21 Pero s\u00ed fui vacunada. 01:49:48:05 Muchos soldados estuvieron expuestos al fuego de los pozos petroleros, a sustancias qu\u00edmicas, biol\u00f3gicas, vacunas, y todo lo dem\u00e1s. 01:49:54:22 Lo que ahora sabemos es que ellos estaban llenos de toxinas. 01:49:58:24 Fui enfermera durante 35 a\u00f1os, y durante ese tiempo hice de todo, desde terapia electroconvulsiva o de electroshock, ... 01:50:07:07 Hab\u00eda sido enfermera de y fu\u00ed directora de enfermer\u00eda. 01:50:10:18 Fui e nfermera en una unidad de trasplante de coraz\u00f3n, pulm\u00f3n, h\u00edgado y ri\u00f1\u00f3n, y nunca apreci\u00e9 la importancia de la alimentaci\u00f3n. 01:50:14:28 Nunca entend\u00ed su prop\u00f3sito. 01:50:16:29 Y justo me enfermo despu\u00e9s de la Guerra del Golfo, y no pod\u00eda creer que nada d e la medicina tradicional pod\u00eda sanarme, nada. 01:50:24:11 Por eso tuve que considerar las medicinas alternativa e integrativa. 01:50:28:16 Los veteranos de la Guerra del Golfo se enfermaban justo despu\u00e9s de la guerra. 01:50:31:17 Miles, miles de ellos se iban enfermando. 01:50:34:13 Y no sab\u00edamos a qui\u00e9n recurrir. 01:50:37:03 Nos enteramos de que algunos veteranos de la Guerra del Golfo se hab\u00edan mejorado consumiendo alimentos crudos, vegetales, frutas, y jugos. 01:50:43:29 Y yo aprend\u00ed de eso. 01:50:46:10 Pero no fue sino hasta despu\u00e9s que me di cuenta de que realmente ha sido un hecho crucial en mi vida el ir al Centro de Restauraci\u00f3n de Charlotte Gerson en San Diego. 01:50:56:10 Y eso fue lo que en realidad me hizo entender la importancia de lo que comemos y bebemos. The Beautiful Truth 149 01:51:00:17 STEVE KROSCHEL: Cuando surgi\u00f3 el tema de las vacunas, Garrett comparti\u00f3 su opini\u00f3n sobre las vacunas administradas a beb\u00e9s y ni\u00f1os de edad escolar. 01:51:08:04 Hubo una disminuci\u00f3n del 90% de las enfermedades antes de que existieran las vacunas, como lo muestran claramente los gr\u00e1ficos. 01:51:14:24 Fue una mejor nutrici\u00f3n lo que caus\u00f3 esa diminuci\u00f3n, no las vacunas. 01:51:19:08 Las vacunas son neurot\u00f3xicas. 01:51:21:24 Y por esa raz\u00f3n y conocimiento, el chico tiene u na firme opini\u00f3n al respecto. 01:51:37:29 HOWARD STRAUS: Los alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente modificados son literalmente letales. 01:51:42:06 STEVE KROSCHEL: Fue aqu\u00ed en San Francisco donde el chico tuvo la suerte de conocer al Director Ejecutivo del Centro par a la Seguridad Alimentaria, Andrew Kimbrell. 01:51:51:26 El Centro para la Seguridad Alimentaria es una organizaci\u00f3n nacional sin fines de lucro dedicada a proteger a los consumidores y al medio ambiente de los peligros de las da\u00f1inas tecnolog\u00edas de produ cci\u00f3n de alimentos, y a promover la agricultura org\u00e1nica y de otras formas sostenibles. 01:52:07:08 ANDREW KIMBRELL: Una de las creencias m\u00e1s err\u00f3neas que tenemos sobre los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos es que son como una caja de pandora. 01:52:11:19 Escuchamo s todo el tiempo que el 60% o 70% de los alimentos contienen ingredientes gen\u00e9ticamente modificados. 01:52:17:09 Eso no es verdad; es el 60% de los alimentos procesados que contiene ingredientes gen\u00e9ticamente modificados. 01:52:22:18 En realidad, casi ni ng\u00fan alimento no procesado est\u00e1 gen\u00e9ticamente modificado. 01:52:25:21 Ninguna fruta, ning\u00fan vegetal, ni la carne, ni el pescado, ni la mayor\u00eda de los derivados l\u00e1cteos contienen ingredientes gen\u00e9ticamente modificados. 01:52:32:22 De hecho, hay solamente cuatro cultivos que son gen\u00e9ticamente modificados: ma\u00edz, algod\u00f3n, canola y soya. 01:52:37:29 Nosotros hemos frenado totalmente al trigo, arroz y pescado gen\u00e9ticamente modificados y hemos puesto un alto a las bio - farmac\u00e9uticas. 01:52:44:27 Estamos viendo que, en realidad, los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos son uno de los mayores fracasos de la agricultura moderna que han sido rechazados alrededor del mundo, y no solamente podemos detenerlos, los estamos deteniendo. 01:52:54:18 ANDREW KIMBRELL: Hay cinco empresas que fabrican OMGs (Organismos Gen\u00e9ticamente Modificados). 01:52:57:00 Tenemos a Monsanto, Dupont, Behr, Segenta y Dow. 01:53:03:04 Esas son las cinco grandes empresas que producen alimentos transg\u00e9nicos. The Beautiful Truth 150 01:53:06:04 Y todas tienen algo en com\u00fan: no son empresas agr\u00edcolas, son empresas qu\u00edmicas. 01:53:11:22 Y hay una raz\u00f3n para eso. 01:53:13:09 La ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica hoy en d\u00eda significa una sola cosa - no eso que promocionan, los mitos sobre abundancia, alimentos m\u00e1s nutritivos y de mejor sabor - todo eso es disparate de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. 01:53:22:00 Estas empresas qu\u00edmicas han manipulado gen\u00e9ticamente estos cultivos para que sean m\u00e1s resistentes a sus herbicidas y pesticidas. 01:53:27:19 Y con eso venden otros cientos de millones de toneladas m\u00e1s de sus qu\u00edmicos. 01:53:31:00 Ese es su prop\u00f3sito. 01:53:32:02 ANDREW KIMBRELL: No me sorprende que Monsanto no haya dado una entrevista para esta pel\u00edcula. 01:53:35:29 Monsanto ha desarrollado la tecnolog\u00eda con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de vender m\u00e1s de sus prop ios herbicidas. 01:53:44:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett hab\u00eda completado su tarea sobre este tema, que le pareci\u00f3 muy importante e inquietante. 01:54:09:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: \"Monsanto no deber\u00eda tener que garantizar la seguridad de los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos, nuestro inter\u00e9s es vender tanto como sea posible. Garantizar su seguridad es el trabajo de la FDA.\" 01:54:20:13 Pero a Garrett le pareci\u00f3 \u00e9sto inquietante y confuso. 01:54:23:02 En un libro recientemente publicado, el chico ley\u00f3 otro argumento. 01:54:26: 27 GARRETT: \"A fin de cuentas, es el productor de los alimentos quien debe garantizar la seguridad\". 01:54:31:24 BETH HARRISON: En realidad depende de la buena voluntad de las compa\u00f1\u00edas biotecnol\u00f3gicas el entregar estudios al gobierno. 01:54:39:23 Pero en su mayor\u00eda, \u00e9sta es una industria no regulada, y de ah\u00ed nos alimentamos. 01:54:44:04 ANDREW KIMBRELL: Una de las m\u00e1s grandes preguntas de la gente es: \"\u00bfLos alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente modificados son letales? \u00bfSon t\u00f3xicos?\" 01:54:48:29 Y la FDA nos dio u na respuesta. 01:54:51:15 La Agencia de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA) nos ha dado la respuesta. 01:54:53:10 En los a\u00f1os 80 y 90, examinaron estos alimentos y dijeron: \"S\u00ed, el proceso de ingenier\u00eda gen\u00e9tica puede hacer que un alimento no t\u00f3xico se vuelva t\u00f3xico\". 01:55:00:27 Este proceso puede crear nuevos al\u00e9rgenos. 01:55:02:24 Puede disminuir los nutrientes en los alimentos. 01:55:04:09 Puede disminuir nuestra respuesta inmune. 01:55:06:15 Y en ciertos casos, incluso hemos visto que estos alimentos tienen el potencial de causar c\u00e1ncer ... esta tecnolog\u00eda. The Beautiful Truth 151 01:55:12:05 As\u00ed que ya tenemos la respuesta sobre si los alimentos transg\u00e9nicos son letales o t\u00f3xicos. 01:55:16:21 S\u00ed, el mismo proceso puede crear un alimento saludable y convertirlo en t\u00f3xico y potencialmente letal. 01:55:22:25 ANDREW KIMBRELL: El objetivo de Monsanto es evidente. 01:55:24:20 Monsanto se ha convertido en el mayor productor de semillas en el mundo. 01:55:28:07 Monsanto est\u00e1 tratando de comprar todas las semillas del mundo para despu\u00e9s patentarlas y controlarlas, de modo que los agricultores no puedan conservar semilla alguna. 01:55:37:16 Y cuando ellos modifiquen gen\u00e9ticamente esas semillas, lo que quieren es ponerles algo llamado \"tecnolog\u00eda exterminadora\". 01:55:42:23 Esto h ace que las semillas se \"suiciden\" despu\u00e9s de una temporada de cultivo y as\u00ed los agricultores no puedan conservarlas. 01:55:48:18 Entonces, lo que Monsanto quiere hacer es controlar todas las semillas del mundo, y asegurarse de que ning\u00fan agricultor pueda conservarlas. 01:55:57:11 Esto es algo extremadamente importante porque el 80% de los agricultores del mundo dependen de la conservaci\u00f3n de semillas para sobrevivir. 01:56:06:00 Si Monsanto - ya sea con patentes o usando su tecnolog\u00eda exterminadora - logra destruir la capacidad de los agricultores de conservar semillas, el resultado ser\u00eda una hambruna masiva. 01:56:16:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett se sorprendi\u00f3 al enterarse de que el control de plagas y el uso de qu\u00edmicos por otros motivos, incluyendo fert ilizantes artificiales, son cosas completamente innecesarias. 01:56:24:28 S\u00f3lo en los Estados Unidos, hay docenas de instituciones tratando de dar a conocer los beneficios de la agricultura sostenible. 01:56:31:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: El Dr. Paul Hepperly nos demostr\u00f3, a trav\u00e9s de estudios y experimentos con semillas, la asombrosa forma como las plantas sobreviven y superan a los cultivos qu\u00edmico -dependientes. 01:56:42:12 En muchos casos, las cosechas superan ampliamente a las de las granjas donde se utilizan qu\u00edmicos. 01:56:46:26 Los estudios son numerosos, repetitivos e inspiradores para cualquiera que aprecie la buena salud. 01:56:53:03 Seg\u00fan Dr. Gerson, la tierra es nuestro metabolismo externo. 01:56:57:08 \u00c9sta debe estar libre de aerosoles y venenos pa ra que el cuerpo pueda sanarse. 01:57:11:16 STEVE KROSCHEL: Debido a la agricultura qu\u00edmica, el agua que sale del grifo puede contener mucho m\u00e1s que s\u00f3lo fl\u00faor y cloro. 01:57:21:05 STEVE KROSCHEL: Y existe otro proceso aplicado a los alimentos que podr\u00eda ser peligroso para la salud. The Beautiful Truth 152 01:57:26:01 ANDREW KIMBRELL: Hemos descubierto que la irradiaci\u00f3n de alimentos no s\u00f3lo mata las bacterias, raz\u00f3n por la cual se la utiliza, sino que tambi\u00e9n cambia los alimentos a nivel molecular. 01:57:35:04 En los alimento s se crea algo llamado \"radicales libres\". 01:57:38:02 Son elementos moleculares nuevos en los alimentos que nunca antes hab\u00edan estado ah\u00ed. 01:57:42:03 Por ejemplo, en alimentos t\u00edpicos hemos visto que se produce benceno, un conocido carcin\u00f3geno. 01:57:4 8:27 Hemos visto muchos otros elementos t\u00f3xicos en los alimentos producidos por la irradiaci\u00f3n, ya que \u00e9sta altera esos alimentos en su esencia. 01:57:56:07 ANDREW KIMBRELL: Lo que, yo creo, ahora entendemos sobre nuestra crisis alimentaria, es que no s\u00f3 lo se trata de una crisis donde desaparecen granjas, no es s\u00f3lo una crisis ambiental. 01:58:03:23 No es s\u00f3lo una crisis nutricional. 01:58:05:14 Es tambi\u00e9n una crisis \u00e9tica. 01:58:07:08 Cada decisi\u00f3n que tomamos sobre los alimentos que compramos, comemos y cultivamos, cambia nuestro sistema agr\u00edcola y el destino de los 10.000 millones de animales utilizados y cruelmente tratados cada a\u00f1o en nuestro sistema alimentario. 01:58:20:28 Por eso, tenemos la responsabilidad moral de comer saludablemente. 01:58:2 4:22 ANDREW KIMBRELL: La hermosa verdad es que la gente alrededor del mundo esta diciendo \"No\" a los alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente modificados y \"No\" a la irradiaci\u00f3n. 01:58:29:15 Est\u00e1n diciendo \"No\" a los aditivos alimentarios y \"S\u00ed\" a los alimentos org\u00e1nicos y m\u00e1s que org\u00e1nicos. 01:58:34:10 Est\u00e1n diciendo \"S\u00ed\" a los alimentos producidos localmente a una escala apropiada, que es m\u00e1s humana, biodiversa y socialmente justa. 01:58:41:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett pens\u00f3 que una forma de en algo parar esto es con el voto, asumiendo que se puede confiar en las m\u00e1quinas de votar. 01:58:58:19 STEVE KROSCHEL: \u00bfC\u00f3mo es posible que un hombre que curaba el c\u00e1ncer y enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas hace m\u00e1s de 80 a\u00f1os fuera tan incomprendido? 01:59:04:19 Esto que ahora incluso para u n chico de 15 a\u00f1os resultaba f\u00e1cil de entender. 01:59:08:27 \u00bfSer\u00e1 ahora una carrera contra reloj para valorar el regalo que Gerson le ofreci\u00f3 al mundo hace mucho tiempo, antes de que sea demasiado tarde desde el punto de vista meramente ambiental? 01:59:2 7:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: En el transcurso de nuestro viaje, Garrett encontr\u00f3 un art\u00edculo en el peri\u00f3dico sobre la obesidad. The Beautiful Truth 153 01:59:32:03 Despu\u00e9s de lo que hab\u00eda aprendido, no fue nada sorprendente. 01:59:35:11 Con todos estos qu\u00edmicos y las ansias por m\u00e1s qu \u00edmicos, alimentos refinados y az\u00facar, estamos destinados a ser obesos y a morir as\u00ed. 02:00:00:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: El valle de Ohio es la capital mundial en la fabricaci\u00f3n ata\u00fades. 02:00:03:28 L\u00f3gicamente, el chico se hab\u00eda preguntado qu\u00e9 pasa cuando el cad\u00e1ver es de gran tama\u00f1o. 02:00:08:28 La compa\u00f1ia de ata\u00fades Goliath, un negocio familiar, esta teniendo mucho \u00e9xito, el cual Garrett atribuye a las farmac\u00e9uticas, al GMS, aspartame, vacunas, irradiaci\u00f3n de alimentos, alimentos gen\u00e9ticamente modificados, am algamas dentales, fl\u00faor en el agua, tratamiento de conductos, entre otros. 02:00:27:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Incluso el ata\u00fad de tama\u00f1o est\u00e1ndar es 2,5 cm m\u00e1s ancho de lo que sol\u00eda ser. 02:01:22:05 KEITH DAVIS: La mayor\u00eda de la gente no entrar\u00eda en uno porque les da miedo. 02:01:24:21 Es un mal augurio. 02:01:31:00 GARRETT: En realidad, esto ser\u00eda excelente para la caba\u00f1a en Alaska en el verano. 02:01:34:13 Podr\u00edas cerrar el ata\u00fad, no entrar\u00eda nada de luz y dormir\u00edas mejor. 02:01:45:19 KEITH DAVIS: Saca los dedos. 02:01:54:16 La mayor\u00eda de las personas no son m\u00e1s altas sino m\u00e1s anchas y gruesas. 02:01:58:24 Uno de los problemas que tenemos con las personas que sufren de sobrepeso, es que son muy anchas, y tambi\u00e9n mucho m\u00e1s gruesas. 02:02:09:10 Nuestros at a\u00fades tienen que ser dise\u00f1ados para ajustarse a este problema. 02:02:12:27 Adem\u00e1s, cuando piden una cremaci\u00f3n, en muchas ocasiones no pueden hacerla porque las puertas de los crematorios no son tan grandes. 02:02:21:26 Y cuando pueden hacerlo, tienen que tener mucho cuidado al procesar el cuerpo en el crematorio para evitar un incendio; debido al exceso de fluidos corporales combustibles que pueden hacer que el el crematorio tambi\u00e9n se queme. 02:02:35:04 Han habido varios accidentes en que los fluidos co rporales se han encendido y han hecho que el crematorio se incendie. 02:02:41:21 Esto sucedi\u00f3 en Columbus y en Indian\u00e1polis. 02:02:50:20 STEVE KROSCHEL: Despues de tanto viajar, ya era hora de parar. 02:03:07:12 Fuimos a la casa de la abuela materna de Garrett. 02:03:13:14 La madre de Garrett muri\u00f3 hace un a\u00f1o y ocho meses en un extra\u00f1o accidente. The Beautiful Truth 154 02:03:29:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Todos los seres vivos tienen un campo propio de energ\u00eda que los rodea que puede ser medido e incluso fotografiado. 02:03:35:00 Garrett record\u00f3 un experimento con un ingeniero aeroespacial llamado Christopher Wodtke antes de empezar este viaje. 02:03:41:27 En esta toma, este ingeniero demuestra una comparaci\u00f3n entre una rebanada de zanahoria org\u00e1nica cocida y otra cruda. 02:03:49:19 La zanahoria cocida est\u00e1 a la izquierda. 02:03:51:24 Y la cruda a la derecha. 02:03:54:10 La zanahoria cruda tiene una deslumbrante l\u00ednea de fuerte energ\u00eda que no muestra la zanahoria que fue cocida al vapor durante 10 minutos. 02:04:03:27 \u00c9sto signif ica que los alimentos pasteurizados est\u00e1n muertos. 02:04:07:19 Garrett le hizo un funeral a la \u00faltima v\u00edctima, la almendra. 02:04:21:22 STEVE KROSCHEL: Nosotros repetimos el experimento con un trozo de manzana inorg\u00e1nica y otro de manzana org\u00e1nica. 02:04 :27:20 Los resultados fueron menos notorios, pero el trozo de manzana de la derecha es org\u00e1nico. 02:04:33:02 El de la izquierda inorg\u00e1nico. 02:04:49:13 Un tomate org\u00e1nico. 02:04:56:09 Un tomate inorg\u00e1nico. 02:04:58:26 Esta t\u00e9cnica fotogr\u00e1fica usa 50.0 00 voltios y un amplio rango de frecuencias que resuenan con los objetos de prueba, capturando sus patrones para an\u00e1lisis, est\u00e9n vivos o no. 02:05:11:28 Los resultados fueron consistentes y fascinantes para el chico; un \u00e1rea de estudio que necesita un an\u00e1 lisis detallado. 02:05:26:19 CHRISTOPHER WODTKE: Hacer ciencia significa analizar las cosas usando n\u00fameros. 02:05:30:12 Cuando se puede poner medidas a las cosas, se puede crear ciencia. 02:05:35:19 La fotograf\u00eda \"Kirlian\" es la iridolog\u00eda del futuro co n la que se puede ver marcas en el aura que rodea al cuerpo humano, y estas marcas indican donde hay problemas de salud y donde la salud esta bien. 02:05:58:28 STEVE KROSCHEL: Todo el trabajo que Garrett hab\u00eda hecho finalmente estaba tomando forma. 02:06: 05:14 Su estudio sobre la terapia Gerson estaba por completarse. 02:06:09:26 La terapia Gerson no es un secreto - nunca lo ha sido - y s\u00ed funciona. 02:06:13:29 Es sencilla, pero requiere obediencia y dedicaci\u00f3n. 02:06:17:18 B\u00e1sicamente, consiste en con sumir jugos org\u00e1nicos reci\u00e9n exprimidos, deliciosas comidas org\u00e1nicas y claro, caf\u00e9, pero en enemas. 02:06:32:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: Dr. Gerson dio el ejemplo de 50 pacientes recuperados en su libro original a finales de la d\u00e9cada de1950, representativos de m iles de pacientes recuperados en ese tiempo. The Beautiful Truth 155 02:06:42:07 Todos los pacientes fueron diagnosticados en base a minuciosos registros m\u00e9dicos en los principales centros m\u00e9dicos de todo el pa\u00eds. 02:06:48:11 Durante y despu\u00e9s del tratamiento, las historias cl\u00ed nicas de centros m\u00e9dicos independientes confirman los resultados, y \u00e9stos a su vez confirman una hermosa verdad. 02:07:02:15 STEVE KROSCHEL: Gerson cur\u00f3 a su buen amigo, el Dr. Albert Schweitzer de la diabetes de adulto, y despu\u00e9s a su esposa de tuberculo sis pulmonar, y despu\u00e9s a su hija de una rara enfermedad de la piel. 02:07:11:25 Es algo que Schweitzer nunca olvidar\u00eda, y ellos intercambiaron cartas hasta la muerte de Gerson en 1959. 02:07:20:12 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett pens\u00f3 que la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n que pod\u00eda explicar por qu\u00e9 el p\u00fablico en general nunca ha o\u00eddo hablar de esta terapia es esto: (informaci\u00f3n detallada en forma escrita en el video). 02:07:30:00 El chico est\u00e1 seguro de que muchas personas famosas y talentosas habr\u00edan cambiado la historia y cultu ra si tan s\u00f3lo hubieran sabido. 02:07:37:03 CHARLOTTE GERSON: Garrett, en cuanto a la pregunta sobre la funci\u00f3n del p\u00e1ncreas, b\u00e1sicamente lo que hace es digerir los alimentos. 02:07:44:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: El p\u00e1ncreas desempe\u00f1a un papel muy importante en l a terapia Gerson; est\u00e1 claro que el tracto intestinal humano es m\u00e1s largo que el de los carn\u00edvoros. 02:07:54:15 La digesti\u00f3n en los humanos se ve muy afectada cuando se come prote\u00edna animal, sobrecargando al p\u00e1ncreas y al tracto digestivo. 02:08:06:08 CHARLOTTE GERSON: Pero el p\u00e1ncreas tiene otro trabajo muy importante, que es proteger al cuerpo contra c\u00e9lulas malignas. 02:08:15:29 El p\u00e1ncreas detecta las c\u00e9lulas malignas si aparecen, las digiere, las mata, y se deshace de ellas. 02:08:24:16 Cuando se s obrecarga al p\u00e1ncreas, como lo hacen la mayor\u00eda de los norteamericanos con el exceso de alimentos con prote\u00edna animal, toda la capacidad del p\u00e1ncreas se usa tratando de digerir y deshacerse de este producto de origen animal, y no queda nada para protegerno s de las c\u00e9lulas malignas. 02:08:47:06 El sistema inmunol\u00f3gico se paraliza. 02:08:50:14 STEVE KROSCHEL: Luego el invitado esloveno le pregunt\u00f3 a Howard c\u00f3mo funciona el enema de caf\u00e9. 02:08:55:00 INVITADO ESLOVENO: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? 02:08:55:21 HOWARD STRAUS: Bueno, lo que pasa es que la cafe\u00edna en el enema de caf\u00e9 es absorbida por la vena hemorroidal, que est\u00e1 envuelta alrededor del colon descendente. 02:09:06:00 Es una vena; es un sistema de drenaje, no un sistema de distribuci\u00f3n como es una arteria. The Beautiful Truth 156 02:09:1 0:29 Es parte del sistema venoso portal que entonces lleva la cafe\u00edna directamente al h\u00edgado. 02:09:20:09 INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien. 02:09:20:22 HOWARD STRAUS: No s\u00f3lo la cafe\u00edna, sino tambi\u00e9n otros elementos del caf\u00e9: cafestol y kahweol. INVITADO Y potasio. 02:09:29:20 HOWARD STRAUS: Y potasio, muy importante, potasio. 02:09:31:28 INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien. 02:09:32:20 HOWARD STRAUS: Entonces, el h\u00edgado es estimulado para producir glutati\u00f3n S -transferasa y bilis. 02:09:41:12 La glutati\u00f3n S -transferasa es una enzima que limpia la sangre. 02:09:46:23 Y por supuesto, las compa\u00f1\u00edas farmac\u00e9uticas han querido producir algo que estimule la glutati\u00f3n S -transferasa, pero no pueden patentarla. 02:09:55:1 4 INVITADO ESLOVENO: Mmm. 02:09:56:13 HOWARD STRAUS: Porque si ellos pudieran purificar la sangre, ser\u00eda maravilloso, pero no pueden. 02:10:01:03 INVITADO ESLOVENO: Bien. 02:10:01:22 Entonces nosotros decimos: \"Enema de caf\u00e9, enema de caf\u00e9.\" 02:10:04:0 2 Y ellos nos dicen, \"Vete chico, que no podemos patentar eso\". 02:10:06:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: El enema de caf\u00e9 se prepara con tres cucharadas de caf\u00e9 org\u00e1nico molido que luego es hervido a fuego lento por 15 minutos. 02:10:14:12 Despu\u00e9s se lo vierte a tra v\u00e9s de un filtro en una jarra de un litro. 02:10:18:00 Luego se le a\u00f1ade agua destilada hasta completar el litro. 02:10:21:10 Y despu\u00e9s se lo vierte en una cubeta para enemas. 02:10:25:26 STEVE KROSCHEL: Una vez que el caf\u00e9 ha sido introducido en el pac iente, \u00e9ste se recuesta sobre su lado derecho con las rodillas dobladas por 10 a 13 minutos aproximadamente, y finalmente evacua. 02:10:36:26 Pero para realmente impresionar a Garrett a un nivel personal, el chico ten\u00eda que conocer a pacientes con c\u00e1ncer y asi convencerse. 02:10:44:23 No m\u00e1s fotos, ni libros. 02:10:47:13 Garrett quer\u00eda ir a M\u00e9xico. 02:11:15:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: El chico se sorprendi\u00f3 con lo agradable del entorno, y lo felices que parec\u00edan los pacientes con c\u00e1ncer. 02:11:21:11 Hab\u00eda pacie ntes de todas partes del mundo. 02:11:23:24 Garrett comi\u00f3 con ellos y escuch\u00f3 sus historias. 02:11:26:24 Uno de los m\u00e9dicos de la cl\u00ednica comparti\u00f3 una experiencia personal con Garrett sobre su trabajo como m\u00e9dico del equipo de grabaci\u00f3n de la pel\u00edcula T itanic de James Cameron rodada en M\u00e9xico. 02:11:42:04 STEVE KROSCHEL: Una paciente de Nueva Zelanda estaba ansiosa por conversar con Garrett. The Beautiful Truth 157 02:11:46:14 GARRETT: \u00bfCu\u00e1nto tiempo llevas aqu\u00ed? 02:11:48:13 PACIENTE FEMENINO: Tres semanas. 02:11:50:15 Vine directamente de la Cl\u00ednica Mayo de Florida. 02:11:54:18 Tengo melanoma en mis huesos, columna vertebral, pierna, h\u00edgado, pulmones y n\u00f3dulos. 02:12:03:07 Desde que estoy aqu\u00ed, me siento muy diferente por dentro, mucho m\u00e1s fuerte f\u00edsicamente, y ya no teng o nauseas. 02:12:13:00 He tenido algunos altibajos. 02:12:16:04 Se tienen ciertas reacciones mientras se est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed. 02:12:19:12 No he podido ser diagnosticada, ya que s\u00f3lo han pasado tres semanas, pero internamente me siento 100% mejor que cuando llegu\u00e9 . 02:12:26:20 Por cierto Garrett, cuando reci\u00e9n llegu\u00e9 aqu\u00ed hab\u00eda una persona a la que no le iba muy bien en la terapia. 02:12:32:22 Empez\u00f3 haciendo el 50% de \u00e9sta, y antes de irse ya hac\u00eda muy poco. 02:12:39:20 Yo le recomendar\u00eda a quien quiera hacer e sto, que complete el tratamiento, de lo contrario no funciona. 02:12:44:24 Eso incluye los jugos, los enemas, la dieta, todo. 02:12:48:17 As\u00ed es como en realidad funciona. 02:12:51:17 PACIENTE FEMENINO: Vine aqu\u00ed desde la cl\u00ednica Mayo donde me acababan de hacer radiaci\u00f3n. 02:12:57:04 Me dijeron que ten\u00eda de cuatro a seis meses de vida si no hac\u00eda la quimio. 02:13:01:15 Y si hac\u00eda la quimio, tendr\u00eda de seis a ocho meses de vida, con lo que ten\u00eda. 02:13:05:22 Si la quimio era de la mejor, y si yo respon d\u00eda bien, tal vez vivir\u00eda un a\u00f1o. 02:13:10:16 Entonces, analizando esas opciones, mejor decid\u00ed buscar algo m\u00e1s. 02:13:14:10 Mi hermana viaj\u00f3 para verme y estaba leyendo el libro de Angola sobre de su recuperaci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer. 02:13:20:19 Angola era un ho mbre con c\u00e1ncer de huesos, y le dieron dos semanas de vida. 02:13:24:17 Y despu\u00e9s de seguir la terapia Gerson por varios meses y luego adaptarla, \u00e9l sigue con vida y ahora tiene la fundaci\u00f3n Angola en Australia. 02:13:35:09 Conf\u00edo en la terapia con mi vi da, por eso estoy aqu\u00ed. 02:13:37:21 M\u00c9DICO: Al hablar con la se\u00f1ora Gerson y hablar... 02:13:39:09 STEVE KROSCHEL: Luego Howard y Garrett hablaron con uno de los m\u00e9dicos de la cl\u00ednica. 02:13:42:20 M\u00c9DICO: ... ambos casos que tenemos. 02:13:43:28 qu\u00e9 es lo que ve? 02:13:45:00 \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que ve en los primeros d\u00edas? 02:13:47:01 M\u00c9DICO: En los primeros d\u00edas, usando los enemas de caf\u00e9, empec\u00e9 a notar cambios. 02:13:51:24 Su dolor empieza a disminuir y su energ\u00eda aumenta. The Beautiful Truth 158 02:13:54:21 A los pacientes que vienen aqu\u00ed, lo primero que les disminuye es la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea. 02:13:57:06 La presi\u00f3n alta desaparece en la primera semana. 02:13:59:15 Adi\u00f3s a las medicinas para la presi\u00f3n alta. 02:14:02:13 Y los pacientes no se dan cuenta de que a qu\u00ed hay algo m\u00e1s que s\u00f3lo enemas de caf\u00e9, desintoxicaci\u00f3n, dieta org\u00e1nica y jugos. 02:14:08:06 Ellos empiezan a ver los cambios, tal como yo empiezo a creer en lo que ellos esperan (palabras ilegibles). 02:14:13:18 Y yo les digo: \"Es algo m\u00e1s que esperan es una realidad\". 02:14:16:13 HOWARD STRAUS: Realidad. 02:14:17:00 M\u00c9DICO: Y empieza a cambiar su manera de vivir. 02:14:18:23 HOWARD STRAUS: Y usted, como m\u00e9dico, debe sentir una gran satisfacci\u00f3n. 02:14:22:24 M\u00c9DICO: Es fant\u00e1stico. 02:14:23:27 Es incre\u00edble ver cambios en los ex\u00e1menes de sangre y rayos X. 02:14:27:28 Algo que puedo tocar, sentir, porque veo a estos pacientes todos los d\u00edas. 02:14:33:20 STEVE KROSCHEL: Desde Tijuana, Garrett viaj\u00f3 hacia el sur a visitar a una paciente de c\u00e1ncer qu e se estaba recuperando contra todo pron\u00f3stico con la terapia Gerson en su casa. 02:14:43:00 En las monta\u00f1as, en las afueras de San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas, Howard Straus llev\u00f3 a Garrett a conocer a esta paciente quien ten\u00eda la misma edad que Garrett. 02:14:52:05 Su nombre era Lupita. 02:15:12:02 STEVE KROSCHEL: Lupita super\u00f3 un raro tipo de c\u00e1ncer femenino usando la terapia Gerson en condiciones extremadamente dif\u00edciles asombrando a su m\u00e9dico y demostrando a Garrett que todo es posible cuando se tiene fe. 02:15:35:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: Para Lupita, no es dif\u00edcil encontrar verduras y frutas org\u00e1nicas frescas. 02:15:42:12 Ir\u00f3nicamente, en los Estados Unidos es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil conseguir productos org\u00e1nicos. 02:16:03:11 STEVE KROSCHEL: Las pruebas de laboratorio de los pacientes son exhaustivas y supervisadas cuidadosamente. 02:16:07:08 La mayor\u00eda de los pacientes s\u00f3lo permanecen en la cl\u00ednica de una a tres semanas, y luego van a casa a recuperarse. 02:16:11:26 Un estudio sobre la terapia Gerson encontr\u00f3 que es 10 0% exitosa con el melanoma en la etapa uno y dos. 02:16:18:19 80% en la etapa tres y 39% en la etapa cuatro. 02:16:23:28 De los pacientes con cualquier tipo de c\u00e1ncer en etapa terminal, desahuciados por la medicina ortodoxa, el 39% a\u00fan se recupera, inclu yendo los que tienen c\u00e1ncer de p\u00e1ncreas, el cual tiene menos del 1% de tasa de supervivencia usando la medicina convencional. 02:16:37:23 STEVE KROSCHEL: El Instituto Gerson de San Diego cuenta con extensos archivos de casos que son de acceso p\u00fablico. The Beautiful Truth 159 02:16:45:12 ISSA KHALAF: 12 meses despu\u00e9s de que me diagnosticaron c\u00e1ncer de pr\u00f3stata, qued\u00e9 completamente curado, en 12 meses. 02:16:52:10 Eso se comprob\u00f3 con IRM (imagen de resonancia magn\u00e9tica) y otras pruebas de im\u00e1genes que me hicieron y que mostraban que el c\u00e1ncer hab\u00eda desaparecido completamente. 02:17:02:20 De mi hueso sacro, pelvis, h\u00edgado y pr\u00f3stata. 02:17:08:18 32 meses despu\u00e9s del diagn\u00f3stico, me hice una segunda IRM, la que re -confirm\u00f3 que el c\u00e1ncer hab\u00eda desaparecido completamente de todas la s partes de mi cuerpo. 02:17:20:24 ISSA KHALAF: Y si alguien lo duda, tengo toda mi historia cl\u00ednica que lo demuestra. 02:17:25:03 Traje la historia cl\u00ednica conmigo, desde los reportes m\u00e9dicos de los escaneos hasta las im\u00e1genes para demostrar sin ninguna duda. 02:17:34:29 Es simplemente algo incre\u00edble. 02:17:36:07 STEVE KROSCHEL: Los informes de patolog\u00eda hablan por s\u00ed mismos. 02:17:52:00 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett encontr\u00f3 pacientes curados por todas partes, con pruebas de sus doctores. 02:17:56:27 MUJER : La terapia Gerson cur\u00f3 mi fibromialgia. 02:18:00:18 STEVE KROSCHEL: Entonces le mostr\u00e9 a Garrett un video de hace casi cinco a\u00f1os de una paciente deshauciada por la medicina convencional. 02:18:08:26 Ella ten\u00eda carcinoma peritoneal primario extraov\u00e1ric o, etapa cuatro. 02:18:15:10 Nunca nadie se hab\u00eda recuperado de \u00e9ste tipo de c\u00e1ncer con medicina ortodoxa. 02:18:21:14 All\u00ed estaba ella, usando la terapia Gerson como su \u00faltima opci\u00f3n. 02:18:28:24 STEVE KROSCHEL: Y ahora, cinco a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Garrett estaba viendo los resultados. 02:18:35:14 \u00bfAcaso estaba leyendo el obituario de la mujer? 02:18:38:19 Su historia es la siguiente. 02:18:43:06 MUJER: El doctor sali\u00f3 del cuarto y se fue al final del pasillo por un rato. 02:18:48:12 Luego regres\u00f3, cruz\u00f3 su s manos frente a su pecho, y con asombro me mir\u00f3 y me dijo: \"T\u00fa eres la \u00fanica paciente que hemos visto que ha sobrevivido a este diagn\u00f3stico.\" 02:19:02:15 Dijo: \"Esto es inaudito\". 02:19:05:08 As\u00ed que le dije que si alguna vez se llegara a enfermar, me llame. 02:19:13:06 Y yo lo ayudar\u00eda. 02:19:14:25 STEVE KROSCHEL: Garrett quer\u00eda m\u00e1s pruebas, por lo que le pidi\u00f3 a la paciente que vaya a la Cl\u00ednica Mayo y obtenga un certificado del doctor que la diagnostic\u00f3 donde diga que fue la terapia Gerson la que la cur\u00f3.
