We show how uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations require a rethinking to center and lacks standardization. We aimed to evaluate this variability via an vasospasm diagnosis and endovascular management.We evaluate practice patterns neurologists via email and via professional societies - the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery questions.A total of 201 physicians (25% [50/201] USA and 75% non-USA) completed the survey over 10 months, 42% had >7years of experience, 92% were male, median was centers were represented. Daily transcranial Doppler was the most common screening method (75%) for vasospasm. In cases of symptomatic medical treatment was directly considered by 58% of physicians. The most common reason to initiate endovascular treatment was clinical deficits associated with proven vasospasm/DCI in 89%. The choice of endovascular treatment and its efficacy was highly variable.

Papers focusing on late window AIS undergoing EVT imaged CTP NCCT were primary outcome of There were comparable rates of functional independence of functional independence after late window EVT was not more common in patients selected by over due to the disappearance of salvageable ischemic brain tissue (ie, the penumbra).Objective: To study the association between stroke onset-to-imaging time and penumbral volume in patients multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022. To limit selection bias, patients were selected from (1) the prospective registries of comprehensive centers with systematic use and (2) 1 thrombectomy study in which MRI with perfusion was acquired per protocol but treatment decisions were made adequate quality automated software, was defined as the volume of tissue with critical hypoperfusion (time to maximum >6 seconds) minus the volume of the ischemic core.

Despite this, a substantial percentage of patients have notable penumbra in extended time windows; the findings of this study suggest that a large proportion of patients with large vessel occlusion may benefit from therapeutic interventions. details (MeVO) an ongoing diagnostic challenge in which the added value of AI remains unclear.To assess the diagnostic performance of AI platforms for detecting occlusions.Studies that report the diagnostic performance AI-based of M2 occlusions (version 16 IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) was used to conduct all analyses.Eight studies with a low risk of bias and significant heterogeneity were included in estimates of of AI platforms for M2 occlusion detection were 64% (95% CI, 53 to 74%) and 97% (95% CI, 84 to 100%), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) in the SROC curve was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.83).The current performance of the AI-based algorithm makes as an adjunctive confirmatory rather than as an independent one for M2 occlusions. With the rapid development of such algorithms, it is anticipated that newer generations often retrospectively analysed data acute with a large vessel occlusion transferred for thrombectomy from a primary stroke center to one of three French comprehensive stroke centers, with an MRI obtained at both the primary and comprehensive center before thrombectomy. Inter-hospital IG rate was defined as the difference in infarct volumes on diffusion-weighted imaging between the primary and comprehensive center, divided by the delay between the two MRI scans. The primary outcome was identification of The hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR), a surrogate blood flow, was automatically measured on perfusion imaging.RESULTS: A total of 233 patients were included, of whom 27% patients were fast progressors. The percentage of fast was 3% among patients HIR<0.40 and 71% among with HIR0.40.

Outcomes interest included 90-day modified with IVT. Both treatments resulted in comparable rates of mRS 0-2 (RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.88-1.04; p-value = 0.282), sICH p-value = 0.253), mortality at 90-days (RR = 1.06, CI = 0.88-1.28; p-value = 0.529), and distal embolization (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.79-1.52; p-value = 0.572). MT alone was associated with a lower rate of TICI 2b-3 compared to MT with IVT 0.96, CI = 0.93-0.99; p-value = 0.006).CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of six RCTs, MT alone was comparable to MT plus IVT for mRS 0-2, sICH, mortality, and distal embolization; benefit from MT plus IVT and to increase the power of future meta-analyses.

We performed an updated systematic review with 988 EVT arm and 432 patients in the MEDT arm, were in the Future studies should better define patients morbidity, mortality, and intensive care unit length of stay for these patients. DCI is strongly associated with cerebral arterial vasospasm, reduced cerebral blood flow and cerebral infarction. The current standard treatment with intravenous or intra-arterial calcium channel antagonist and balloon angioplasty or stent has limited efficacy. A simple treatment such as a cervical sympathetic block (CSB) may be an of the cervical sympathetic trunk, which temporarily blocks the innervation of the cerebral arteries to cause arterial vasodilatation. CSB is a local, minimally invasive, low cost and safe technique that can the bedside offer significant in humans studies in this review show promising results for a CSB as a treatment for vasospasm/DCI. research is required to standardize the ischemic of in in (0-6 symptom onset) and late be optimized for we describe common modalities algorithms patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), and is associated with cerebral arterial vasospasm (CAV). Current treatments for CAV are expensive, invasive, and have limited efficacy. Cervical sympathetic provide the preclinical and human literature pertinent to CSB in the Reviews, Cochrane Central Controlled Trials, Science identify abstracts, conference proceedings, and to cervical sympathectomy and CAV in animal/adult patients.We included six human and six experimental studies. Human studies were mostly prospective observational, subtraction angiography showed an that may a option for treatment and prevention of CAV/DCI in cerebral ischemic brain tissue. We hypothesized that HIR correlates the risk of PH after EVT.METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients with vessel occlusion who underwent EVT between 2013 and 2021 at one of the 2 comprehensive stroke centers (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany and Stanford University School of Medicine, CA). HIR was automatically calculated on computed tomography perfusion studies volume (Tmax) delay >10 s Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2.RESULTS: A 624 patients met the inclusion after EVT. for based on the presence of ischemic hypoattenuation normal, the degree of reflects net biomarker stroke as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-3 day 90. of recanalization on functional outcome was analyzed according NWU within the early infarct lesion.RESULTS: 254 patients were included, of which 148 (58%) underwent MT.

Artificial intelligence platforms to assist with automated aneurysm detection are of high interest. We determined the performance of a semi-automated artificial intelligence software program (RAPID Aneurysm) for the detection of cerebral aneurysms.MATERIALS AND METHODS: RAPID Aneurysm was used to detect retrospectively the presence of cerebral aneurysms in CTA studies performed between January 2019 and December 2020. The gold standard was aneurysm presence and location as determined by the RAPID Aneurysm were determined.RESULTS: 51 patients (mean age, 5615; 24 women [47.1%]) with a single CTA were included. A total of 60 aneurysms were identified. RAPID Aneurysm had a sensitivity of (95% cerebral aneurysm detection.CONCLUSIONS: RAPID Aneurysm is highly accurate for the detection of cerebral aneurysms on and elegant and complex cerebrovascular bed providing redundant supply to the brain.

These treatment delays are common, and it is important to identify factors that mitigate the progression of the core in order to maximize the preservation of salvageable brain tissue. Collateral blood flow is the strongest factor known to influence ischemic core growth, which vessels, tissue-level vessels, and venous outflow. Collateral blood levels may by specific and would well as identify those patients in whom transfer may be futile. Here we review collateral blood flow and its relationship to ischemic core growth in stroke study the ADAPT technique and stent retrievers in the treatment of AIS were included.

ENI was defined as improvement of 8 points or a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 0 hour or 1 24 hours after treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were used to determine the association of collateral biomarkers with ENI and good (OR: 3.1, CI 1.7 to 5.8; p<0.001) were associated with ENI, but favourable TLC were not (p=0.431). Good functional outcomes at 90-days were associated with CI 1.4 to 3.6; p=0.001), VO 5.7, CI 3.5 to 9.3; ENI (OR: 5.7, CI 3.3 to 9.8; p<0.001), but not PAC status (p=0.647).Favourable PAC and VO were associated with ENI after thrombectomy. Favourable TLC predicted longer term functional recovery after thrombectomy, the impact of TLC on ENI is strongly dependent on vessel of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation (AC-LVO). The evidence for MT treatment of posterior circulation large vessel occlusion (PC-LVO) is 90-day arm 1612 the PC-LVO arm, were included. AC-LVO flow have significantly better outcomes than patients with poor collateral circulation. The purpose of to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) based on collateral its effectiveness in ischemic stroke patients with poor based collateral status. The study was performed over a lifetime horizon with a societal perspective in the US setting. Base-case analysis was done for good, intermediate, and poor patients with poor collaterals), which was equivalent to 1050, 771, and 734 days, respectively, in a health state characterized by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score also with good and intermediate collaterals. For patients poor higher and of $44,326/QALY. EVT was more cost-effective as long as it had better outcomes in absolute numbers in at least 4%-8% more patients than medical management.CONCLUSIONS: EVT treatment in early time for good outcome after ischemic stroke is cost-effective be excluded method anatomical carotid visible in least one run. Two neurointerventionalists labeled the carotid location (when visible) and vascular occlusions on 382 total individual DSA runs. For detecting the carotid terminus, positive and internal carotid scratch) under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic and pixel distance from the ground truth were calculated. The same training and analysis methods were used for arterial as patients with acute ischemic stroke due to status assessment mostly relies approach may provide deeper insights into the biology of collateral perfusion on medical imaging. Comprehensive collateralization is defined as blood flow of cerebral arteries through the brain tissue and into draining veins. We hypothesized that a comprehensive analysis of the cerebral collateral cascade (CCC) on an arterial, tissue and compared to CCC- profiles.Comprehensive The hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR) is associated with collateral status and reflects the impaired microperfusion of brain tissue in patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO). As a deterioration in cerebral blood flow is associated with brain edema, we aimed to investigate whether HIR is correlated with the early edema progression (EPR) determined by ischemic net thrombectomy automatically the ratio of time-to-maximum (TMax) > 10 s/(TMax) > 6 s.

Here, we provide an overview of changes in cerebral blood flow over childhood; and discuss the relevance and future in children are sharply differentiated from the common causes of adult AIS. A structured diagnostic approach will advanced brain imaging and trials, there is a conspicuous lack of data to guide selection of therapies and inform age-adjusted important AIS ischemic stroke relatively unsettling challenge, even the stroke specialist. that AIS assist localization ischemic brain in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO). We determined the association between vessel occlusion (PVO; internal carotid artery and proximal M1) and distal vessel occlusion (DVO; distal M1 and M2) and to assess collateral score. TLC were assessed on met inclusion criteria. 376 patients (58%) had PVO favorable which with good functional cervical or cerebral artery results in disruption of blood flow to the brain and may result in irreversible infarction. Intracranial pial collaterals are a network of arteries that may preserve blood flow to otherwise critically hypoperfused brain areas until vessel recanalization of these arterial collaterals is pivotal for the survivability of ischemic brain tissue and is associated with treatment success and clinical cascade in patients for the assessment of arterial collaterals, flow, and venous outflow. We also summarize how a more comprehensive assessment of the cerebral blood flow leads to a better prediction of treatment efficacy and ischemic stroke treatment and secondary prevention. The use of artificial intelligence, and in particular, deep learning, to synthesize large amounts of data and to understand better how clinical and imaging data can be leveraged to improve stroke care promises a new era of stroke care.

Results From 2007 to 2016, there were 16,279 patients cohort and 1775 patients in the cohorts ischemic stroke features in terms of outcome with acute ischemic stroke and to compare performance between multiple models and the Stroke Prognostication Using Age and National Institutes of Boosting machine learning models frequency of occurrence in the models. The model with the best performance was compared with the SPAN-100 index model using area under the receiver operating In 3 most biomarker 0.290.47. The the best-performing features had a better performance than the other machine learning models. The area under the curve of the model with the best-performing features was higher than SPAN-100 model and reached statistical significance for the total (P < .05) and the nonrecanalized patients (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based with higher with the best-performing features, especially advanced CTP data, had superior performance of recovery outcome prediction for patients with stroke middle-cerebral-artery Methods: Between May 2015 and March 2018, consecutive patients who underwent MT at one comprehensive stroke center and who had a baseline MRI with a T2* sequence were included. Clinical, procedural radiographic data, A total of patients included. 56% (35/62) had an A-SVS. Clots were significantly longer in the A-SVS group (19 mm vs. 8 mm p = 0.0002). Groups were otherwise well-matched with regard to baseline was difference in successful reperfusion after occlusion stroke have enrolled patients have salvageable brain tissue, who were randomly assigned beyond 6 h and (depending on study protocol) up to 24 h from time last seen well. We aimed to estimate the benefit of thrombectomy overall and in prespecified subgroups through individual patient data meta-analysis.We did a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis between Jan 1, 2010, and March of randomised controlled trials of endovascular From Randomized Studies Of Thrombectomy More Than outcome was disability on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days, analysed by ordinal logistic regression. Key safety outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and were included from six trials thrombectomy with an unadjusted common odds ratio (OR) of 242 (95% CI 176-333; p<00001) and an adjusted common to random assignment) 254 (183-354; p<00001). Thrombectomy was associated with higher rates of independence in activities of daily living (mRS 0-2) than best medical therapy alone (122 [459%] of 266 vs [193%] of 238; p<00001). No significant difference between when analysing either 90-day mortality (44 [165%] of 266 vs of 238) or symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (14 [53%] of 266 vs eight [33%] of 239). No heterogeneity of treatment effect baseline CT Score, and mode was stronger in patients randomly assigned for of with evidence of reversible cerebral ischaemia across the 6-24 h time window and are relevant to clinical practice. Our findings suggest that in thrombectomy should not be withheld on the basis of mode of presentation or of the point in time of presentation within the 6-24 h time window.Stryker Introduction: goal this study is to explore the impact of reperfusion and collateral status on infarct growth in the early and late time windows. Materials and Methods: Seventy patients CT days after (Late). Early infarct growth (between baseline and 24-h scans) and late infarct was assessed for each patient. The impact of collateral reperfusion 16.4-74.5) and median late infarct growth 6.7 ml (IQR -3.5-21.6) in the overall sample. Patients with DEFUSE the 24-h timepoint is too early assess full depend on are less defined. The degree of disability, presence of a large vessel occlusion with perfusion mismatch, and collateral circulation status may all be selecting patients for endovascular treatment. Identification of patients who are at risk for neurologic deterioration is critical to preventing poor most likely to remain stable on follow-up MRI were included, defined as those stroke functional outcomes than standard medical therapy The objective of analysis is to the late-window outcomes.Patients (n=182) who presented between 6 and 16 hours after they were last known to be well with therapy or standard medical therapy alone and followed-up through 90 days poststroke.

Purpose To of an anterior circulation LVO detection platform in a large mixed sample of individuals with and without LVO at cerebrovascular CT angiography (CTA). Materials and Methods In this retrospective from and 11 worldwide sites to balance demographic and technical artery LVO; these observers were blinded to all variables analysis platform was developed tested for location relative to reader consensus. Discordance between readers with respect to LVO presence or location was adjudicated by a blinded tertiary reader specificity, were conducted. Prespecified performance thresholds were set at a lower bound of the 95% CI of sensitivity and specificity of 0.8 or greater at mean times to notification of less than 3.5 minutes. Results A total of 217 study participants (mean age, 64 years 16 [standard deviation]; 116 positive curve was 99% (95% CI: 97, 100). Mean processing and notification time was 3 minutes 18 seconds. Conclusion The results the likely have as 0, not 2, full. Clinical and demographic data were from the electronic medical record. Using multivariable regression analyses, we determined the association between VO and (1) favorable TLC status (defined as hypoperfusion intensity ratio 0.4) and 66-84] years), Institutes of Scale (median, 12 for favorable TLC, age, glucose, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke triage, favorable VO profiles correlated with favorable TLC and were associated with outcomes after treatment. standard-of-care for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) of the anterior of to the functionality published between 2010 and reporting the use of mechanical thrombectomy and IV-tPA (MT+tPA) vs. MT alone for AIS treatment. The primary outcome was the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). A outcome measure. correct with 1,633 patients, 816 in the MT+tPA arm and 817 in the MT arm, were included in the meta-analysis. In each study, patient populations outcomes were adjudicated by an independent and blinded core laboratory. Compared to MT alone, compared to MT alone in patients treated for AIS, but a corresponding improvement in functional and safety outcomes was not present in this review. Further studies looking at the role of tPA before mechanical thrombectomy in different cohorts of patients could better clarify the role of tPA in the treatment protocol for AIS.

We determined the accuracy of RAPID ICH for ICH on NCCT.MATERIALS AND METHODS: ICH by RAPID ICH. Consensus detection of ICH by 3 neuroradiology experts was used as the criterion standard for RAPID ICH comparison. ICH volume was also automatically determined by RAPID hemorrhage and compared likelihood ratios by RAPID ICH were determined.RESULTS: We included 308 studies. RAPID ICH correctly identified 151/158 ICH cases CI 0.023-0.096) ICH were is highly accurate in the detection of ICH and in primary outcome was the relative change in creatinine level between baseline and 24 hours in the EVT versus medical arm. The secondary outcome was computed imaging selection the EVT arm. The safety outcome was a comparison of of for contrast-associated kidney injury in EVT versus medical and a comparison between CT versus magnetic resonance imaging selection at 24 hours (P<0.001). There was no difference in change between treatment groups: relative to baseline, there was a 6.3% reduction in the EVT group 9.2% P=0.294. 4 out of 91 (4.4%) versus 2/90 (2.2%) in the medical arm Perfusion imaging before EVT was not Stroke 2020. The predicted ischemic core (pCore) was defined as a reduction in cerebral blood flow (rCBF), while mismatch volume was defined using time to at discharge A total patients met the median 74.1mL ASCO score was associated with favorable at discharge (aOR 3.7, 95%CI 1.8 to 10.7, P=0.002), while no association was observed for the CTP model including the model (0.88 vs P=0.018).CONCLUSIONS: The ASCO score was superior to the CTP-based model for the prediction of good functional outcome and could represent a quick, practical, and easily implemented method for the selection of low ASPECTS patients most likely benefit from MT. View with occlusion of the internal carotid artery, the M1 or the M2 segments were included. Two observers assessed all CT images and one separate observer assessed DSA (reference standard) with static and dynamic (modified dynamic assessments. Concordance correlation coefficient (n = associated with modified Rankin Scale of 2 or less as were of CTA CTA 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6).CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between assessments on CT and DSA was poor. Collateral status evaluated on 3-phase CTA and multiphase CTA, but not on DSA, was associated with clinical outcome. View all a risk of vision loss. We determined efficacy and safety of trans-ophthalmic AND the DAVF with combination (1 patient). DAVF cure was achieved in 11 patients (92%). No experienced vision loss, death, or permanent disability. One patient experienced a to ischemic optic neuropathy.

Primary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale criteria. Their mean was 53 years, and 49 female. (49%) patients presented artery (VA) or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in patients, basilar artery (BA) or vertebrobasilar junction (VBJ) in 22 (26%), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in 12 (14%). Thirty-one (37%) patients were treated with microsurgical and 53 authors found moderate disability or better (mRS score 3) in 85% of the patients at a mean 14-month follow-up. The GOS score was 4 in 82% of the patients. The overall neurological complication rate was 12%. In the regression analysis, patients VA or PICA aneurysms had better functional outcomes than the other groups (p < 0.001). were associated with better outcomes for BA-VBJ aneurysms (p < 0.01), but microsurgery was associated with better outcomes for VA-PICA and PCA aneurysms (p < 0.05). There were no other significant associations between patient, aneurysm characteristics, or (p treated other can result good outcomes. While intracranial aneurysms (IA), and have been previously associated with an overall worse prognosis. Risk factors for IA formation and rupture in with a single IA are well-known. However, risk factors associated with rupture in patients have been less studied.METHODS: We performed a tomography angiography (CTA) within a 10-year period. Patients with > 1 saccular aneurysm with size 2.0 mm were included. The location, size, number, status of demographics and cerebrovascular risk factors were obtained from electronic medical records. The primary endpoint of this study was to determine the association of these factors with aneurysmal rupture. The case-fatality the patients with IA in our CTA database, 425 patients were diagnosed with MIA and were therefore included in our study. A total of 1082 aneurysms were identified. Predictors of increased risk of aneurysmal rupture were age (OR 0.98, 95% CI, 0.96-0.99), size 5 mm (OR 4.4, 95% CI 2.76-7.0); and location in the anterior communicating artery complex (AcomC) 2.62, CI, 1.46-4.72) artery (OR 2.66, 95% Younger 5 mm, and location in AcomC and PCOM were independently associated rupture features patients demonstrated that in the DEFUSE 3 trial, the union of the baseline core and the 24-h robustness measured by the hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) index accounts for the a technique treatment.

Variables such as baseline-core-infarct [mL], arterial collaterals (HIR: TMax s volume/TMax > 6 s), high oxygen extraction (HOE, presence of the brush-sign on T2*) were assessed. A linear-regression was used to test the interaction of HOE and HIR with baseline-core-infarct volume, after including potential confounding variables. Results: We (58-78), and 63% (IQR Seventy six patients (74%) had HOE. In a multivariate analysis both favorable HIR collaterals (p = 0.02) and HOE (p = 0.038) were associated with lower baseline-core-infarct volume. However, HOE significantly interacted with HIR (p = 0.01) to predict baseline-core-infarct volume, favorable collaterals (low HIR) with HOE was associated with small baseline-core-infarct whereas patients with poor collaterals (high HIR) and HOE had large baseline-core-infarct.
