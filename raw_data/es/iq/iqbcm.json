The paucity of in wild natural to act against bacterial resistance mechanisms, and the majority of them have now been focused on the combination of plant extracts and antibiotics to define the availability of resistance modification agents.

INTRODUCTION The discovery of penicillin was the start of antibiotics era which had a big victory to defeat pathogens for over 70 years; however, the emergence and rapid of seriously drug-resistant pathogens have created the greatest danger to public and made the treatment of infectious ineffective.[ [1](#ref1)] antibiotics; the production cell wall permeability due to mutations; (4) the use of to et al.[ [3](#ref3)] In this review, we tried to present the bacterial resistance problem in simple tailoring where the story presenting the resistance problem, mechanisms of resistance, and one of the solutions which is the possibility of using the phytomedicines in treatment protocols, which are distributed in the for the credible information was accomplished using EBSCO as a searching engine to search for the most important in vitro experiments on phenols and phenolic resistant strains to antibacterials to antibiotics.[ using of the antibacterials in a wrong dose and the general abuse of the antibacterials were the contributing factors of vancomycin.[ [3](#ref3)] These kinds of bacteria around dead cases and cost the European economy more billion euros.[ [2](#ref2)] discovery of new effective antibacterials with new mechanisms of action against bacteria remains an urgent task to control the bacterial resistance.[ [7](#ref7)] and duration of treatment, enhancing healthy environment to control transmission of resistant strains, and supporting the research for finding new antibiotics.[ [8](#ref8)] The use of synergism resistance targeting than one site of action various on modern drug discovery and development processes, phytochemicals play a key role at the early stage of \"lead\" discovery, i.e. discovery of the bioactive (determined by various bioassays) natural molecule, which could ideal drug candidate itself or as a analogs.[ [11](#ref11), are utilized by the plants themselves as a cover role to act against bacterial resistance mechanisms, and the majority of them have now been focused on the combination of plant extracts and antibiotics to abundance of [15](#ref15), of money to synthesize chemical compounds without biological activities due to lack of stereochemistry natural products can offer; therefore, an increase in drug discovery from nature in the future will be expected.[ [17](#ref17)] Another important motive to discover natural products alternatives to the limited or failed therapeutic protocols is the unlimited diversity of natural leads which are biologically active or ready for development and structure optimization strategies. In addition to that, the toxicity and low margin of safety of some antibacterials have promoted the interest in search for of natural antibacterials. The plant species are selected randomly and then their phytochemicals are categorized to different chemical groups. The second approach is the random selection of plant species followed by assays; as Ayurveda and Chinese medicine provide information about the medicinal use of plants. Information acquired from books, herbals, review articles, notes The best way to find new antibacterial molecules with new mode of action is the following of an organized-bioguided extraction method. challenges; one of authentication of the plant materials.[ [20](#ref20)] The for inaccurate of false results. Another important challenge is the limited quantities of some active metabolites in the plant species, in addition to limitation of the collected plant quantity to rights of some plants.[ [21](#ref21)] The problem of shortage in medicinal plants is serious and must be put in the circle of care; therefore, the European Medicines Agency launched the controlled agricultural to ensure a few numbers of natural products are successful to reach experiments circle beyond the in vitro assays. Drug discovery of compounds from natural sources is hindered by the complexity of the chemical structures of natural molecules which have stereochemistry and functional sometimes, their by complex stereochemistry of natural compounds could be advantageous from another side of view. Extraction of antibacterial natural products To extract the phytochemicals, researchers can use open extraction system or closed (continuous) system like refluxing with Soxhlet Clevenger apparatus. Extraction of phytochemicals is as hexane, methanol, or ethyl acetate at room temperature. Most of the antibacterials are extracted by an effects. To detect the antibacterial action, the researchers can use the disk diffusion method, in which a paper disk contained the natural extract or pure compound is laid on top of an inoculated agar plate. The volume or quantity of the natural material deposited on the paper disks, the thickness of the agar layer, and whether a is used can affect the results considerably studies. the well test, when many extracts are placed for assay or plenty of bacteria need to be tested, the material assayed for antibacterial activity is introduced left after incubating the inoculum in the existence of the antibacterial materials for a defined period of time. Although this method is accurate, it is a tedious process of blue assay is sensitive be compared with OD measurement and viable colonies counting, and it is more than the agar dilution method.[ [33](#ref33)] The time-kill cells remaining in the broth after addition of the natural extract versus time. The destruction of the bacterial cell by antibacterial agent and proceed through interaction with sulfhydryl groups in microbial enzymes, leading to inhibition those or due and Escherichia coli compared to the ferulic Gallic 500 g/ml against P. aeruginosa, 1500 g/ml against E. coli, 1750 g/ml against S. aureus, and 2000 g/ml against Listeria monocytogenes; MIC of ferulic acid was 100 g/ml against E. coli and P. aeruginosa and 1100 g/ml and 1250 g/ml the bacterial cell wall of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, producing local g/ml, against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative MIC of 30 g/ml.[ [47](#ref47)] Three Potentilla were found to (+)-catechin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, rutin, of isoquercitrin (10 (10 g/ml) was successful in inhibition the growth of S. aureus, while their MIC separately was 10 times 30 to 250 g/ml against Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli, S. flexneri, and S.
