I don't love the price, or the fact that the scent doesn't last long on me. I also bought Alt Crystal NO.23 to give it a try. It smells just like the original, lasts all day on my skin, and I won't even discuss the difference in price. I am a believer. I do recommend Alt Crystal NO.23 (Highly.) I own the real fragrance and let me say that this perfume is exactly the same and stays longer on my skin too. Loved! I will definitely purchase another bottle. This perfume is spot on. I'm always asked if I'm wearing baccarat rouge 540. I even went into their store in Miami and wasn't questioned if what I was wearing was a \"dupe\" VERY pleased. Will purchase again I to my local SAKS fifth to smell MFK Baccarat 540. To my surprise I could not tell a difference between ALT Crystal No 23 and MFK. I will definitely purchase again. Wherever I go, wherever I am - I ALWAYS get complimented on what fragrance I am wearing. I have samples of the actual MFK, and let me tell you the absolute truth.... I get more compliments on \"Crystal\" than I do with the MFK original. \"Crystal\" has the same aroma, depth, and pleasantness as the MFK original. I have been stopped by both men and women alike and asked \"What are you wearing?\" because you smell amazing. I am so happy with \"Crystal\" and OBVIOUSLY so is everyone else. The scent actually itself is definitely WORTH every IT!! My friend has the the authentic Baccarat and this smells identical. It is not quite as long lasting as the original but at 1/10 the price that is not a big issue. It really smells amazing! Beautiful scent This perfume smells amazing, I just wish the scent was stronger Amazing smell but product could last longer. It seems to fade after an hour Crystal smells amazing definetly a dupe for baccarat rouge 540, the only downfall is that it doesn't last :( Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) I have the Baccarat Rouge 540, I love this perfume.
