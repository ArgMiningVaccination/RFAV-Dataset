La evoluci\u00f3n de la cirug\u00eda y su aporte al conocimiento cient\u00edfico When we talk about surgery, what do we talk about? Is a technique? Is an art? What role has played thinking? book Chullmir seeks to demonstrate that in surgery there is a knowledge which integrates not only technical knowledge but also a scientific reasoning and defends it through a critical review of historical facts. Modern surgery based on scientific knowledge began with its aspirations in the field of science in the 1860s and evolved to transcend the romantic speculation paving via controlled experimentation, in its own spaces relying in the experimental work and scientific method. The author makes a fascinating and revealing story about the history of surgery, from its beginnings disassociated from medicine until the early twentieth century. Through epistemological concepts that have to do with the philosophy of science, philosophy of technology and medicine, Chullmir try to elucidate how a technological practice may contribute to scientific knowledge. Directed to readers interested in the history and philosophy of science, the book brings a new and original vision about surgery and its relation to the scientific knowledge.
