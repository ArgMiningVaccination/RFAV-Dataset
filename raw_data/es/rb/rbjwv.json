I: ART\u00cdCULOS INVESTIGACI\u00d3N Y EVIDENCIA CIENT\u00cdFICA (COMPLETOS O ABSTRACTS) 12 Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 2 INTRODUCCI\u00d3N Los datos epidemiol\u00f3gicos existentes indican que el COVID -19 es un brote altamente transmisible de coronavirus. Es probable que la batalla con COVID -19 contin\u00fae durante meses a nivel mundial. Por lo tanto, se necesitan m\u00e1s estrategias adem\u00e1s de la contenci \u00f3n y la mitigaci\u00f3n para su llegada a cualquier zona, especialmente aquellos pa\u00edses con infraestructura de salud poco desarrollada, para acortar la estancia hospitalaria y reducir el consumo de recursos sanitarios (Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud, 2020a). En la actualidad , el COVID -19, al ser un virus recientemente identificado, tiene opciones de tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico limitadas . La Medicina Tradicional China tiene un buen potencial para complementar las necesidades existentes, pudiendo ser una buena op ci\u00f3n adicional considerando las opciones limitadas disponibles para COVID -19 (Chan et al, 2020). En China, la Medicina China se propone como una opci\u00f3n de tratamiento de alto uso seg\u00fan las directrices nacionales y provinciales . Se revisaron las \u00faltimas gu\u00ed as cl\u00ednicas nacionales y provinciales, estudios de cohorte retrospectivos, series de casos sobre el tratamiento de COVID - 19 con la Medicina China como tratamiento complementario, entre otros. L os datos disponibles sugieren que Medicina China podr\u00eda consid erarse como una opci\u00f3n terap\u00e9utica complementaria en el tratamiento de COVID -19. La estrategia debe enfocarse en ir al origen del problema para acortar la duraci\u00f3n de la fiebre, aliviar los s\u00edntomas, prevenir la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad, reducir la mort alidad y ayudar a la recuperaci\u00f3n. La evidencia actual indica que la MTC tiene un beneficio potencial en el alivio sintom\u00e1tico, acortando la duraci\u00f3n de la fiebre, revertiendo los cambios radiol\u00f3gicos y acortando la estancia hospitalaria (Lu et al., 2020a; Xia et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Para el tratamiento del COVID -19 con MTC, la directriz nacional estableci\u00f3 varios periodos; el periodo de observaci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica, el per\u00edodo de tratamiento (leve, intermedio, grave y cr\u00edtico) y el periodo de recuperaci\u00f3n. En cada periodo y fase se recomiendan f\u00f3rmulas fitoterap\u00e9uticas de Medicina china y acupuntura. Las directrices provinciales se optimizaron en funci\u00f3n de las directrices nacionales para la adaptaci\u00f3n local, la mayor\u00eda involucraban medidas preventivas y de tratamiento de Medicina china (Chen et al., 2020b; Pang et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). La utilizaci\u00f3n de la Medicina china en la gesti\u00f3n de l COVID -19 ha sido muy significativa en China (Gao et al., 2020). Los casos confirmados de COVID -19 en Shanghai c omenzaron el tratamiento integral de Medicina China y la Medicina O ccidental (Yuan et Qiu, 2020). En Guangdong, los gr\u00e1nulos de Tou-jie-qu-wen (neumon\u00eda n.\u00b01) se evaluaron con una serie de casos y se recomendaron a 30 hospitales designados como el tratamiento est\u00e1ndar de los pacientes con COVID -19 (Administraci\u00f3n de Produc tos M\u00e9dicos de Guangdong, 2020) . En general, m\u00e1s del 85% de los casos confirmados involucraron el uso de MTC a nivel nacional (Wuhan m\u00e1s del 67%) (Le y Liang, 2020; El Consejo de E stado, la Rep\u00fablica Popular de China, 2020b) y el primer Hospital M\u00f3dulo designado orientado a MTC en Wuhan funcion\u00f3 desde el 14 de febrero de 2020 (Wang y Li, 2020). Son varios los estudios puestos en marcha, a partir del 22 de febrero de 2020, hab\u00eda tres cohortes retrospectivas (Lu et al., 2020a; Xia et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), cinco series de casos (Cheng y Li, 2020; Dai et al., 2020 ; Administraci\u00f3n de Productos M\u00e9dicos de Guangdong, 2020; Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Medicina Tradicional China, 2020 b; Yong et al., 2020), y dos estudios de caso (Hu et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020b) sobre la gesti\u00f3n integrada con Medicina China y Medicina Occidental del COVID -19. A partir del 22 de febrero de 2020, se registraron 24 y 141 estudios de intervenci\u00f3n relac ionados con COVID - 19 en ClinicalTrials.gov y Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, respectivamente, incluyendo la Medicina China. De los 53 ensayos cl\u00ednicos relacionados con Medicina China , 27 ensayos eval\u00faan los programas de Medicina China y tratamiento integr ado. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 3 La acupuntura y moxibusti\u00f3n juega n un papel activo en la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento de enfermedades infecciosas , habiendo participado activamente f rente a l COVID -19, en la prevenci\u00f3n y el control, logra ndo buenos resultados, y estableci\u00e9ndose las Directrices sobre Intervenci\u00f3n de Acupuntura y Moxibusti\u00f3n para el COVID -19 (Guidelines on Acupuncture and Moxibustion Intervention for COVID -19 (second edition) ). En la lucha contra la pandemia de neumon\u00eda causada por la infecci\u00f3n del COVID -19, el Hospital Provincial de Medicina Tradicional China de Hubei utiliz\u00f3 diligentemente las especialidades de la Medicina China, en cooperaci\u00f3n con los departamentos pertinentes para estudiar y formular programas de prevenci\u00f3n y tratamiento de la neumon\u00eda, estableciendo protocolos de acupuntura y moxibusti\u00f3n para la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento del coronavirus. Se puso de manifiesto que la fitoterapia china jug\u00f3 un papel important e en los resultados positivos del tratamiento. Las f\u00f3rmulas herbales chinas albergan el potencial \u00fanico de reducir los s\u00edntomas de la fiebre y la tos, limitar la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad y mejorar la inmunidad general y, por lo tanto, la capacidad de un a persona de generar una respuesta inmune esencial al virus, debi\u00e9ndose integrar en un plan de tratamiento integral que utilice tanto la medicina occidental como la china para garantizar resultados \u00f3ptimos para el paciente. Los resultados de la colaboraci\u00f3 n entre la medicina occidental y la china en Wuhan han sido muy prometedores (Chen et al., 2020). Son varias las Gu\u00edas publicadas en China sobre la MTC y el COVID19 y varias las noticias que resaltan los buenos resultados gracias a la integraci\u00f3n de la Med icina China y la Medicina Occidental para hacer frente al COVID - 19. Una de estas noticias m\u00e1s recientes expone las declaraciones de Yu Yanhong, portavoz del Ministerio de Sanidad Chino y tambi\u00e9n subdirector de la Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Tradicional Med icina china, indicando que el m\u00e9todo puede mejorar r\u00e1pidamente la condici\u00f3n de los pacientes con s\u00edntomas leves, como fiebre, tos, dolor de garganta, debilidad y falta de apetito , tambi\u00e9n puede ayudar a reducir la duraci\u00f3n de la estancia en el hospital. Lo s expertos chinos se\u00f1alan buenos resultados de la combinaci\u00f3n de medicina china y occidental para el coronavirus y encuentran que la com binaci\u00f3n puede ayudar a prevenir el desarrollo de s\u00edntomas leves en condiciones graves y cr\u00edticas, lo que reduce la tasa de mortalidad de la enfermedad . Desde el brote de Covid -19, las autoridades centrales chinas han destacado en muchas ocasiones la aplicaci\u00f3n de la medicina tradicional china combinada con la medicina occidental en el tratamiento de pacientes. Seg\u00fan la Adm inistraci\u00f3n Nacional de T MTC , los equipos de expertos m\u00e9dicos en 31 regiones a nivel provincial incluyen especialistas en MTC, y la mayor\u00eda de las regiones han realizado esquemas de tratamiento de TCM localizados para la enfermedad (https://www.infosalus.com/ ).

From the Western Han Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, at least 321 large -scale plagues occurred in -and-death battles contained the spread of epidemics in a limited area and time. There has never been a similar tragedy in China's history, such as the Spanish flu or the Black Death in Europe. These are examples of global plagues that killed tens of millions of people. In the Chinese history, whenever a plague is rampant, Chinese medicine practitioners are always on the front lines to battle the disease. Many survived with the help of Chinese Medicine; so in this fight with the insidious and novel Coronavirus, Chinese Medi cine once again should take a primary role in effective treatment analysis in 54 NCP patients Lanhuaqingwen granules.

In 30 different countries, there are over seventy thousand patients have been diagnosed in total. Therefore, it is urgent to develop the Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 19 effective program to prevent an d treat for the novel coronavirus pneumonia. In view of Traditional Chinese Medicine has accumulated a solid theoretical in and personal ized treatment via adjusting the specific medicine effect contributing to the Nowadays, TC M has exhibited decent effect in the in the fight against NCP. Therefore, it is convinced that Traditional Chinese Medicine is an effective treatment for 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia. Introduction In December 2019, an unknown Wuhan China. Later the unknown virus was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) and the unknown pneumonia named as thousand have been diagnosed with NCP in 30 different countries all over the world only after 1 month. And 99% of the cases have occurred in China. On account of the NCP reported worldwide for the first time, there is no specific vaccine and drug. Unfortun ately, the development of novel vaccine or specific drug will take a few months, cannot keeping up with the development of NCP. Therefore, urgent to develop the effective treatment for NCP. Though it effective owing to that Traditional Medicine (TCM) is applied in clinic timely as shown in Fig. 1 [2]. After National Health Commission (NHC) of China announcing the emergency situation i n 20 January 2020, the National Admin - istration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) rapidly deployed the work, and the first batch of Chinese medicine experts arrived in Wuhan city on the day. In 29 January, TCM Rescue Team patients were discharged after treat - ment with Chinese medicine, of which six were critically ill. Similarly, the first patient diagnosed with NCP in Beijing was discharged after a combination of Chinese and We stern treat - ment. According playing a one time [4 In these two thousand ye ars, TCM has laid a solid theoretical foundation in the prevention and treatment of infectious dis - eases via the fight against diseases. Furthermore, doctors of - adjust the specific treatment for each patient or integrate with western medicine scheme after diagnosing the syn drome through comprehensive analysis of symptoms and signs. Up to now, TCM has made a big difference in fight against NCP. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 20 The theoretical foundation of TCM for NCP infectious infected by coronavirus are the history of TCM applied for plague has lasted for over two thousand of TCM for to now. Meanwhile, TCM also play a significant role in the treatment of these coronavirus pneumonias broke out in the last two decades, such foundation of p lague and will be an effective treatment for NCP. of TCM for infectious diseases NCP by novel but diseases are not unacquainted for doctors of accumulated a experience nd lot of prescriptions, laying a solid theoretical foundation (Table 1). Two thousand years ago (BC 1046), the concept of \"Yi Bing\" was proposed. It pointed out that \"Yi Bing \" was different from common cold. \"Yi Bing\" was the disease which has in weste rn medicine among of 112 cases, not including 7 deaths from severe heart and brain and other diseases [9]. In 2013, H7N9 avian influenza also broke China. Then NHC of PRC issued the diagnosis and treatment scheme. In Beijing, the first case wa s also cured diagnosis scheme of TCM for MERS in 2015 [11]. Thus it can be seen that TCM have long history of treatments for coronavirus pneumonia. It is believed that effect of TCM on NCP In the early stages of the outbreak, there is neither standard of western medicine treatment nor targeted drugs owing to the unknown of NCP. However, in these TCM hospital or Integrate d Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, TCM has been widely used for the treatment of NCP (Fig. 1). Import - antly, the effect of TCM on NCP is prominent. As in 2, \"Qing Fei Pai Du Tang\" (QFPDT) is screened out by the National Medicine (NATCM) and widely recommended nationwide [3]. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 21 Fig. 2 The composition of the prescription \u2014Qing Fei Pai Du Tang In total, the prescription contains 21 kinds of Chinese medi - cine, which mainly derived from 4 different classica l pre - scriptions originated from Shang Han Lun: Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang, Xiao Chai Hu Tang, She Gan Ma Huang Tang and Wu Ling San. The QFPDT mainly derived from 4 different classical prescrip - tions originated from Shang Han Lun . After treatment of QFPDT, it was reported that the overall response rates were over 90% among of 214 cases in clinic (Fig. 1). In addition, doctors of TCM still will diagnose the syndrome through comprehensive analysis of symptoms and signs, the method to prevent epidemics. Unfortunately, a vaccine will take over half a year from development to approval. Al - though plentiful research institutes have been carrying on the research of vaccine for NCP, there is no approved vaccine for clinic at present. However, TCM has experience in many on as Table. 1. Abundant Chinese medicinal for - medicine effectively was successfully applied to prevent SARS in many areas of China. Th erefore, a lot of hospitals and Chinese medical stage are often with fever, dry cough and fatigue, but part of the patients have suffocating, the existence of lung scattered in and symptoms. there in TCM. the of NCP, not only TCM also those western treatment plan to improve symptoms. As the the quired. On the basis of western medicine, intervention will often in injury organs and limited therapeutic effect of symptomatic and treatment. At that time, some TCM therapy can clear the heart and open the orifices, tonify qi and yin, extinguish wind and fibrosis. In brief, TCM con - the state nucleic acid detection is the key indicator of cure. But fatigue, cough, poor mental state and other symptoms are still present [17]. Especially, the changes of are not symmetrical and synchronized. In fact, the negative pa - tients are not healthy person, since they have no afte r the nucleic acid detection Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 22 turning negative. In the recovery, con - tinued TCM treatments tissues. patients of NCP is increasing from 2% in the earl y days to over 20% in these days. And in partial provinces, the cure rate has exceeded 40% [18]. The application of TCM timely and widely is one of these positive actions in the fight against this outbreak. In view of the excellent performance of TCM treatment. addition, TCM will reduc e ad - verse reactions of western medicine (such as antiviral, anti - bacterial drugs and hormones.) via avoiding or decreasing the use of these drugs in clinic. Therefore, TCM has special ad - vantage in the combat with NCP. However, there are several defici encies in the development of TCM. As shown in Fig. 1, the national medical team of TCM dispatched to Wuhan timely, but they began the inpatient days sufficient Chinese medicin e in infectious western medicine hospital. Obvi - ously, the participation rate of TCM in these hospitals is very low. Secondly, the total number of medical staff of TCM is seriously inadequate in China. Such as this rescue, al staff of TCM accounted for less than 20% in the whole dispatched medical staffs from state and province. More - over, the effect of TCM is not accepted constantly, owing to lack of modern scientific support. Nevertheless, of TCM for a word, the development of TCM still has long way to go. On all accoun ts, TCM has accumulated a solid theoretical foundation of plague. In the fight infectious has been the patient with NCP. - fore, TCM and will be an effective treatment for NCP.

Epidemiology of COVID -19 Zhou et al. found that the genome sequence of a coronavirus isolated from a bat showed 96% similarity with the sequence SARS -CoV-2; these results suggested that bat species might be a host of SARS -CoV-2. In addition, the earliest cases of COVID -19 were all individuals who reported direct contact with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China [ 9]. Many wild animals such as hedgehog, badger, snake and birds are sold for human consumption at this market, although bats are not typically included in this group. Researchers from South China Agricultural University declared the intermediate host of S ARS-CoV-2 pangolin Manis pentadactyla ) although this has not been confirmed at this date. An article published on New England Journal of Medicine on January 29, 2020, reported human -to-human by Guan et al. [ documented that only a few COVID -19 patients (1.18%) were in contact with wildlife, while 31.8% -19 patients traveled to and 71.80% of COVID had recent contact with people from Wuhan. Respiratory and contact transmission are the main transmission routes of SARS -CoV-2. SARS -CoV-2 RNA is also feces -19 patients, suggesting the of fecal -oral transmission as route no substantial research supporting this hypothesis at this time. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 26 Clinical symptoms of COVID -19 The asymptomatic incubation period of SARS -CoV-2 is 0 to 24 days, w ith a median incubation period of 3 days [11]. Once the disease has taken hold, most CoV), East coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and SARS -CoV-2 and clinical features of three different coro navirus syndromes (SARS, MERS and COVID -19) are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively. The statistical characteristics associated with SARS -CoV-2 were derived from the 1099 pat ients (as of January 29, 2020) reported by the team of Zhong Nanshan. The number of confirmed cases and deaths was determined by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (information presented as reported through February 16, 2020). (?) a, presents the result of current hypotheses but without strong -CoV-2 cells During the pandemic phases (ACE2) was identified as the SARS -CoV receptor on target host cells [ 21]. DNA sequencing revea led that SARS -CoV-2 genome shares Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 27 89% similarity with that of SARS -CoV, suggesting that the mechanisms for SARS -CoV-2 infection of target cells may be similar to that already identified for SARS -CoV [ 9, 22, 23]. Zhou et al. [ 9] demonstrated that ACE2 was the cell in Hela cells different was entry receptor for SARS -CoV-2 vitro. ACE2 is I amino acids and is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney and lung. As a negative r egulator of the -angiotensin system, ACE2 plays an regulating absorption of amino invasion of host cells depends on the actions of the spike protein (S protein) on virus surface. The SARS -CoV S protein includes 2 subunits [ 26]. The receptor domain on is transported enters the endosome of target cells. Subsequently, domain repeats (HR)1 and in S proteins another to form a six -helix bundle core. This core promotes fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membrane. The RNAs of virus are then released into of cell via plasma membrane fusion, via a means similar to that used by human immunodeficienc y virus [ 29]. Figure through enters the endosome cells. The structure domain of repeat (HR) 1 and HR2 protein ano ther to form a six -helix bundle core, which promotes fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane. The virus RNAs are then cells, the SARS -CoV RNA genome interacts in a complex with the viral RNA replicase and transcription enzymes . The minus strands of ultimately viruses which are released from infected cells and go on to infect other available target cells in the immediate environment. In vivo studies were also carried out polyamidoamine dendrimer nanoparticles; suppressed the wild -type mice [ 31]. Creation of an in vivo infection model for SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV-2 was not straightforward, as neither interacts with mouse ACE2. Per lman and colleagues Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 28 established a human ACE2 transgenic mice model. With this transgenic mouse model, SARS -CoV could be detected in the pulmonary alveoli. It is conceivable that the human ACE2 transgenic mouse model can be an important tool for conducting SARS -CoV-2 infection experiments and for identifying new drugs that would be effective for the treatment COVID -19 [32, 33]. Role of TCM on denote the The ancient book of TCM Huang Di Nei Jing (Inner Canon of Huangdi ) was written during Western Han a nd recorded that plague, with symptoms familiar to modern times, could be transmitted from human -to-human. Shang Han Za Bing Lun (Treatise on Cold Damage ) written by Lun ( Theory of Plague ) and Wen Re Lu n (Theory of and the use of human variolation to prevent smallpox [ 34, 35]. Dr. Tu Yoyo credited the discovery of artemisinin for the treatment of malaria acc ording to the early records of Zhou Hou Fang (Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies ) for -CoV, influenza Pathogenesis COVID -19 in TCM theory Ancient Chinese people believed that man is an integral part of nature. According to this theory, environmental factors are critical TCM of largely depend on the environment in Wuhan. During the winter of 2019, a large amount of precipitation fell in Wuhan, which resulted in a moist environment increased the risk of virus infection. This observation implies that a Chinese herb that promotes the elimination of dampness (a kind of pathological product of disease in TCM theory) can be used in the treatment of COVID -19. TCM treatments for COVID -19 Classical prescription. The fifth edition of \"Standard Therapy of COVID -19\" (abbreviated Standard Therapy) published on February 9, 2020, recommended that a modification of the integrated Ma Xin Gan Shi decoction with Da Yuan Yin could be to chest distress, Yin had significant impact on SARS in 2003 [ 41, 42]. The use of Da Yuan Yin, Lun (Theory of Plague ) (1642 C.E.); this decoction has been for thousands of years. The effectiveness of this decoction for the treatment of SARS was o [ 43]. A report dated February 6, from the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine recommen ded the use of Qing Fei Pai Du of the integration of Ma Xing Gan Shi, She Gan Ma Huang, Xiao Chai Hu, and Wu Ling San decoctions in Shang Han Za Bing Lun (Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases ) (200 C.E. -210 C.E.); this Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 29 recommendation was based on previous experience with SARS and the cold and wet weather in Wuhan. The Qing Fei Pai Du decoction has been demonstrated to be 90% effective in treating COVID -19 [44]. Chinese patent medicine. According the standard therapy, the patent medicine of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi capsule can be used to treat the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID -19. Huo Xiang Zheng Qi capsule, derived from Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang Peo ple's [ 45]. The usage of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi capsule for COVID -19 was closely related to the cold and wet weather in Wuhan. Likewise, Lian Hua Qin g Wen capsules and Fang Feng Tong Sheng pills can be used to treat fever, fatigue and cough associated with COVID -19 [12]. Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule has broad -spectrum antiviral effects, most notably used for [ 46]. According to a recent retrospective analysis, use of Lian Qing Wen capsule reduce fever, cough, expectoration, and findings, the fraction of severe cases w as decreased after the treatment of Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule [ 47, 48]. Other treatments. Other therapies associated with TCM such as acupuncture, moxibustion, and Tai Chi promote the immune system and improving pulmonary function. Although there is no current evidence relating any of these therapies with COVID -19, they may have crucial roles in disease prevention and likewise in promoting recovery of pulmonary recuperation from COVID -19. Acupuncture has been shown to relieve the side -effects of hormonal therapy and to alleviate pulmonary injury [49]. Cao Gang (Materia Medica ) written by Li tract 50]. Tai Chi is a traditional sport in TCM and can enhance recovery of pulmonary through addition, written C.E.), was made from the fermentation of feces from young men. D uring the Qing dynasty, Jin Zhi was used to reduce fever in patients with plague [ 52]. Summary and future perspectives Since the emergence of COVID -19, clinicians and researchers have made great efforts to understand the develop drugs its treatment. Currently, are antiviral available to treat SARS -CoV-2. On February issues related to both safety and efficacy, it will take some time to develop both antiviral drugs and a vaccine to oxygen and mechanical ventilation have been used as the treatment of COVID -19. Therapies based on principles of TCM have improved symptoms in -19 Positive responses from patients have been noted when efforts are made to combine approaches from TC M and Western medicine on COVID -19. In the future, TCM may also have a role in decreasing the some of the side -effects of Western medicine, notably with respect to recovery of pulmonary function. Finally, we would like to of the virus S protein with ACE2. However, due to the complex targets their on COVID -19 using network pharmacology analysis, experimental validation and multi -omics. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. References Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 30 [1.] Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

Advantages of anti -inflammatory acupuncture in treating sepsis of novel coronavirus. pneumonia. of Medicine (WJTCM). of anti Background: Sepsis is one of the most serious complications and a leading cause of death in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). unregulated which curative effects are not ideal, as they come with significant side effects. It is critical to seek or develop other effective therapeutics in and provide an appropriate acupuncture protocol that can be Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 33 easily integrated into exi sting medical guideline. Materials and Methods: Current evidences from animal experiments and trials about -inflammatory acupuncture is followed , then the rationality on the point selection and stimulation parameters of acupuncture is analyzed to propose an appropriate acupuncture protocol. Results: Current experiments have shown that acupuncture can play a significant role to improve reaction simple and patients in small sample studies by stimulating the nervous system, but has been largely overlooked in the clinic so far. It is advised that acupuncture should be integrated into the existing in Introduction defined as a life -threatening organ dysfunction caused by an unregulated date, it affects more than 30 million people annually worldwide and is one of the major causes of death for terminally ill patients. Any incidence -2% of all hospitalized patients.[1] Sepsis is also one of the main complications and causes of death unregulated inflammatory cascade following a viral infection is the main cause of sepsis. When it occurs, it is of the utmost importance for the NCP patient to control the spread of inflammation and prevent the development of cytokine storm as soon as po ssible. In the treatment of sepsis due conventional On the other hand, the side effects of excessive use of glucocorticoids are significant. Therefore, for other reasonable therapies have been looking for or combining with. In fact, there is also a promising, simple, and no sid e effect treatment method, that is, anti -inflammatory acupuncture central of the system,[4] has the existi medical guidelines so far.[2],[5] Following a review of recent experimental and clinical evidence a nd the mechanisms of -inflammatory acupuncture treating authors delve in treating the of NCP patients. A of that acupuncture be integrated with the existing therapeutics of both conventional medi cine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in order to help reduce the incidence of NCP or sepsis, reduce the mortality rate, and up the healing process. Scientific anti -inflammatory acupuncture for of sepsis, of serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - or interleukin (IL) -6 level is related to the rise of Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 34 mortality in sepsis patients. A decreased 28 found following with decreased concentrations of TNF - and IL -6 in blood after treatment. So far, there are many laboratory and clinical evidences that show acupuncture or electroacupuncture (EA) activation and the produ ction of TNF, IL beta, IL -6, IL-18, and other pro -inflammatory cytokines via the stimulation of the vagus nerve.[4] In 2014, Torres -Rosas et al . reported that when EA was appli to cytokines were stimulated results found that half of those mice survived for at least a week, whereas none of those mice that did not receive acupuncture survived. That discovery presen ted a potential novel approach to use acupuncture for sepsis in humans. They observed that EA at These results indicated that EA had an inhibition effect and not just merely delayed the production of cytokines. It is also found that the surgical removal of sciatic nerve (not the common tibial nerve) can reduce the anti -inflammatory potential of EA. This suggested that both the common peroneal and the tibial nerves contribute to the anti by activating the sciatic nerve and demonstrated for the first time the nerve and Guanyuan (CV4) of mice (5 -8 mm and 3 - 5 mm de pth respectively, then retain the needle for 30 min with continuous wave of 3 Hz, once every 12 h for a total of 3 times) could increase the synthesis and release of vasoactive intestinal peptide and wave, min/time, 2 times/day days).[8] 14+/HLA is the antigen expression on of monocyte/macrophage and its decrease closely related to the degree of immunosuppression in In 2015, there were also small sample clinical trials of acupuncture for sepsis in of ninety patients with sepsis were randomly divided into a control group, thymosin 1 group, and acupuncture treatment group, thirty cases in each group. The control group received routine treatment according guiding principle sepsis. Thymosin 1 group was injected subcutaneously once a day for 6 days. In the needling in the morning, twirling and toning for about 20 - 30 s, keeping the needle for 30 min, during which three times of needling were conducted, each time for about 20 s), once a day for 6 days. T cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+/CD8+) time, readmission rate, and 28 -day three groups were compared. The results showed that after 6 days of treatment, the T cell subsets and Igs were significantly increased in the three groups ( P < 0.01). The levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, IgG, IgA, and IgM in thymosin 1 group and acupuncture group were significantly higher ( P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) of thymosin 1 group and acupuncture treatment group was significantly shorter, and the readmission rate and 28 -day mortality rate were lower ( P < 0.05, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between thymosin 1 group and acupuncture group.[9] is patients, 5-10 mm and 5 -7 mm inserted, respectively, could not reduce of sepsis, but also shorten the length of stay in the ICU when reducing the level of blood lactate.[10] As for the main mechanism of acupuncture or EA in the treatment of sepsis, it has been almost clear that it activated by acupuncture (EA) in Hegu (LI4) or Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 35 Zusanli (ST36) in the treatment of pathway the vagus -spleen to the and from T cells containing functional c holine acetyltransferase cells). -inflammatory effect of at Hegu is vagus -adrenal medulla by sympathetic nerve, now known to also have has anti -inflammatory role. A typical adrenalectomy stimulation can a successful strategy to induce the production and systemic distribution four advantages. First, acupuncture therapy is suitable for all stages of the NCP patients. For mild cases, it can strengthen the immunity of the bod y and reduce the risk of deterioration. For severe cases, it can also alleviate the disease as much as possible through neural and bidirectional regulation of the function. The of is generally thought to be caused by unregulated production of IL -8 are rapidly produced in body fluids after the body is infected. This stage is characterized by a hyperactivity of the immune system. With the progress of the pathological course, im munosuppression is being dominated, which is often the key to determine the prognosis of sepsis patients.[14] Therefore, the production or release of pro -inflammatory cytokines s hould be controlled or limited as soon as possible in the early stage of sepsis, and the Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 36 immunosuppression should be relieved regulati on of immune function. No matter to control the cytokine storm in the early stage of sepsis or to improve the immunosuppression in the acupunct ure depends on the functional state before acupuncture, that is, if the production or release of cytokines is excessive, the acupuncture stimulation may weaken the cytokine storm, and if the immunosuppression has occurred, the acupuncture stimulation may d ecrease the immunosuppression. When applying acupuncture in the treatment of sepsis, those side effects of glucocorticoids would not occur. originally low and decrease when it was originally high. Other studies have observed that ACTH level in the blood of healthy people increased rapidly after acupuncture, reaching 1.5 -2 times of that before t he treatment, and peaking at 2 -5 min. The concentration of cortisol in the blood increased to 1.5 -2 times (15%) of that before the treatment.[15] After 20 min of acupuncture at H egu (LI4) and Zusanli (ST36), the level of corticosteroids in the blood of healthy people increased significantly and a longer receiving acupuncture, 17 24 -h urine, which indicates the increase of ACTH after acupuncture. In animal experiments, after EA, the content of ACTH in the blood was measured directly, and there was also a significant levels of ACTH and corticosteroids had increase d before acupuncture, acupuncture could reduce them. In 2017, when studying the effects of acupoint association hormones in rats, were significantly higher in the insomnia group. After CORT of them decreased some extent, compared with the model group.[16] In several of these animal studies, sepsis was associated with a significant early increase in ACTH l evels, which returned to baseline around 72 h. The clinical studies have found that the ACTH level of critical patients was significantly lower than that of the control group, especially in septic shock.[3] From this, the effect related to the bidirectional or immunity actions of acupuncture are stimulating the nervous syste m. The neural regulation by acupuncture has a rapid and accurate feature, although not lasts long, take the acute stress reaction (e.g., fight or flight) as an timeline: in response and noradrenalin (NE). This results in an increase in heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and breathing rate. After the threat is over, it takes between 20 and 60 min for the body to return to its prearousal levels. If the thr eat is real and the \"fight\" is unavoidable, the HPA axis is activated after the first surge of adrenaline subsides. The release of cortisol by the adrenal cortex starts later takes place within 20 -30 s and thus last longer. Once the danger has passed, the production of cortisol will cease too and consequently the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is attained.[17] The elevated endogenous cortisol s ecretion is generally for the sake of activating body's anti -inflammation action, as it does not effects on the immune syste m through the action of adrenaline and cortisol, researches have shown that the HPA axis can positive on system, effects of cortisol and increasing the killing ability of natural killer cells. ACTH, part of t he HPA axis response, has an opposite effect to that of cortisol. These results may be of great significance in the treatment Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 37 of diseases is t he essence for patients with cytokine storm and rescue some patients from deathbeds. As for the short duration of action from each acupuncture session, it can be improved by shortening the treatment interval by increasing treatment frequency from daily to even several sessions per day. Third, acupuncture therapy not only has the effect of regulating immune has beneficial effect on other system functions of the body.[18] For example, the lung is the first target organ damaged by sepsis, which of 7 mm), followed by a pulse current of (3 V, 2 m, 3 Hz) for 12 min, 8 h for 1 time, for 2 days, reduced the inflammatory reaction and the acute lung injury of rats with sepsis after being scalded.[19] In another acupuncture the acute lung injury of sepsis patients by regulating added with disperse and dense wave, continuously stimulating for 30 min, 1 time a day for 5 days, which improved the oxygenation index of sepsis patients, reduced the score serum and increased the concentration of IL -12.[20] Another example is that the gastrointestinal tract is often the initial organ of sepsis. In first destroy the gastrointestinal function, and then the gastrointestinal mucosa is swollen and eroded, the permeability is increased, of early treatment of sepsis. Reported by Yu day for 5 days) could effectively improve gastrointestinal symptoms, reduce with severe sepsis.[21] Reported et al on the of routine treatment, wave, 4 Hz, 60 min each time, twice a day for 3 days). It improved the intestinal permeability of patients with sepsis, function as as possible, and achieved the target 20 -25 Kcal/kg per day feeding in the early stage of the patients with critical illness.[22] In 2009, Hu et al. observed that EA (a constant voltage, 2 -100 Hz, 2 mA for 0.5 h) at Zusanli (ST36) the elevated small and alleviate were the activation of vagus - cholinergic anti -inflammatory pathways.[23] Acupuncture alleviat some serious life -threatening symptoms, such as for patients in shock, low blood be improved by enhancing microcirculation; for regulatory role. As for the treatment of mild cases o f NCP, it is more acupuncture seemed to have a faster stimulatio n its effects are not the same as that of acupuncture. In a pilot controlled clinical trial,[25] it was observed (ST36) (CV4) had different effects on fatigue by regulating ANS. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 38 Acupuncture was more effective in instantaneous mechanism of the intervention may be through activation of the vagus nerve and the moxibustion the long the view a stronger needle be easily recognized as a kind by the body, stimulating the sympathetic nerve HPA of addition, the needling can also induce the anti -inflammatory effect of the assured that this be resolved as long as the cleaning needling technique is strictly by be a bit inconvenient to the practitioner, especially when begin to manipulate the needles. but it is worth in the long -run when compared with the possible therapeutic as massage, cupping, or scraping) can be alternatives of acupuncture in the treatment of sepsis, more comparative studies are needed. At the moment, the anti -inflammatory role of acupuncture is ac hieved by manual needling or EA at acupoints. Similar effects also by Although the vagus -stimulating action of acupuncture is not as precise and repeatable as implantable electrode stimulation, it is still more simple and feasible, with no need to worry about our own expertise, we propose a of protocols and convenient for clinical application. It is suggested to use them in conjunction with existing integrative therapeutics. Point selection and needling methods Any single one or combinations of the following three groups of main acupoints can be selected and it beneath the needle). to Deqi , simply retain the \"needle -awakening manipulation\" (slightly twist the needle) to enhance the stimulation for up to a 1 min. 3. Bilateral ear reflex points/tender points inside the concha (such as the lung/heart points in the cavum concha and the kidney/small intestine points in the cymba concha). First, detect the tender points either by simple pressure or measurement of low electrical conductance. Use a slightly thick filiform needle (0.25 -0.3 diameter) to penetrate the ear poi nt (such as lung point to heart Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 39 point) to the subcutaneous area of the reflex area. It is optimal to have sharp pain as and pricked again). Retain the for 30 min. After the removal of needle , the needling spot can slightly bleed (about 10 drops is proper) ion parameters For patients without contraindications of electrical stimulation, possible treatment frequency should be ensured, preferably 2-4 times per adjusted to the patie nt's needling sensations are not necessary for acupuncture efficacy, it is more appropriate for critical or acute patients to perceive needling sense as a sign of therapeutic informatio n of acupuncture being inputted into the body. Supporting evidence for the protocol In the treatment of NCP with sepsis, because the local anti -inflammatory effect of acupuncture is required, distal acupoints can be chosen. The above -mentioned three sets of main points in the protocol are located in the upper limbs, lower limbs, and auricle, respectively. When those points are stimulated simultaneously, that is referred as a type of point -association method through different affe rent pathways:[26] The ear reflex by cranial nerves with the limb acupoints innervated by point association of Hegu ( LI4), the vagus area) as the nerve can also be another target of vagus stimulation. It has been confirmed that stimulation of the concha area can activate the vagus nerve. In 2019, Addorisio M et al . observed that the use of vibration to stimulate the external ear could inhibit the production of TNF, IL -1 , and IL -6 in healthy improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis patients.[27] Therefore, acupuncture at the ear reflex points found at the concha area is deemed a simple and easy method to Sousanli The nction in severe cases.[8],[21],[22] As for the relationship between the degree of needling sensations and perceived acupuncture effects, the experience of classical acupuncture for thousands of years is that \"The arrival of Qi (referred as Deqi) equates to be effective.\" It has acupuncture can activating the HPA axis, it should be that the stronger the acupuncture stim ulation is, the better the effects. However, from -inflammatory view of requirements for acupuncture sensations or Deqi not quite that high. In a recent study, et It was observed that in 32 Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 40 healthy men with deep acupuncture, needling on their hands at Sousanli (LI10) (15 -20 mm), could significantly reduce their HR. study further supp the of limb acupoints and stimulation parameters in the above acupuncture protocol that stimulate anti -inflammatory pathways. As for the benefits of combined electrical stimulation in support of anti -inflammation, some stu dies have shown that both manual acupuncture and EA can have a significant impact on leukocytes -6, reason why low -frequency electrical stimulation should be selected is that its anti -inflammatory action is different from that of high -frequency electrical stimulation. It was found that the frequency EA activate the preganglionic sympathetic nerve to induce local release of NE,[31] so it can achieve a better inflammatory inhibition action. As a clinical reference, life selected. For severe patients with sepsis or in shock, acupuncture with an intense stimulation at the extremities or the governor/DU meridian (central reflex area) may be critical to stimulate the sym pathetic -adrenal system and HPA axis to save life. Although the effectiveness of these protocols remains to be verified via large sample and high -quality clinical trials, and moxibustion can bidirectionally regulate the immune system with little or no side effects. This is especially true when applying acupuncture including EA to treat infectious sepsis by an enhanced stimulation to the nervous system. Finally, we would like to emphasize that even though it is common knowledge t hat the body's inflammatory response to the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms is one of the wisdoms of the body, many people are probably not familiar with another related wisdom of the body, that is, neuronal networks to control excessive inflammation and infectious disorders.[6] Both laboratory and clinical evidence have recently shown that there is a negative feedback loop between the ANS and the innate immunity. Electrical the vagus nerve the production of various pro -inflammatory cytokines.[4] Acupuncture, as one of the most convenient and e ffective natural protocols of TCM, is the best choice to stimulate the neural networks, with little or no side effects. As NCP is now running rampant around the globe, why not give anti -inflammatory acupuncture a chance? Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.

Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 43 On the evening of February 21, carrying the mandate of my teachers Lu Chonghan, Yang Haiying and Yang Zhenhai as well as the expectations of the Tongyou Sanhe community of Chinese medicine practitioners, I arrived in H ankou together with Dr. Lei Ming. The 3rd member of our coronavirus treatment team, Dr. Zhao Jiangbin, arrived the next day. During the first three days, we underwent intensive training about hospital rules and protective gear In the afternoon of February 24, we entered into the clinical section of the hospital. The inviting unit, the Hemorrhoid Department No. 3 at Hankou Hospital No. 8, had so far received 20+ patients in all stages of COVID -19 pneumonia. Some of them had been there for almost 2 months, w hile on the shorter end some had been in inpatient care for about 3 weeks. Quite a few of them never tested positive for the virus, but all signs of coronavirus far diagnosed and treated re than 10 patients The others either didn't exhibit any symptoms, or they did not wish to be treated with Chinese medicine modalities. According to our own observations and those of other practitioners reporting from the front lines of the outbreak, it has become clear that the initial stage of all typical pneumonia as fever and coughing. Many coronavirus patients cough only little or not at all, while their X -ray imag es show clear evidence of that dampness is at the core of this disease. All of the cases we have encountered so far display a thick, white, sticky tongue coating. Sinc e our arrival in Wuhan, every one of us has observed an increase in sticky coating on our own exhibits a slippery pulse in the cun position of the right hand. This phenomenon signifies that turbid damp obstructing the Lung or no cough. Because on one hand the normal way of phlegm expulsion by coughing is missing and on the other pathogens are obstructing with proper airway function and has no way out. This is the most important reason for the lingering \"stalemate\" quality of the disease, as well as the a sudden (lianggan): According to own observations, from the very beginning of the epidemic all the way until now at the front line, as well as the opinions shared by my Chines e medicine colleagues working in Wuhan, the etiology of COVID -19 pneumonia is very much a manifestation of Zhang Zhongjing's classical theory of syndrome complexity and dual pathogenesis. In other words, one can confidently say that this particular epidemi c from beginning to end bears the characteristics of what is called Complexity Syndrome and Dual the Shanghan Taiyang Syndrome in the initial stages of the disease, but they all came down right away with Taiyang Yangming Combination Syndrome, or even a situation where systems (taiyang, yangming, shaoyang) were involved. Many patients exhi bit signs of dual pathogenesis right from the get -go, by coming down with a rapidly progressing respiratory infection with signs of (hebing) variant, which specifically refers to a situation where both the surface and the interior and zang and fu organ systems are involved at the same time, an example would be the simultaneous affliction of the Lung and the Large Intestine. An appropriate prescription needs to take all of these aspec ts into consideration. Many of the recently publicized Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 44 anti-COVID -19 formulas display (Guizhi Fa) approach suggested Dr. Lu Tang (Phragmites are all examples conditions, moreover, the Aconite important method to consider. Especially in it possible to liberate by the -like phlegm that is into the alveoli? Th is question is most relevant for the eventual outcome of the disease process! Why is the typical COVID -19 patient hardly coughing or not coughing at all? I believe that this specific characteristic of the disease is mostly due to the presence of sticky phl egm, which occupies the available airway space. normally required for the generation of a productive cough. From the perspective of Chinese medicine, this phenomenon belongs to the category of dry is a representative herb in this category. Many other seeds possess this type of therapeut of the zang -fu relationship of Lung Intestine comes into play, by removing zang disease by way of the associated fu organ; by addressing yin disease via its yang counterpart. has often been used w ithin the versatile arsenal of Chinese medicine modalities. Examples can be found in historical case studies. -phlegm from the Lung via the Large Intestine. In the arena of acupuncture, the corresponding method would be to needle Taiyuan connecting to Yangxi (LI5), or Yangxi all the way to Taiyuan. II. The Importance of Acupuncture Therapy Our team began trea ting every single patient with acupuncture starting on our first day in the coronavirus section. Because of the logistics herbal how I felt s lightly awkward when approaching my first patient with a needle. For one, the protective gear with its plastic eye goggles blurs the vision. Secondly, three layers of gloves greatly dull in the was worried that the patient would trust me, a doctor who had never treated this kind of disease before. I was by stuffy my chest is chest a road during rush hour \u2014now it has become like an open road without a single soul on it.\" This sort of feedback was a pleasant and unexpected surprise for us, providing us with hope and strength at the same time. Most of the accompanying symptoms, such as stuffiness cough, eating, resolve entirely. This experience proved that my earlier suggestion to \"use acupuncture and herbal medicine together\" in the treatment of this epidemic was realistic. Perhaps the greatest benefit of acupuncture is the immediate improvement in the emotional outlook of patients, since they get to experience a noticeable improvement in a short period of time. This aspect cannot be underestimated in the process of curing this disease. Overall, Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 45 however, the term \"cure\" needs to be in the context of this pneumonia epidemic. This is definitely not the kind of situation where one is all better once the fever has broken, or one is OK once the coughing spells come to an end, or when the virus test turns from positive to negative. There are at least 3 additional elements that are prerequisites for a complete cure of COVID -19 related issues: 1) The complete remission of pneumonia signs on CT images; 2) The normalization of all L ung channel abnormalities; 3) The disappearance of sticky tongue coating. Otherwise, the disease may come back for another round! 14. Ling C quan. Traditional Chinese medicine is a resource for drug discovery against 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2).

On January 3 0, 2020, the World Health Orga - nization declared the epidemic to be a public health emergency of international concern in the second meeting of the Emergency Com - mittee [5]. development of these therapeutics will take months, even years. For this specific indica - tion, rapid performance of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can contribute as an revealed that it is related to the SARS coronavirus, further suggesting that TCM have potential use in novel coronavirus help clinical symptoms and signs of the patient, and 2) the type of TCM remedy and indi - cations. TCM been used According to their effectiveness, TCM remedies are divided into var ious types, each corresponding to a group of diseases. On the other hand, research has shown that many TCM remedies have However, still a challenge to experimentally screen many TCM remedies for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in a short time. In this issue of the Journal ofIntegrative Medicine, Zhang et al. in have activity against virus -caused pneumonia. To thi s end, the conducted a of in silico analyses. A number compounds were - mentally validated for their potential activity against SARS or Mid - dle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These chemicals wer e then evaluated for their suitability for oral administration. Most importantly, the molecular structures of these natural compounds were evaluated for their ability to interact, or dock, with the main proteins of the novel coronavirus. Positive docking s uggested their ability to inhibit the novel coronavirus infection. In order to com - Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 46 ply with patient manifestation, the herbs contained at least two of the above natural compounds were se lected the Traditional (TCMSPT) database [9]. These medicinal plants were classified types of diseases they are used to treat. Only those belonging to the types that have been classically used to treat viral pneumonia were was authors cellular ne pharmacological that at least 26 TCM herbs have potential vivo host TCM novel coronavirus These approaches helped to narrow down the large libraries of compounds into a subset in a relatively with limited resou rces; they also TCM formulas. Although the potential is great, at the same time, we need to be fully aware of challenges and limitations faced by these tools. Computational prediction is a bridge between the ory and experiment, and further research is needed. Inhibitory the herbal compounds with viral proteins and structures. It is worth noting that in a recent study to identify pot ent ebola - virus inhibitors, only two of the eight by screening should their effectiveness TCM of these remedies, especially in those countries, territories or areas with reported and confirmed cases of COVID - 19. Although the difficulties and challenges are fully recognized, we are increasing contribution and benefits from TCM treatment to many patients with pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV), a new virus also named as SARS -CoV-2 by the Inter - national Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 48 Background Novel coronavirus pneumonia was renamed by World Health Organization (WHO) to be \"2019 coronavirus disease\" (COVID -19) recently. syndrome coronavirus and it is a kind of atypical pneumonia. On 1 December 2019, the first case of COVID -19 was confirmed in the city of Wuhan, Hebei province, China and the virus that started the pneumonia outbreak spreads in the country. The major source of infecti on is the patients with COVID -19 and asymptomatic -CoV-2 carriers by respiratory droplets, contact, digestive This disease is characterized as highly contagious and is susceptible to humans of all ages. On 8 January, 2020, the first case of COVID -19 was confirmed in Thailand, which is the earliest confirmed case outside China [1]. On 20 January, the first confirmed case was identified in the Republic of K orea [2]. Since then, a number of cases were confirmed in Singapore, Italy, Iran, the United States, Russia, etc.. Thus far, this disease has spreaded globally. On 31 January WHO of -General of WHO, pointed in the opening remarks at the media that outside China, a total of 8739 cases of COVID -19 have been reported to WHO from 61 countries, with 127 death s [4]. The epidemics in the Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan are of greatest concerns. The fight against COVID -19 gets more serious globally. From 16 to 24, February 2020, 25 international and Chinese experts of the WHO -China Joint Mission traveled to Beijing, Hubei, Guangdong and Sichuan, China to investigate the fight against the epidemic. On the second day after the end of investigation, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the head of the international expert panel of the WHO -China Joint Mission, the senior advis er to the WHO's Director -General, stated at the press briefing at WHO Headquarters in Geneva, that faced with the pathogen, taken aggressive efforts responding to the epidemic. In the report, WHO -China Joint Mis sion has confirmed that China has played a crucial role in protecting the international society, buying precious time for countries to adopt active prevention and control measures and providing them with worthwhile experiences. The report also points out s pecifically the high effective role of non -pharmaceutic measures [5]. The report said that China, as the country with the greatest knowledge on COVID -19, should further enhance the results an d experience response. With regard to \"non -pharmaceutic measures\" proposed in the rigorous tracing, mysterious power, that is various kinds of external therapeutic approaches of traditional Chinese medicine By the time for the authors submitting the manuscript, it is known that in the treatment of COVID -19. In the regions TCM COVID -19 in China. Note: Picture from www.chinanews.com In application of TCM techniques, e.g. acupuncture and moxibustion in treatment of COVID -19. Main content of Guidance Three sections are included in Guidance, named the principle of acupuncture -moxibustion interventions, the methods of acupuncture -moxibust ion interventions, and the self -interventions of acupuncture and moxibustion at home under the instruction of physician. Regarding the principle of acupuncture -moxibustion interventions, Guidance emphasizes: The rigorous quarantine and disinfection are Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 49 required. No matter for the confirmed cases or the convalescent cases, they can be treated in the same room respectively and every suspected one should be isolated in a single room for treatment. During the clinical treatment stage, acupuncture can be combine d with western medications and Chinese herbal decoction to achieve the collaborative effect. For the cases at the recovery stage, the core role of acupuncture -moxibustion should be played in the rehabilitation. is recommended to set up acupuncture -moxib ustion based COVID - rehabilitation stage identification of TCM suggested in and treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition) issued by National Health Commission (NHC) of the PRC a nd State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM) of the PRC, three stages are included in the treatment with acupuncture and moxibustion, e.g. medical observation stage, medical treatment Objective: To motivate the antipathogenic qi of human body and the functions of lung and spleen and scatter epidemic pathogens s from each group in one treatment.

Guidance that either acupuncture or moxibustion corresponding to individual conditions at each stage of COVID -19. Additionall y, the combination of these two interventions technique of acupuncture is u sed and the needle is retained for 20 to 30 min at each acupoint. Moxibustion is exerted for 10 to 15 min at each acupoint. The treatment is given once daily. The manipulation is implemented in reference to the national standard, GB/T21709 Standardized man ipulations of acupuncture and moxibustion and clinical The third section of Guidance is the most characteristic: the self -interventions of acupuncture and moxibustion at home the instruction tuina methods are exerted at the acupoints on the lung meridian and the heart meridian, the acupoints located below the knee on the spleen meridian and the acupoints on the 15 20 min till the patient feels soreness and distention in the local The traditional physical exercise daily, to 30 min each bath and music are applicable in combination for physical and mental relaxation, anxiety Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 51 foot tub and an appropriate amount of warm wate r is added. When the water is ready at 38 to 45 , foot bath is exerted for around 30 min. All of the interventions above are the dominant techniques of health care in Their utilization idea and from recurrence after They play the crucial role in reducing the incidence of COVID -19 and preventing from its recurrence. Suggestions It is observed that the regimens in Guidance recommended are on the base of the ancient literature research, modern clinical research and experimental research of acupuncture and moxibustion and in reference to a series of achievements obtained in the effect mechanism research of recent the regimens recommended to the staging of TCM treatment in Diagnosis and treatment plan of corona virus disease 2019 (tentative seventh edition) issu ed by NHC and they focus specially on the therapies to each stage of the diseases, points out the combination of acupuncture with western medication and Chinese herbal decoction, plays the coordination effect of acupuncture and moxibustion and bel ieves the crucial effect of acupuncture and moxiustion at the recovery stage of COVID -19. COVID -19 is the seriously epidemic disease. TCM and acupuncture -moxibustion have not been adopted as the first option in treatment. Besides the limited understanding in the effectiveness of them, the other key reason is for TCM therapy, especially acupunct ure-moxibustion, Therefore, the to medical staffs must be in the top priority when exerting acupuncture, moxibustion, seed -pressure of auricular scraping, etc.. The acupuncture physicians who had participated in the treatment of COVID -19 responded that it is very inconvenient to operate acupuncture with three -layer protective gloves. In the gloves are broken, authors believe -holding moxa not suggested. The moxibustion device with function of smoke such moxibustion with hand moxa stick can be applicable for the home nursing care. Regarding the effectiveness of moxa smoke, the consensus has not been met yet in academic field. But, in reference to the records of ancient medical works and the nowadays popular method of moxibustion in the folk, moxa smoke applicable for the prevention of infectious Keep Up by Hong GE, in the Jin Dynasty(317 420AD) that smoking with moxa around the patient's bed, one moxa cone on each side of the bed is optimal to prevent from epidemic infection. The m edical masters in the generations this of air disinfection in history. The modern research discovers that moxa smoke acts on anti - bacteria, anti -fungus, anti -virus and anti -pathogen [8]. Therefore, on the base of individual tolera nce, the appropriate use of moxa smoke in room brings a moxibustion at each acupoint is 10 to 15 min. But, in clinical practice, the moxibustion is seldom exerted on aucpoints one by one. Instead , the special device, moxa box or moxa holder moxibustion intervention. The duration of treatment is over 30 min generally and it will be even longer if the heat -sensitive moxibustion is exerted. The refore, of intervention should be longer to achieve a effect if the patient is in a comfortable posture and has strong endurance. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 52 Note: Picture from CCTV Compared Compared with Guidance of the firs t edition, the content of Guidance of the second edition is much richer and more practical and instructive. With the development of COVID -19, the people are getting deep understanding of the disease and more and more experiences in treatment will be accumu lated gradually. It also reflects that the nature of medical development is the process of constant understanding, rectification and conquering disease. At present, COVID -19 is spreading in many countries of the world. China's experiences in fight against COVID -19 have been recognized and advocated by WHO. Of them, the application of Chinese herbal medication, acupuncture and moxibustion have their unique characteristics. Undoubtedly, the modern medicine measures give priority to treatment and salvage of CO VID-19. But, no matter which medical theoretic system is adopted, faced with the epidemic, every measure disease and saving lives. More weapons available in the fight against the disease do bring more benefits to patients. References [1] Jiang XM. The first confirmed Japan 3000 infectious cases in South Korea.

A Review of Historical Classics, Research Evidence and Current Prevention Programs LUO Hui, TANG Qiao -ling, SHANG Ya-xi, LIANG Shi -bing, YANG Ming, Nicola Robinson, and LIU Jian -ping Resu lts: The use of CM to use of CM to was to ancient Chinese practice cited in Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive ef (Huang Di Nei Jing) where preventive effects were recorded. There were 3fects were SARS and 4 studies f or H1N1 inion SARS the participants who took CM contracted infection rate of cant cantly lower thanly lower tan contracted studies. The infection rate of H1N1 in uenza in the CM group was sign in the non -CM group (relative risk 0.36, 95% con the non -CM COVID -19, 23 =4). For prevention of COVID -19, 23 provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM use were to tonify qi to protect from external provinces in China issued CM programs. The main principles of CM u se were to tonify qi to protect from external pathogens, disperse of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal Based on historical records and human evidence of SARS and H1N1 influenza prevention, Chinese herbal formula could be an alternative approach for prevention of COVID -19 in high -risk population. Prospective, rigorous formula could be an alternative approach -19 preventive of CM. KEYWORDSKEYWORDS Chinese medicine, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19), prevention program, clinical evidence, Chinese medicine, corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19), prevention program, clinical evidence, review In December 2019, a pneumonia associated with the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei is has quickly spread to many other parts of China and some other countries within 1 month since the fi rst report emerged. As of February 11, 2020, 44,653 cases reported in mainland.(2) Outside of China, there had been 395 confirmed cases and 1 death from 24 countries were reported as of February 11, 2020.(3) The outbreak o f COVID -19 raised intense attention not only within China but internationally.(4) On 20 January 2020, the Chinese government added it to the Notifiable Communicable Disease List the prevention and treatment.(5) On 30 Januar y 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern for China's COVID -19. Although the WHO said: \"To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to or treat the China , historically, when the outbreak started, Chinese formulae, for prevention and treatment.(7,8). For ex ample, in 2003, severe infectious disease outbreak in China prior to the COVID -19. In 2009, during the pandemic of H1N1 infl uenza around the w orld, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China issued a CM Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 54 prevention program, which included 4 Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) formulae for adults of different CM body constitutions and one for children.(11) The current outbreak of COVID -19 resulted in many provinces in China issuing CM prevention This study has reviewed the historical and human research evidence on CM in preventing and control of infections in order to provide guidance for the prevention of COVID -19. METHODS Data Three types of data were searched, including historical classics books were searched, including history, control group. programs for COVID -19 issued by the state or provincial health authorities in China. Considering that some provinces had regularly and practi ce, the most recent versions of the programs were included for analyses in this study. Literature Search Retrieval strategy differed among the above three types of data. The fi rst type of data was based on mainly manual retrieval of ancient books epidemic diseases, supplemented by electronic database retrieval. including Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, China National K nowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and programs on -19. Two authors (Luo H and Tang QL) conducted the literature search independently. The search date was up to February 10, 2020. Data Extraction and Analysis The following data were extracted and analyzed: source of evidence, time of publication or basis possible, quantitative or descriptive theory of from Huangdi's Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing), which was written about 2000 years ago.(12) It suggested two aspects be employed One was to maintain and improve the healthy qi in the medicine [Xiaojin Dan ( ) in Huangdi's Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 55 Internal Classic, the first recommended formula of CM to prevent pestilence], healthy diet care, exercise and so to resist the invasion of external pathogen, and the other was to avoid the source of infection.(13) These two principles of epidemic prevention as, the Handbook (Zhou Hou Bei Ji Fang), Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies (Bei Ji Qian Jin Yao Fang), Medical Secrets of an Official (Wai Tai Mi Yao), Compendium of Materia Medic a (Ben Cao Gang Mu), etc.(15) The famous doctor SUN Si -miao (541 -682 AD) expounded the basis \"pestilence\" in his Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold for Emergencies: \"pestilence comes from nature, so to prevent it, we need to fi nd medicinal herbs that also come from nature. People would not be infected if they know and take preventive medicine.\"(16) A literature study compared the characteristics of for preventing pestilence in different periods of ancient China, found that during the Jin and Tang Dynasties (3rd -10th century AD), formulae were mainly used eliminate pathogenic factors, while Ming and dynasties (14 century focused on fortifying prevention were recorded in CM books, the case description of prevention was relatively rare. Through limited literature searches, we found an interesting case report: SU Shi (1037 -1101 AD), a famous poet in the Northern Song Hubei Province, pestilence had been outbreak for several years. He disclosed the prescription to the local people. After taking this formula, the number of patients with the disease was significantly reduced, and many lives were saved. This story was recorded by SU Shi himself, whe n he wrote a preface to his An on Zong Bing Lun).(18) Evidence Preventing SARS Three studies were identified including (20,21) conducted during the epidemic of SARS. al (19) designed a controlled study to evaluate a herbal formula for prevention of SARS (no herbal intervention in the control group) and conducted it in Hong Kong SAR, China. The sample size was 16,437 (1,063 in the herbal group and 15,374 in the non -herbal group), and all participants were hospital care workers including nurses, and (0.4%) in the non -herbal group were Nineteen China sample sizes of 3,561(21) and 163, respectively. All participants were medical staff from two hospitals, where SARS patients were recruited and treated during the study period. Among them, Xu, et al's study (20) only included fi rst -line medical staff in treating SARS. The courses of taking herbal formulae for prevention were 6 days (20) and 12 -25 days,(21) respectively. The formulae used in these studie s were both classical formula Yupingfeng Powder plus some -clearing and took the preventive herbal medicine had contracted SARS in the two studies. Information on the safety of the herbal medicines was not reported. The details of the preventive herbal formulae of the three studies are presented in Table 1. Evidence of CHM Formula for Preventing H1N1 Influenza Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 56 Four during the prevalence of H1N1 influenza in Chinese mainland and published in Chinese. In these studies, participants were exposed to high -risk environments, such as schools total sample size was in group, 1 study used placebo and 3 used blank control. The course of herbal formulae ranged from 3 to 7 days, while the follow -up ranged from 5 to 30 days. The that no adverse events occurred,(22) while the others did not report. The details of the characteristics of included trials are presented in Table 2. The data on infection rate of influenza formulae group was signifi cantly lower than that in the control group [relative risk (RR) 0.36, 95% confi d ence Interval (CI) -0.52, and the for COVID -19 Up t o February 12, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has issued 5 versions of diagnosis and treatment programs for COVID -19, but none have included any content on CM prevention and control, but on treatment since the 3rd versions.(26) Of the 3 1 provinces (including autonomous regions, and municipalities) in Nort Wuhan, Hubei Province, the original outbreak of COVID -19), South, East, Northwest, and Southwest China. All programs were formulated by clinical experts organized by local health authorities according to local geographic an d climate Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 57 characteristics and COVID -19 prevalent conditions. The earliest recommending for prevention was by Sichuan Province on January 21, 2019. Ten provinces have updated their programs since the fi rst announcement, 7 of them have iss ued the 2nd edition and 3 issued the third edition. The applicable population of preventive programs included general and pregnant women, CM formulae. The the 23 provinces included CM formulae ranging from 1 up to 10, with an average of 3.4 per program. With regard to the course of CM formulae for prevention, 11 provinces recommended fro m 3 to 14 days, while 12 provinces did not mention. In medicine formulae (one of the minority folk medicines). The basic characteristics of 23 provincial p rograms are shown in Appendix 1. We counted the the CM formulae prevention showed that formulae contained 54 different herbs, of which 19 herbs with a frequency of use for 3 or more times in preventive formulae for general population (Figure 2). the historical records for CM well as previous clinical on CM prevention for similar public health emergencies such as SARS and H1N1 influenza. Recorded literature showed that the use of CM to prevent epidemics of infectious diseases can be traced back to ancient CM pract ice over thousands of years, and its effects preliminarily substantiated by modern human and H1N1 influenza historical CM experience is a the analyses of the prevention issued by 23 provinces since the COVID -19 outbreak, we found that the main CM principles in preventing COVID -19 were to tonify and defense from and resolve dampness with aroma. It was also to of CHM formulae for preventing \"pestilence\" in ancient of a classical herbal formula Yupingfeng Powder, for tonifying qi to protect from external pathogens. In Lao, et al's controlled study (19) of CM formula for preventing SARS, Yupingfeng Powder was also the main ingredients. Some have treat respiratory infectious diseases in ancient.(29) Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 58 An experimental study found that the effect of Powder be explained by its a ntibacterial and antiviral properties and Yinqiao Powder plus another heat -clearing formula could reduce time to fever resol ution in patients with the infl uenza virus infection.(29) At present, the National Health Commission of China has not issued a CM prevention program for COVID -19. The reasons may be, first, according to the CM theory of three -factors concerned treatment ( Sanyin Zhiyi, ), individual, regional, and seasonal factors in the occurrence and distribution of should be considered in prevention and treatment,(31,32) and second, lack of solid evidence of CM formul a for COVID -19. By comparing and analyzing the prevention programs issued by provincial also that was slight regional difference the recommended herbal formulae and prescription principles. For example, due to the dry climate in n orthern China, there are additional one or two herbs for nourishing yin in the formula, like Glehniae Radix (Shashen) and Ophiopogonis Radix (Maidong), while to the climate, aromatic herbs with the function some provinces. There two or more formulae recommended in 18 provinces' progr ams, which were different populations, such chronic comorbidity diseases, population in close contact with -19 patients, etc. In addition, 7 provinces or province - level municip ality (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, Yunnan) recommended formulae according to the types of CM body constitutions of the population. This tailored prevention prevent COVID -19, especially when they are used for long period. The public should choose the prescriptions under the guidance of CM doctors according to the program issued by health avoid taking the not reported in the 12 provinces' program. According to the program s of other provinces, it is appropriate to take the decoction for 1 week. Based on the consideration of health economics and balance of risks and benefits, we do not recommend that all people should take CHM to prevent COVID Due to the highly contagion high populations including medical personnel, family members, and other people who are in close contact with COVID -19 patients, as well as residents living in COVID -19 outbreak would and hospitals across the country. As there is no direct clinical evidence for the prevention of the new emerging COVID -19, current ly reported researches were from previous literature on the prevention of SARS and H1N1 influenza by CM which can only be considered as indirect evidence to refer to the current outbreak. Thirdly, the prevention programs for preventing COVID shortly after the outbreak, which were formulated by CM experts based on their previous experience in the prevention and treatment of similar diseases and their initial understanding of the disease; therefore, effect programs needs to ed in clinical application, and updated and improved according to the evidence of new researches on COVID For future studies, we CHM formulae in preventi on of COVID -19. At present, as the COVID -19 has not yet been controlled, we expect that a series of a t imely manner, to produce reliable evidence for CM prevention of COVID -19 or similar emerging respiratory infectious diseases in the future. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 59 In conclusion, based on historical records H1N1 infl uenza prevention, CHM formula could be an alternative approach for the prevention of COVID -19 in high -risk population while waiting for the development of Conflicts of they have no competing interest.

National Health Co mmission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus (trial version 7). National Health Commission, National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 2020. Diag nosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) (Released by National Health Commission & State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine on March 3, 2020) Since December 2019, multiple cases of novel coronavirus pneumon ia (NCP) have been identified in Wuhan, Hubei. With the spread of the epidemic, such cases have also been found in other parts of China and other countries. As an acute respiratory infectious disease, in Class infectious diseases prescribed in the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and managed as an infectious disease of Class A. By taking a series of preventive control and medical treatment measures, the rise of the epidemic sit uation in China has been contained to a certain extent, and the epidemic in and the accum ulation of experience in diagnosis and treatment, in order to further strengthen the early diagnosis and early treatment of the reduce to the spread caused by the imported cases from overseas, we revised the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 6) to Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7). I. Etiological Ch aracteristics The novel coronaviruses belong to the genus. They have and are round or oval, often polymorphic, with diameter being 60 to 140 nm. Their genetic characteristics are significantly different from Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 62 SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV. Current research shows that they share more than 85% homology with bat SARS - like coronaviruses (bat -SL-CoVZC45). When isolated and cultured in vitro, the 2019 -nCoV can be found in human respiratory epithelial cells in about 96 hours, however it takes abo ut 6 days for the virus to be found if isolated and cultured in Vero E6 and Huh -7 cell lines. Most of the know -how about the physical and chemical properties of coronavirus comes from the research on SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV. The virus is sensitive to ultravi olet and heat. Exposure to 56\u00b0C for 30 Chlorhexidine has not been effective in inactivating the vi rus. II. Epidemiological Characteristics 1. Source of infection Now, the patients infected by the novel coronavirus are the main source of infection; asymptomatic infected people can also be an infectious source. 2. Route of transmission Transmission of th e virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. There is the possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long -time exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. As the novel coronavirus can be isolated in feces and that leads to aerosol or contact transmission. 3. Susceptible groups People are generally susceptible. III. Pathological changes Pathological findings plenty of multinucleated cells. Type II alveolar epithelial cells are markedly hyperplastic, some of which are desquamated. Viral inclusions are observed in type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. Alveolar interstitium is marked with vascular congestion and and lymphocytes, and vascular are laden with and necrotic foci, along with evidence of hemorrhagic infarction. Organization of alveolar exudates and interstiti al fibrosis partly present. The epithelium. virus staining, phagocytosis are and occasional and CD8+ T cells blood vessels Degenerated or necrosed myocardial 4. Liver and gall bladder Appearing en larged and dark -red, the liver is with focal necrosis infiltrated with neutrophils. The liver sinusoids are found hyperemic. The areas infiltrated with lymphocytes and monocytes dotted glomeruli, and interstitium. 6. Other organs Cerebral hyperemia and edema are present, with degeneration of some neurons. Necrosis foci are noted epidemiological the incubation period is one to 14 days, mostly three to seven days. Main manifestations include fever, fa tigue Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 63 and dry cases mostly developed dyspnea correct, multiple organ failure and others. It is worth noting that for severe and critically ill patients, their fever could be moderate to low, or even barely noticeable. Some c hildren and neonatal cases may manifested as symptoms such as vomiting only manifested as and shortness of The patients with mild symptoms did pneumonia only fever and mild fatigue. From current situations, most patients have good prognosis and a small number of patients are critically ill. course of pregnant women with NCP is similar to that of patients of the same age. Symptoms in children are relatively mild. 2. Laboratory tests General findings In the early stages of the disease, peripheral WBC count is normal or decreased and the lymphocyte count decreases. Som if specimens lower respiratory tract (sputum are be submitted collection. (2) Serological findings: NCP virus specific IgM becomes detectable around 3 -5 days after onset; IgG reaches a titration shadows and interstitial changes, apparent in the of lungs. As the disease progresses, imaging then shows multiple ground glass opacities and in both lungs. In consolidation occur rare. 1. the following epidemiological history clinical manifestations: 1.1 Epidemiological history 1.1.1 History of travel to or residen ce in Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or in other communities where cases have been reported within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; 1.1.2 In contact with novel coronavirus infected people (with positive results for the nucleic acid test) within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease; 1.1.3 In contact with patients who have fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surrounding area, or from communities where confirmed cases have been reported within 14 days before the onset of the disea se; or 1.1.4 Clustered cases (2 or more cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small area such families, decreased count in the early stage of onset. A suspect case has any of the epidemiological history plus any two clinical manifestations or or all three clinical manifestation s if there is no clear epidemiological history. 2. Confirmed cases Suspect cases with one following new coronavirus Viral sequence i s highly homologous to known new coronaviruses. 2.3 NCP virus specific Ig M and IgG are detectable in serum; NCP virus specific IgG is detectable or cases were there was no sign of pneumonia on imaging.

Moderate cases Showing fever and with radiological pneumonia. 3. 3. -altitude areas (at an altitu de of over 1,000 meters above the sea level), managed as severe cases. Child cases meeting of the for 50 BPM for infants aged 2 -12 months; RR 40 BPM for children aged 1 -5 years, and RR 30 BPM for children above 5 y ears old) independent of fever and crying; (2) Oxygen saturation signs of dehydration. 4. Critical cases Cases meeting any of the following criteria: 4.1 Respiratory failure and requiring mechanical ventilation; 4.2 Shock; 4.3 With other organ failure that r equires ICU care. VII. Clinical early warning indicators of severe and critical cases 1. 1.1 rapidly in a period of time. 2. Children. 2.1 Respiratory rate increased; 2.2 Poor 2.4 lobes, pleural effusion or rapid progress of lesions in a short period of time; 2.5 Infants under the age of 3 1. The mild manifestations of NCP to be distinguished from upper respiratory tract infections caused by other viruses. 2. NCP detection should be adopted as much Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 65 as possible for detection of common respiratory pathogens. 3. It Reporting Health professionals in medical institutions of all types and at all levels, upon discovering suspect cases that meet the definition, should immediately put them in single room for isolation and treatment. If the cases are still considered as suspected after consultation made by hospital experts or attending physicians, it should reported amples should be collected for new coronavirus testing be safely transferred to the designated hospitals immediately. People who have been in close contact with patients who have been confirmed of new coronavirus infec tion are advised to perform coronavirus -hour apart, of a NCP suspect case are negative, and the NCP virus specific IgM and IgG are negative after 7 days from onset, the suspect diagnosis can be ruled out. X. Treatment 1. Treatment venue determined by the severity of the disease be treated in isolation in a single room. Confirmed cases can be treated in the same room. 1.2 Critical cases should be admitted to ICU as soon as possible . 2. General treatment 2.1 Letting 2.4 Antiviral therapy: Hospitals Alpha -interferon (5 million U or dose each to used jointly mg each adults, twice or three times of intravenous injection daily, no longer than 10 days), chloroquine phosphate (500 mg bid for 7 days for adults aged 18 -65 with body weight over 50 kg; 500 mg bid for Days 1&2 and 500 mg qd for Days 3 - 7 for adults with body weight below 50 kg), Arbidol (200 mg tid for adults, no longer than 10 days). Be used. Using three or m ore antiviral drugs at the same time is not recommend; if an intolerable toxic side effect occurs, the respective drug should number of the whether -spectrum antibiotics. 3. Treatment of severe and critical cases 3.1 Treatment principle: On the conditions do not improve or even get worse within a short time (1 -2 hours), tracheal intubation Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 66 and invasive mechanical ventilation should be (6 and low level of airway pressure (<30cmH2O) avoid and wake the patient early for lung rehabilitation. There many should be performed for more than 12 hours per day.

By February 14, 2020, it has led to 66 492 confirmed patien ts in China and high mortality up to ~2.96% (1123/37 914) in Wuhan. Here we report the first family case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) confirmed in Wuhan and treated using the combination of diagnosis, clinical course, and management of family, suggests the expected therapeutic of patients with pneumonia ofunknown cause has been reported in Wuhan, China. This special pneumoni a was associated with a novel coronavirus, 2019 -nCoV, named initially by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020 [1]. An outbreak of 2019 -nCoV pneumonia (officially inter - nationally named as COVID -19 on February 11, 2020 by the WHO) occurr ed and spread to the entire China and multiple countries worldwide [2]. By February 14, the number of 1523 deaths of conf irmed patients and deaths 37 914 1123, and the mortality ofCOVID -19 was 2.96% in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, which is considered as the origin of first cluster of patients [3]. The confusing and difficult thing for physicians is they do not have specific drugs to either treat or prevent the for different clinical trials are in progress. The pres ent report described a family case, including three cases who received western medicine and Chinese medicine Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (SHL) treatments and achieved rapid recovery. Case report Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 71 The family case includes parents and a dau ghter. The family lives in an apartment 3 km from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. These cases are a typical familial cluster where all ofthem had COVID -19 [5]. All the patients were 0029605) 17, ofgeneral malaise and coldness. On January 19, she had fever with body temperature of 37.3 \u00b0C and experienced diarrhea medicine) and oselta - mivir (75 mg, twice a day) for 4 days. She had persistent severe fever with body temp erature from 37.6 \u00b0C to 38.3 \u00b0C for shadow in bilateral lung and subpleural regions (Fig. 1A). She was highly suspected with COV Oral moxifloxacin and take January intravenous injection of immunoglobin (IVIG, 5 g per day) and dexamethasone (5 mg, once to twice a day). However, the patient experienced recurrent fever (body temperature of 39 \u00b0C) and breathlessness, and her blood oxygen saturation fluctuated from 90% to 95% at the night of January 27. On January 28, the second chest CT scan indicated that her pneumonia aggravated 1B). swab specimen the patient's 2019 -nCoV test was negative (Table 1), she was diagnosed of COVID -19 in accordance with her symptoms and chest CT display. On the same day, she was confined into an isolation ward and started to take oral SHL (twice a day, 20 mL once). On the next day, SHL administration increased to three times a day (20 mL once) without using any other drugs. From January 29 to 31, symptoms body temperature decreasing opacity compared with the pre vious ones. The association of her symptoms with treatments is shown in Fig. 2, and the clinical laboratory results are shown in Table 2. Cases 2 and 3 became simultaneously ill 9 days after they had close contacts with case 1 [5] Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 72 Case 2 is a 27 -year -old female nurse at the clinical trial of Cardiology of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, daughter of case 1, who took care of her On January 26, the patient presented mild weakness, diarrhea, and low take oral Jinyebaidu granules, oseltamivir, moxifloxacin, and arbi - dol. On the day, all her symptoms aggravated with body temperature reaching to 38.3 \u00b0C, frequent vomiting, and diarrhea for 5 times a day. At the night of January 27, her body temperature reached chest CT showed consolidation nasopharyngeal swab speci - men. Considering her contact history with her mother, she was also confined into an isolation ward and started to take SHL 20 mL once for three times a day without taking other drugs. H er body temperature ranged from 37.5 \u00b0C to 38.5 \u00b0C during January 29 to 31 and decreased from 37.5 \u00b0C to 36.5 \u00b0C on February 1. All other symptoms resolved on February 2 with recovered appetite and spirit. Two repeated 2019 -nCoV tests were negative (Table 1). On her chest CT scan showed the absorption of the 3). After her disease symptoms disappeared, the oral dose of SHL reduced to 10 mL once for three times a day. The patient's clinical laboratory results are show n in Table 3. Case 3 is a 53 -year -old male, husband of case 1 and father of case 2, who presented mild diarrhea, vomiting, and fever on January 26. On January 28, the patient was diagnosed of opacity in the right lower lung subpleural fields (Fig. 4). He had no fever, cough, and breathlessness. Thus, the home and took SHL (20 mL once, three ti mes a day), moxifloxacin, and arbidol on January 28. Since February 2, all his symptoms resolved with exception of light nausea, and he continued SHL with other On fully recovered , and repeated 2019 -nCoV RNA test was negative (Table 1).Niu, M., R.

TCM has a long history and played an indispensable role in the Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 75 prevention and treatment of several epidemic diseases. treatment period of COVID -19, more than 3100 medical staff of TCM were dispatched to Hubei province, and TCM scheme was included in the guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID -19 [2], and TCM experts fully participa te in the whole rescue process. The decoction, Chinese patent medicine, team clinical symptom dis - appearance time was shortened by 2 days, the recovery time of body temperature was shortened by 1.7 days, the average length of stay in hospital was shortened by 2.2 days, the improvement rate of CT image was increased by 22 %, the clinical cure rate was increased by 33 %, 27.4 % reduction in the rate of common to severe cases and 70 % in - crease in lymphocyte.3 In addition, in the treatment of severe patients with TCM, the average length of stay in hospital and the time of nucleic acid turning negative has been shortened by more than 2 days. From current treatment results, TCM based patients, has suggested to prescribe pre - scription a general prescription in the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID -19 in China [2]. Among the 701 confirmed cases treated cured and discharge clinical of 51 cases disappeared, 268 cases of symptoms improved, and 212 cases of stable symptoms without aggravation [3]. The effective cure rate of QPD against COVID -19 is over 90 %. Ac - cording to the theory of TCM, the target o rgan location of COVID -19 is the lung, and the etiology attribute is \"damp and toxin plague\". The network pharmacology analysis showed that QPD has an overall reg - ulatory effect via multi -component and multi -target. The primary site of pharmacological act ion is the lung, as 16 herbs to lung meridian, which indicated that the decoction is mainly specific for lung diseases. In addition, it can play the role of dehumidification through the rise and fall of the spleen and stomach, and exhibited the protection other organs. Among the potential targets screen, most of them co -expressed with ACE -2, the receptor of COVID -19, indicating the potential improvement of COVID -19. It can inhibit the replication of COVID -19 by acting on multiple prediction was found that patchouli alcohol, ergosterol and shionone in the formula had better antiCOVID -19 effect, which provided new molecule structures for new g development [6]. Here, we take one highly suspected COVID - 19 patient treated with TCM as example to show its effectiveness [7]. The male patient was on a business trip in Wuhan for several days before the onset of the disease. During the period, fever were respiratory rales of both a1b, etc. Although the was negative, the results of chest CT showed that the fusion of two lung ground glass shadows was enlarged and the density was increased, which was more advanced than that of admission (Fig. 1a -1c). As the serious combined with the patient's performance of damp -heat the heat is more serious than damp, QPD was added for treatment. On the night of administration, the body temperature dropped to 36.2 , and then tended to be normal. After 6 days of treatment, chest CT was better than before, tracheobronchial shadow was normal, and in - flammation was obviously absorbed (Fig. 1d). The patient had no fever or asthenia, coughing Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 76 occasionally, and the rales of than be fore. After of the prescription, occasionally cough, no special discomfort was TCM has own characteristics such as holistic concept, balance of Yin and Yang, syndrome differentiation and treatment, strengthening TCM has thousands of years experience the body and enhancing the resistance to epidemic diseases, unique insights and experience. mild and patients, the early intervention of from critical diseas e. In the severe cases, TCM has won time for rescuing them by improving symptoms (http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/ xwbfbh/wqfbh/42311/42560/index.htm). Treatment practice of -19 showed early intervention of TCM is rate. Furthermore, the reason why TCM works is not only to inhibit the virus, but might block the infection, regulate the immune response, cut off the inflammatory storm, promote the repair of the body. Moreover, the prevention and control measures of COVID -19 fully reflect the ideology of \"preventive diet, medication, etc. In the next prevention and control work of COVID -19, it should give full play to the advantages of TCM in syndrome differentiation and the whole therapeutic complica tions as well as Besides, the scientific research the TCM of COVID -19, its mechanism and in Declaration of eting Interest There are no conflicts to declare.

Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at home, and 213 died. And among these cases, a total of 28 children aged from 1 month to 17 years have been reported in China. For standardizing prevention and management of 2019 -nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts' this experts' consens us the Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis and treatment and prevention 2019 - nCoV infection in children. Background In December, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases, who were later proven to be caused by novel coronavirus \"2019 -nCoV\"), emerged in Wuhan 2020, 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 prov - inces and cities in China. Among the confirmed cases, 1527 were severe cases, 171 had recovered and been discharged at home, and 213 died. Twenty -eight confirmed cases aged from 1 month to 17 years had been reported in China [1]. Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Nidovirales order. CoVs are divided into four genera: -, -, and -coronavirus. - mammals, whereas -nCoV belongs -coronavirus - SL-CoVZXC21, SARS -CoV, and 2019 -nCoV. Current studies have revealed that 2019 - Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 79 nCoV may originate from wild animals, but the exact origin remains unclear. -nCoV critical role in the transmission process. Respiratory droplets and contact are the main transmission routes [3]. Close contact with symptomatic cases and asymptomatic cases with silent infection are the main transmission routes of 2019 -nCoV infection in children. People of all ages are susceptible to 2019 -nCoV. The elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases are likely to become severe cases. all pediatric cases with laboratory 2 019-nCoV infection were mild cases, and no been standardizing the prevention and treament of 2019 -nCoV infections in children, we called up an experts' com - mittee to formulate this consensus statement. This t he Novel Coronavirus Infection Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards (the fourth edition) (National Health Committee) and other previous diagnosis on the incubation period of 2019 -nCoV infections ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly ranging from 3 to 7 days. Current reported data of pediatric cases revealed that the age of disease onset ranged from 1.5 months to 17 years, most of whom h ad a close contact with infected cases or were family cluster cases [4]. Infected children might appear asymptomatic [5] or present with fever, dry cough, and fatigue, and few have upper res - piratory symptoms including nasal congestion and running manifestations. They have no fever or symptoms of pneumonia with a good progno sis. Most of them recover within 1 -2 weeks after disease onset. Few may progress to detected positive; and no newborn cases have been reported case data. Furthermore, the number of confirmed infected cases will increase after a wide use of pathogen analysis.

Peilin Sun & Wen Sheng Zhou Abstract The coronavirus COVID -19 has presented a serious new threat to humans since the first case was reported in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. By the end of February 2020 the virus has spread to 57 countries with nearly 86,000 cases, and there is currently no effective vaccination available. Chinese herbal medicine has been used in this epidemic with encouragi ng explore acupuncture in treating COVID -19 by investigating relevant current literature along with classical Chinese medicine texts on epidemi cs. Based on this analysis, acupuncture points and strategies are suggested for practitioners to use as a guide to treatment. Keywords Coronavirus, COVID -19, acupuncture, Chinese medicine, ghost points, infection, epidemic, pandemic. respiratory (MERS -CoV). The first case of a novel zoonotic coronavirus (nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019 and it now present s a serious threat to humans. One month later, nCov became a global emergent health issue and was renamed COVID -19 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By 29 February (the time of writing), 38 days after the lockdown in Wuhan, China has 79,394 reported cases 20 per cent are in intensive care. The WHO has already released 675 million dollars to help combat this global emergency, t o cover the period from February to April, and has also gathered 300 top healthprofessionals internationally to a COVID -19 becomes pandemic. Despite Chinesemedicine experts apparently not being included in these efforts, in reality m any studies from affected hospitals in China have reported that Chinese medicine has been playing an important role in the battle against COVID - 19.5,6 Disappointingly, according to some Chinese medical academics, in some locations acupuncture has not featured as a treatment throughout the course of patients' infection, but only during the recovery period.7 Chinese medicine has a recorded history of over two thousand years of combating epidemics, with acupuncture playing a vital role alongside herbal medici ne. For instance, Wu Youke (1580 -1660) in his text Zhen Jing (Acupuncture Canons) pointed out how infectious qi attacks the human body via the mouth and nose and then penetrates his study provides acupuncture strategies to treat COVID -19 and is based on both classical Chinese medicine theory and current literature. The aim of this article is to shed new light on this urgent health struggle, and to help acupuncture practitioners co ntribute to their local communities. Clinical manifestations of COVID -19 Chen et al.9 and Wang et al.10 each reported a case series based in 10 miles apart in Wuhan during January 2020, which included a total of 237 subjects presenti ng with COVID19. Chen et al.'s study documented infected patients as presenting with signs of fever (83 per cent) and cough (82 per cent), followed by dyspnoea (31 per cent), confusion (11 per cent) and headache (8 per cent), while 1 to 5 per cent per cent of Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 89 patients were male, 51 per cent experienced chronic illness and 75 per cent developed bilateral pneumonia. Wang et al.'s study reported the main symptoms as being fever (98.6 per cent), fatigue (69.6 per cent), dry cough cent), myalgia per cent) and dyspnoea (31.2 per cent), with 54.3 per cent of the patients being male. Most of the patients in the and cardiovascular illness and malignancy are common comorbidities of COVID -19. Wang et al. point out that the best approach to COVID -19 is to avoid becoming infected in the first place, as the med ication currently available is ineffective. A few points are worth drawing out from these two reports: There are big differences in the major clinical manifestations of the illness as outlined in al.). Traditional Chinese medicine texts that describe how epidemics have been fought through Chinese history can be used to address these points. The Chinese medicine understanding of epidemic disease. The original literally 'ferocious epidemic'), has a recorded history of over two thousand yea rs. In 524 BCE, the Zhou dynasty king Jing was admonished for his luxurious lifestyle, which he was advised put at contracting li qi).11 Mozi interpreted ilence epidemics have emerged in China dozens of times since the beginning of the first millennium, often occurring in cold and damp years as defined by five -phase philosophy.13 A large number of Chinese medicine scholars produce d doctrines during or after such disasters that in time became famous. Zhang Zhong jing (150 -129), who suffered the loss of many family members, composed the Shang han lun (Treatise on Cold Damage) in which he expounded that cold, wind or damp can invade t he human body, penetrating from the yang channels of the outer body inwards the yin channels or organs. He stated li symptoms develop much swifter damage), and can easily progress to a criti cal - even fatal - stage. It is important physicians situation. Prior to the Ming dynasty, most Chinese m e d i c i n e s c h o l a r s believed li yi to be caused by cold, b ut this idea was challenged by Ming scholars such as China, such as in 1641. Wu argued that cold only presents in winter, whereas warm epidemics (wen yi ) can present in all seasons, and that li yi represents an extremely merciless exogenous qi that differs from the He condemned some medical professionals for mistaking epidemic yi qi for shang han and their duty to adequately treat patients. dynasty scholars Ye Lin and Li Guanxian thought Wu may have confused his i dea of warm disease with epidemic disease characters ( warm and epidemic that did exist in ancient Chinese).15,16 However, was not only shown Wu in the chapter on Miscellaneous Qi in his text Wen yi lun (Treatise on Warm Epidemics).18 This warm versus not been resolved, including Wu's conclusion tha t herbal medicine is the only cure for epidemic disease. Regardless of whether or not Wu was correct on this point, the influence of the climate in Wuhan on the recent spread of COVID -19 can be understood using his theory. The Chinese medicine academic Ton g19 as well as many other Chinese medicine scholars believe that the climate in Wuhan in December 2019, with its continuous rain and abnormal warmth, led to the epidemic by fostering cold and damp qi that impairs human yang qi, particularly in the Lung and Spleen. The facts on affecting the Spleen Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 90 and Lung. 2. Patients' tongue coatings are very thick and greasy (described as fu tai , a tongue that like rotten bean curd), indicating heavy dampness and turbidity. Tong and his team have drafted a four-stage differentiation and a treatment protocol, Subsequently, Ma et al.21 and Chen et al.22,23 have expanded on this general outline with detailed herbal p rescriptions to be tailored to individual patients' conditions. The primary principles of treatment are to warm disperse cold and eliminate damp. Hubei medical experts characterised the COVID -19 virus as 'loving cold and being afraid of warmth'. The role of acupuncture in treating COVID -19 Somewhat dispiritingly, while scholars have delivered strategies for herbal medicine, acupuncture treatment has received little attention. This article aims to explore the feasibility of acupuncture treatment for CO VID-19-infected patients, and is based on published herbal strategies for this disease as well as Chinese medicine theory. Professor Sun, co -author of this article, has been practising Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture in Europe for over 40 years. Th is analysis is based on his empirical observations of what is more likely to suit European patients. All Chinese medicine academics emphasise that this by damp, which to heat and stasis. Professor Su n underlines that the key to treatment is to identify whether the pattern is one of damp eliminate clearing scenario; even though damp is also the root latter when treating with herbal medicine, then damp toxin could be aggravated further. In general, the principles should be to boost Stomach and Spleen qi while at the sa me time 1) dispersing cold and scattering damp, 2) eliminating inner toxic qi by venting the exterior, and 3) increasing qi to eliminate turbidity. Severe symptoms can and diarrhoea.

Acupuncture point categories The acupuncture prescriptions in this article are based on published papers on the Chinese medicine treatment of COVID -19, Chinese state -broadcast information combined with the classical Chinese medicine theory that has been used to deal with numerous epidemics over thousands of years. However, acupuncture is by its very nature an individualised therapy. must take into accordingly. It is recommended in mind the following point categories during treatment. Ghost points There are many methods of acupunctur e practised globally, each of which has area, as musculoskeletal issues or emotional problems.13 Ghost point needling is one method that is relevant in the treatment of epidemics. Before the Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 92 1st century CE, the term yi ( associate d with ghosts or demons (gui ), as in the term yi which in Lunyu (Analects of Confucius) often Uncontrollable infectious diseases - li yi - were at this time regarded as evil qi and associated with ghosts.26 Shaman doctors commonly used the term and disease. Of course, symptoms Shang (1520 -1030 BCE) and were used for fighting epidemics in the Zhou dynasty (1030 -727 BCE), for example for treating coma during the Warring States Period (475 -221 BCE). These point s were later recommended by Sun Simiao (581 - 682) for treating mental -emotional illness such as madness.27 The concept should be seen within its historical context. Throughout most of the Han -Tang period, frequent wars and epidemics resulted in great social and economic stress.28 Cao Zhi (192 -232 CE), the prince of the state of Wei expressed his grief for friends who died during an epidemic in 217 CE in Epidemic and periods whether they become infected or of the ghost p oints can effectively counter. Unfortunately, since the systematic development of Chinese medicine in the Han dynasty and the cultural revolutions in the 20th century, medical scholars began to avoid use of practices involving order to distant themselves from shamanism.15 Some modern authors believe that ghost points are actually related to the treatment of yin fire.29 Obviously, when yin and yang separate, yang floats are more easily others). However, it is the opinion of the authors of this article that these points can still be valid in the fight against today 's epidemic threat, especially Shaoshang LU -11 and Yinbai SP -1, which can be applied throughout the whole treatment period of COVID19. They are both jing -well points and are located at the end of the Lung and the beginning of the Spleen channels (the major organs primarily attacked by COVID -19). functions are as follows: Shaoshang (Lesser Shang, also known as Gui Xin, Ghost LU -11: and purges dyspnoea (Hidden White, also known as Gui Lei or Ghost Fortress) SP -1: The Zhenjiu Jiayi jing (Systematic Classic of Acupuncture point for treati ng dyspnoea, asthma, confluent points of the Extraordinary Vesse ls are located in the limbs and can be exceptionally effective for the easing a order.30 first targeted obstructed by epidemic qi, followed by the the burner. Therefore for acute infection by COVID opening up the blockage in the upper burner should be the first priority. The actions of these points can be summarised Lieque LU -7 and Zhaohai qi and blood in the chest, thorax and upper abdomen, and balance the Ren Mai (Conception Vessel) and Yin Qiao Mai (Yin Motility Vessel) Neiguan P -6 and Gongsun SP -4: regulate abdominal qi and blood, and balance the Chong Mai (Penetrating Vessel ) and the Yin Wei Mai (Yin Linking Vessel) Waiguan SJ -5 and Zulinqi GB -41: Release exterior tension and clear heat from the Liver and Gall Bladder, harmonise Yang wei mai (Yang Linking Vessel) the Dai Mai (Girdle Vessel) and Shao Yang channel collateral s. Conclusion This is a public domain data -based exploratory study which has limitations in terms of having no empirical evidence. Despite this, it is based on review and analysis of extensive documentation. As currently there is no cure for or vaccinati on to prevent COVID -19, exploring possible therapies to contribute to this recent global Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 93 health crisis could prove vital. While results from Chinese herbal treatment in this area have been encouraging, they have involved could become a crucial weapon in the battle against COVID -19 and other future epid emics. Of course, practitioners should ensure patients, which means wearing a protective suit and administering acupuncture in a hospital environment (which brings its own challenges). Inspiring e vidence of the role of acupuncture has been appearing since the beginning of March 2020. Professor Zou Xu is a critical care medical expert from Guangdong TCM hospital.

SUMMARY Pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) is continuously and rapidly circul ating at present. No effective antiviral treatment has been verified thus far. We report here the clinical characteristics admitted Clinical Chinese medicine) and other necessary support care. After treatment, three patients gained significant imp in were confirmed 2019 -nCoV negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of the cutoff date for data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for treatment of 2019 -nCoV pneumonia. The high infectivity and mortality as well as heavy such as severe respir atory syndrome respiratory syndrome (MERS) (1). A pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 - nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 and has spread rapidly, with 24,324 confirmed cases in mainland China as of February 4, 2020 (2,3). The most common clinical presentation is fever, fatigue, and dry cough and present with nasal runny diarrhea (4). In severe one week the or verified effective drugs specific to the virus (5). We report here t hat four patients with mild or severe 2019 -nCoV pneumonia medicine) on the base of supportive care. 2. Methods 2.1. Patients For this retrospective study, four patients were recruited from January 21 to January 24, 2020 at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Shanghai, China, which is a designated hosp ital 2019 obtained to treatment. 2.2. Data collection Epidemiological, demo graphic, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcome data were collected through a review of medical records. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 4, 2020. Laboratory confirmation of 2019 -CoV was done in Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Throat -swab specimens from the upper tract obtained from all patients at admission were maintained in viral medium. confirmed chest radiography.

Demographics and baseline characteristics Four patients with 2019 -nCoV are included in this study, two of whom are under the age of 35 a nd the other two are over the age of 60 (Table 1). All the patients had epidemiologic linkage to areas with community transmission of 2019 -nCoV. Among them, two patients (Case 1 and 4) had recent travel history to Wuhan, one patient (case 2) is a student w ho was ordinarily a resident in Wuhan and went back to Shanghai for winter holiday, and one patient (Case 3) is the husband of a confirmed 2019 -nCoV case. It took 11 and 6 days from disease onset to confirmed diagnosis for case 1 and case 2, while 1 and 2 days for case 3 and case 4. Fatty liver was reported in the case 1. No underlying medical conditions were reported in the other three cases. 3.2. Clinical characteristics and laboratory assessment On admission, the most common symptoms were fever or history of fever, followed by dizziness, observed in all patients, on the contrary, two of them were reported constipation. revealed there on common findings. On admission, leucocytes were in the normal range in all the patients (Table 3). One patient (case had neutrophils above range, existence Lymphocytes were below the normal range in one patient (case 4) and within the normal range in other three patients. Blood gas analysis revealed that oxygen pre ssure the normal range in two patients (7.60 kPa in case 3 and 5.45 kPa in case 4) (Table 3). On the basis of the above results, two patients (case 1 and 2) were diagnosed with mild pneumonia and the other two patients (case 3 and 4) with severe pneumonia Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 97 Figure 1.

The duration of antiviral treatment was 6 -15 days. In addition, all patients were all given antibiotic hospital 2). Patient 1 was admitted to hospital on January 21, 2020 and thereafter received the above treatment. On 27, 21 was t negative in throat -swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract. The patient was free of fever, productive cough, short pain, January 29, 2020. Patient 2 was admitted to hospital on Ja nuary 24, 2020 and then received the above mentioned treatment. On January 28, count of leucocytes Results of -swab discharged on January 30, 2020. Patient 3 was admitted to hospital on January 24, 2020 and thereafter received the above mentioned treatment. The fever disappeared after On January 29, showed progressed pneumonia continuous and the pneumonia on February by the analysis oxygen had mild cough with white phlegm, and was free of fever, dyspnea, short breath, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 2019 - nCoV test result was negative for the first time on February 4, 2020. The patient remained in hospital for the second virus test. Patient 4 was admitted to hospital on January 22, 2020. In addition February demonstrated and lymphocytes were 94% and respectively, which were comparable with those at admission (Table 3).

The antivirus treatment regimen includes lopinavir/ritonavir arbidol, and SFJDC. By February 4, 2020, were confirmed 2019 -nCoV negative and one patient was virus -negative at the first test. Lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in combination with other medicines to treat adults and children over 14 days of age who are infected with HIV -1 (7). I t was revealed that lopinavir/ritonavir among SARS a recommended antivirus regimen in the latest ve rsion of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by 2019 -nCoV (version 5) issued by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (4). Arbidol is an antiviral treatment for influenza infection used in Russia and China (9). It was claimed that arbidol was effective against 2019 -nCoV at a concentration range of 10 M in (10). multicenter controlled (ChiCTR2000029573) has been initiated in China (11). SFJDC is a tradi tional Chinese medicine for treatment of influenza in China. This drug is also recommended for treating 2019 -nCoV infection Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by 2019 -nCoV (version 5) (4). In conclusion, two mild and two evere 2019 - nCoV pneumonia patients were given combined whom improvement improve ment by the cutoff date for data collection. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants The study supported by Shanghai Municipal Key Clinical Sp ecialty (shslczdzk05101) and Shanghai Key Clinical Laboratory of Medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (14DZ2273200).

Enviado: 23 de febrero de 2020, Aceptado: 23 de febrero de 2020, En l\u00ednea: 23 de febrero de 2020 Introducci\u00f3n Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 100 W\u00e9n Bing ( ) es la Enfermedad Febril por Ca lor. Tiene como eje la respuesta inflamatoria que es causada en la mayor\u00eda de las veces por enfer - medades infecto -contagiosas de la Medicina Moderna. Wen Bing ( ) es un subtipo de la enfermedad anteriormente mencionada. Posee capacidad infecto -contagiosa , y puede dar muerte a grupos de personas con disminuci\u00f3n de la inmunidad tales como ancianos, lactantes e infantes. Yi Bing ( ) se refiere a Wen Bing pero con marcada letalidad y puede provocar la muerte incluso adultos j\u00f3venes sanos. Li Bing ( ) se ref iere a Yi Bing con mayor infectividad y letalidad a\u00fan. Sin importar si el estado inmune de los contactos cercanos sea alto o bajo, son propensos de contraer la enfermedad. Los que debutan en la fase cr\u00edtica, tiene alta mortalidad a corto plazo, en cuesti\u00f3n de minutos, horas o d\u00edas. Por estas razones, esto ha causado la extinci\u00f3n de familias completas y hasta pueblos enteros en la antig\u00fcedad. El Wen Bing que trata esta gu\u00eda engloba al Wen Bing, Yi Bing y Li Bing. Sugiero al Estado que publique documentos rel acionados al mismo, as\u00ed como elaborar un nomenclador de gu\u00eda de conceptos de Wen Bing, Yi Bing y Li Bing desde MTC. (Consultar el nomenclador de las de enfermedades infecto -con- tagiosas, categor\u00eda A, B y C de la medicina moderna). W\u00e9n Bing se divide en do s categor\u00edas: Enfermedad por Calor intenso y Enfermedad por Humedad -Calor. La Enfermedad por Calor intenso se carac - teriza anatomo -patol\u00f3gicamente por una inflamaci\u00f3n de tipo alterativa, donde predomina el da\u00f1o tisular y la necrosis celular. En cambio, la inflama - ci\u00f3n en la Enfermedad por Humedad -Calor es de \u00edndole exudativa donde pre - valece el edema y la exudaci\u00f3n tisular que evoluciona en la mayor\u00eda de los casos hacia la fibrosis. La Enfermedad Taiyin incluye a las enfermedades del Taiyin Bazo (tracto digestivo) y del Taiyin Pulm\u00f3n (v\u00edas respiratorias). El Wen Bing del S\u00edndrome de Humedad -Calor de Taiyin Pulmonar (incluye los Yi Bing y Li Bing) abarca m\u00faltiples tipos de enfermedades infecciosas pulmonares, tales como: Leptos - pirosis Hemorr\u00e1gica Pulmona r, Peste Neum\u00f3nica y Neumon\u00eda por Coronavirus, etc. Esta gu\u00eda trata principalmente la Neumon\u00eda por Coronavirus, explicando y debatiendo detalladamente a cerca de la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento del Wen Bing del S\u00edndrome de Humedad -Calor de Taiyin Pulmonar. En esta enfermedad es necesario tomar en cuenta las caracter\u00edsticas de la localizaci\u00f3n de la afecci\u00f3n por la Humedad pat\u00f3gena: Si la Humedad -Calor no reside en el Bazo -Est\u00f3mago, reside en H\u00edgado -Ves\u00edcula Biliar. Esto se debe a que el Bazo es el origen de la Humedad. Los que sufren de Insuficiencia de Bazo, les es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil sufrir la Humedad por afecci\u00f3n interna y externa. Shaoyang -Sanjiao es la ruta de humores que par - ticipa en el metabolismo del agua y de los humores, a su vez, \"El Qi del Fuego trata la s enfermedades en Shaoyang\", esto facilita la g\u00e9nesis de Calor por Represi\u00f3n de Humedad o la afecci\u00f3n directa del Calor Pat\u00f3geno. Por estas razones, en el tratamiento de dicha enfermedad hace hincapi\u00e9 en el Taiyin y Shaoyang. Cl\u00ednicamente, es frecuente la lesi\u00f3n hep\u00e1tica; la fiebre se acom - pa\u00f1a de astenia (el H\u00edgado es la base de la resistencia a la fatiga) y, el rechazo a las grasas, s\u00edntomas caracter\u00edsticos de la lesi\u00f3n en Shaoyang. Otros s\u00edntomas a tomar en cuenta son: sensaci\u00f3n de gusto amargo en la bo ca, molestias en la garganta, ojo rojo, pulso de cuerda e hinchaz\u00f3n de los bordes de la lengua. La Humedad Pat\u00f3gena impregna Sanjiao, difundi\u00e9ndose hacia arriba y hacia abajo; hacia arriba se presenta con tos; hacia el medio con diarrea, n\u00e1useas, v\u00f3mitos y distensi\u00f3n abdominal; hacia abajo, dificultad para orinar e injuria renal. La Humedad -Calor puede presentar tanto manifestaciones externas como internas. Por afuera, es frecuente el rush cut\u00e1neo y por adentro, da\u00f1o mioc\u00e1rdico que en casos severos llev a al shock y al coma. Si hay Exceso, es Yangming; si hay Insuficiencia, es Taiyin. Por ende, Yangming predomina Calor sobre Humedad, y Taiyin viceversa. Claves en las indicaciones m\u00e9dicas: El calor no se libera mediante diaforesis. Luego de que el paci ente transpira, baja la fiebre y sienta mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica, con o sin tratamiento, no significa que la enfermedad se haya aliviado. Sin embargo, muchos pacientes presentan fiebre alternante con intervalos de mejor\u00eda que se caracterizan por la incapacidad de r ecuperar la normalidad del pulso (pulso tranquilo), de la temperatura corporal (frialdad) y de la saburra lingual. Los que sufren Calor Ondulante en horario fijo (Ej: muchos lo hacen por la tarde), pueden recibir una dosis de medicaci\u00f3n treinta minutos a una hora previo al pr\u00f3ximo evento (Ej: Los que sufren de Calor intenso luego de las 13:00 horas, adicionar una dosis extra de Yin Chai Xiao Du Dan, ya que el Calor se encuentra en Yangming; por otro lado, los que lo hacen antes de las 13:00 horas o Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 101 inclus ive antes de las 11:00 horas, hay m\u00e1s posibilidad de rece - tar Chai Ling Tang, puesto que el Calor se encuentra casi siempre en Taiyang. A los m\u00e1s graves se les puede indicar una dosis cada 4 horas, mientras que a los cr\u00edticos, cada 3 horas. Tener especi al cuidado con el Bazo y el Est\u00f3 - mago. El curso de la enfermedad en los pacientes leves es aproximadamente de 14 d\u00edas. No obstante, pese a la mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica \u00edntegra luego de unos d\u00edas de tratamiento, se recomienda completar los 14 d\u00edas de tratamiento. 1. Fase temprana 1.1Clasificaci\u00f3n de fases y tipos Esta fase se encuentra m\u00e1s frecuente en: Fase temprana de la enfermedad: Tener en cuenta que la fase temprana y la fase intermedia no dependen de manera determinante al tiempo de evoluci\u00f3n de la enferm edad. Muchos pacientes permanecen en esta fase (los leves), otros debutan en fase intermedia (los moderados), y algunos fa - llecen de manera r\u00e1pida (los cr\u00edticos). Paciente con marcada Insuficiencia del Bazo, que presenta mayor Humedad que Calor: Al momento de la examinaci\u00f3n, se debe prestar mucha atenci\u00f3n en la parte media y basal de la lengua ya que si se encuentra p\u00e1lida, indica Insuficiencia del Bazo o del Yang. Cuando la fiebre no es muy alta o despu\u00e9s del descenso de la temperatura con medicaci\u00f3n, se puede explorar los dedos de los pies para valorar si hay Insuficiencia del Yang, debido a que los que sufren Insuficiencia del Yang severo, los dedos de sus pies p ermanecen fr\u00edos aun cuando est\u00e9n cursando una fiebre. Las improntas dentales en losbordes de la lengua indican tambi\u00e9n Insuficiencia del Bazo, y hay que dife - renciarlo de la hinchaz\u00f3n lingual lateral (fen\u00f3meno de represi\u00f3n de Qi del h\u00edgado). Cuando \u00e9sta \u00fa ltima es dif\u00edcil de apreciar, inspeccionar las improntas dentales en la cara interna de las mejillas. Pacientes leves: Hay que prestar especial atenci\u00f3n porque a veces existe una disociaci\u00f3n de la cl\u00ednica con el curso de la enfermedad. Es decir, que sea leve o no, no depende meramente de la presentaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica, sino que es necesario una evaluaci\u00f3n completa semiol\u00f3gica de lengua y pulso, con o sin m\u00e9todos diagn\u00f3sticos complementarios contempor\u00e1neos como radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax o tomograf\u00eda computada. La fas e temprana muchas veces es diagnosticada de manera err\u00f3nea como S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -Humedad debido a las siguientes causas: La Insuficiencia del Bazo produce Humedad interna, y por afecci\u00f3n interna externa, se torna m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil contraer Pat\u00f3geno Externo. Estos pacientes presentan a menudo lengua p\u00e1lida con improntas dentales. Mientras m\u00e1s Humedad haya, m\u00e1s saburra blanca se produce, y a veces oculta toda la lengua roja; otras veces se ignora el enrojecimiento del dorso lingual generado por represi\u00f3n del Calor . En el comienzo de la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor, se puede observar una capa fina de saburra amarilla por encima de la blanca muchas veces desaper - cibida. Es imprescindible interrogar sobre la materia fecal. La saburra ama - rrilla de los estre\u00f1idos desapa recer\u00e1 una vez que se evacu\u00e9; por otro lado, la saburra amarilla es producida por la respuesta inflamatoria y confirma la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor. La saburra de los inmunosuprimidos no se convertir\u00e1 en amarilla a pesar de la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor. La respuesta inflamatoria necesita entre horas a uno o dos d\u00edas para que los leucocitos se conviertan en piocitos. Por eso, los pacientes con Enfer - medad Calor intenso muestran saburr a blanca y seca en la fase temprana. Se puede precisar la saburra granulada en la inspecci\u00f3n detallada pese a que la Humedad pueda encubrir la Sequedad. Otro punto para recalcar del S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -H\u00famedad es la presenciadel pulso moderado en ausencia de fiebre, a diferencia de un pulso basal le - vemente m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido en el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor. Por estas razones, no se debe diagnosticar como Fr\u00edo -H\u00famedad. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 102 Algunos pacientes aparentan lengua p\u00e1lida con saburra blanca y grasienta. Empero, una vez que recib en medicaci\u00f3n del Calor, se vuelven con el pulso taquisf\u00edgmico y saburra amarillenta, coincidente con el mecanismo de expansi\u00f3n de Humedad -Calor del Wen Bing de Humedad -Calor. En cambio, esta transformaci\u00f3n no ocurre en el S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo -Humedad, un ejemplo de lo \u00faltimo es Li Zhong Tang para el S\u00edndrome Fr\u00edo - Humedad por C\u00f3lera Debido a la presencia de una noxa clara y determinada en Wen Bing, no se sostiene la hip\u00f3tesis de que una parte de esta enfermedad sea producida por Humedad -Calor y otra por Fr\u00edo -Hum edad. La Humedad es un pat\u00f3geno Yin y el Calor, un pat\u00f3geno Yang. Contemplando la variabilidad de la consti - tuci\u00f3n f\u00edsica, sea m\u00e1s fr\u00edo o m\u00e1s calor, se produce diferentes tipos de mani - festaciones cl\u00ednicas. Sin embargo, esto no influye en el diagn\u00f3stico del S\u00edn - drome Humedad -Calor de esta enfermedad. Por lo tanto, solo hay que ajustar las f\u00f3rmulas seg\u00fan la variabilidad de la constituci\u00f3n f\u00edsica y el nivel de Hume - dad o Calor. Otros tantos presentan tos seca o con escasa flema, que pueden llevar a un err or diagn\u00f3stico de Insuficiencia del Yin. La escasa flema se debe a dif\u00edcil expectoraci\u00f3n por su localizaci\u00f3n en el intersticio alv\u00e9olo pulmonar, diferente de la bronquitis y de la bronquiolitis. Por este motivo, no se puede diagnosti - car como Insuficienci a del Yin o ausencia de la Humedad por la escasa flema. 1.2 Tratamiento 1.2.1 Elaboraci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula F\u00f3rmula de Wu Men, Chai Ling Tang modificada. Ingredientes: Chai Hu 24g, 30g. 1.2.2 Explicaci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula En el \u00a8Shang Han Lun\u00a8 est\u00e1 documentado el uso de la f\u00f3rmula Wu Ling San para el tratamiento de v\u00f3mito, diarrea, tos y fiebre por afecci\u00f3n externa; y Xiao Chai Hu Tang para el Calor por afecci\u00f3n externa. Sanjiao es la ruta de los humores, Xiao Chai Hu Tang tambi\u00e9n se indica para la tonificaci\u00f3n de los movimientos de los l\u00edquidos corporales, as\u00ed como se dice: \u00a8Si el Jiao superior (Shangjiao) se desbloquea, los l\u00edquidos y los humores bajan, entonces, el Qi del est\u00f3mago se armoniza y el Calor se libera por sudoraci\u00f3n lluviosa.\u00a8 [3] Shi Shang Bo se usa para la infecci\u00f3n pulmonar y Sheng Gan Cao para la desinto - xicaci\u00f3n ya que el \u00e1cido glicirret\u00ednico (\u00e1cido de Gan Cao) tiene prop iedades los glucocorticoides. Shu\u00a8 (Obras completas de Jing Yue) est\u00e1 registrado que al Wu Ling San hay que agregarle Qiang Huo para la afecci\u00f3n externa por Fr\u00edo -Humedad; mientras que en mi experiencia es adi cionar Lian Qiao cuando la afecci\u00f3n externa fuera por Humedad -Calor. Lian Qiao tiene funciones antiem\u00e9ticas (como Gan Lu Xiao Du Dan), refresca la sangre (como Qing Ying Tang), depura el coraz\u00f3n (como Qing Gong Tang), depura el h\u00edgado (como Ma Huang Lian Q iao Chi Xiao Dou Tang) adem\u00e1s de liberar la superficie. Puesto que la fisiopatolog\u00eda de Shaoyang es lucha entre lo recto y lo perverso, los que sufren de modo cr\u00edtico el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor evoluciona casi siempre con falla hep\u00e1tica fulmi - nante. Asimis mo, es frecuente que Wen Bing afecta directamente a la capa nutricia ( ) y a la capa sangu\u00ednea ( ) por lo que se ve en la fase temprana una lengua espiculada. Contemplando todos los factores mencionados ante - riormente, hay que dar m\u00e1s dosis de Lian Qiao. Hay que tener mucho cuidado con el uso de medicamentos que refuerzan la Energ\u00eda Recta, como Huan Qi o Ren Shen, ya que \u00e9stos pueden exacerbar la respuesta inflamatoria. Por esta raz\u00f3n, se quita Ren Shen del Xiao Chai Hu Tang. Para los individuos con comple xi\u00f3n d\u00e9bil, se puede aumentar la dosis de Sheng Gan Cao hasta 9 -15g e incluso a\u00f1adir Tai Zhi Shen 15 -50g. Cabe destacar, hay que controlar la tensi\u00f3n de lucha entre el Qi recto y el Qi per - verso. Se necesita Ren Shen y Huan Qi para eliminar definitivament e la causa patog\u00e9nica de la infecci\u00f3n citol\u00edtica en individuos con Insuficiencia del Bazo. Sin embargo, no es \u00e9sta la fisiopatolog\u00eda de esta enfermedad. Cuando existe una alteraci\u00f3n inmunol\u00f3gica, el tratamiento alop\u00e1tico son los antiinflamato - rios anticit oquinas. Empero, el uso de Ren Shen y Huan Qi en MTC refuerza la respuesta inmune, por lo cual se debe indicar con mucha precauci\u00f3n. No se recomienda su uso si no fueran expertos tanto en W\u00e9n Bing Xue de MTC como en Infectolog\u00eda de medicina alop\u00e1tica. Se r ecomienda sumar Zhi Ban Xia 9g y una cucharada de jugo de Jengibre Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 103 para enfermos con marcada hiperemesis y diarrea. El jugo de Jengibre facilita la transformaci\u00f3n de la Humedad y no genera Calor, por lo que su uso es relativamente mayor que Sheng Jiang en W\u00e9n Bing. Por este motivo, el Jugo de Jengibre sustituye a Sheng Jiang en Xiao Chai Hu Tang. Se recomienda incorporar Dang Gui 9g en pacientes con evidente Insuficiencia de sangre o en las mujeres durante el per\u00edodo menstrual. En los pacientes con Humedad intensa, se descarta Da Zhao de Xiao Chai Hu Tang por su nutrici\u00f3n grasienta, y se prefiere al Dang Gui que tiene acci\u00f3n antiinflama - toria espec\u00edfica en capa sangu\u00ednea ( ) adem\u00e1s de vigorizar y nutrir la sangre. Se recomienda asociar Ge Gen 30g (m\u00e9todo G e Gen Qin Lian Tang) a los pacientes con diarrea abundante o presentan tez colorada destacable. Se recomienda agregar Cao Guo 3 -6g (m\u00e9todo Da Yuan Yin) si presenta saburra blanca, gruesa y s\u00edmil polvo. Cao Guo es medicamento especial para saburra blanca y gruesa (engrosamiento de papilas filiformes). Agregar Hou Pu en caso de distensi\u00f3n abdominal o Bing Lang (debe tener materia fecal s\u00f3lida) para los m\u00e1s severos. 1.3 Evoluci\u00f3n La evoluci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica habitual es la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor por Represi\u00f3n de la H umedad, que se asemeja al concepto del s\u00edndrome de respuesta infla - matoria sist\u00e9mica (SIRS) o de sobreinfecci\u00f3n bacteriana en la medicina occi - dental moderna. A continuaci\u00f3n se detallan algunos m\u00e9todos para determinar si la Humedad Pat\u00f3gena se ha transfo rmado en Calor: El primero es ver si sobre la saburra blanca existe otra capa amarilla. El segundo es examinar la presencia o no de enrojecimiento lingual o gloquidios en el dorso de la lengua. El tercero es palpar el pulso. El pulso impetuoso ( Zao Mai) indica transformaci\u00f3n en Calor, pero \u00e9ste no solo se limita a la frecuencia de pulsos por minuto. Los principiantes pueden contar la frecuencia teniendo en cuenta lo siguiente: la frecuencia basal del pulso moderado de Insuficiencia del Bazo es de 70 por minuto, mientras que la basal de pulso lento de Insuficiencia del Yang es de 60 por minuto. Entonces, palpar el pulso es una manera de evaluar la temperatura corporal ya que por cada aumento de 1 , la frecuencia de pulso aumenta 10 por minuto. De esta mane ra, se puede estimar el nivel de transformaci \u00f3n en Calor o si existe Calor interno seg \u00fan la relaci \u00f3n entre la temperatura corporal y la frecuencia de pulso. El cuarto es verificar si hay sobreinfecci\u00f3n bacteriana. Cl\u00ednicamente es com\u00fan encontrar dolor de g arganta, inflamaci\u00f3n o supuraci\u00f3n amigdalina o aumento de leucocitos a predominio de neutr\u00f3filos absolutos en el an\u00e1lisis de sangre. Como esta enfermedad genera linfopenia, el aumento porcentual re - lativo de neutr\u00f3filos no implica infecci\u00f3n bacteriana. Se recomienda quitar Gui Zhi o bajar su dosis a 3 -6g o reemplazarla por Rou Gui cuando es dif\u00edcil determinar si hay transformaci\u00f3n en Calor o no. La f\u00f3rmula de la fase intermedia es m\u00e1s segura mientras que la de fase temprana libera m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido el Calor. Es d ecir, al no poder discernir clara - mente la presencia de transformaci\u00f3n en Calor, indicar directamente la f\u00f3r - mula de fase intermedia, especialmente para los principiantes de la MTC. Al indicar f\u00f3rmula de fase intermedia en pacientes de fase temprana, que mu- chas veces sufren de Insuficiencia del Bazo constitucional, es importante adi - cionar Chen Pi y/o Cang Zhu para cuidado del Bazo y Est\u00f3mago. Hay dos formas de manejo en los pacientes que predomina el Calor: el primero es indicar directamente la f\u00f3rmul a de la fase intermedia y; el se - gundo es incorporar Shi Gao, Hua Shi y Han Shui Shi (M\u00e9todo Gan Lu Yin) sobre la f\u00f3rmula de la fase temprana as\u00ed como sustituir Rou Gui 3g por Gui Zhi en la decocci\u00f3n o Rou Gui 1g v\u00eda oral. 2. Fase intermedia 2.1 Clasific aci\u00f3n de fases y tipos Existen tres tipos: Los individuos con Calor Interno constitucional, debutan directamente en fase intermedia cuando contraen esta enfermedad. Los pacientes con predominio de Humedad en s\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor son m\u00e1s propensos a desarrollar la Transformaci\u00f3n en Calor por Represi\u00f3n de Humedad. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 104 Pacientes tipo moderado. Hay que prestar especial atenci\u00f3n porque amenudo existe una disociaci\u00f3n de la mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica con la progresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad. Es decir, que sea moderado o no, no depende meramente de la presentaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica, sino que es necesario una evaluaci\u00f3n semiol\u00f3gica com - pleta de lengua y pulso, con o sin m\u00e9todos diagn\u00f3sticos complementarios con - tempor\u00e1neos como radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax o tomograf\u00eda computada. Se debe prest ar atenci\u00f3n al pulso en casos de Wen Bin sin Calor: La presencia de Calor. Se revela con el pulso impetuoso. En caso de no dominar la semiolog\u00eda de pulso, contar la frecuencia diariamente. Ante la ausencia de Calor con aumento de pulsos por minuto, se d ebe prestar atenci\u00f3n a la aparici\u00f3n de fiebre alta s\u00fabita, semejando al estado previo del SIRS. En el texto original de \u00a8Shang Han Lun\u00a8 menciona el t\u00e9rmino fiebre alta s\u00fabita y se diagnostica con el pulso. El nivel de Humedad. Se revela de 3 formas: Prim ero, si el pulso es fino. Segundo, si el pulso es moderado. Prestar atenci\u00f3n a Yi Bing del Taiyin Bazo, por ejemplo la fiebre tifoidea intestinal, que se ve poco en Yi Bing del Taiyin Pulm\u00f3n Tercero, si el pulso es \u00e1spero y d\u00e9bil. Una manera para los princ ipiantes de MTC es ver si pueden sentir claramente bajo sus dedos cada pulsaci\u00f3n. De lo contrario puede estar relacionado con la Humedad. (El pulso \u00e1spero y d\u00e9bil no solo aparece en enfermedades de Humedad). F\u00edjese que la Humedad es un pat\u00f3geno Yin perver so mientas que el Calor, un pat\u00f3geno Yang perverso. La mayor\u00eda de las manifestaciones cl\u00ednicas de la Humedad y del Calor son contrapuestas: El pulso del Calor es rebosante, grande y r\u00e1pido; mientras que el de la Humedad es fino, d\u00e9bil y moderado (rebosante -d\u00e9bil, grande -fino, moderado -r\u00e1pido), totalmente opuestos. A pesar de que los pulsos se enmascaran entre s\u00ed, la presencia de saburra grues a grasienta y amarilla o el dorso de la lengua enrojecida indican gravedad igual de Humedad y Calor. Los aspectos de la lengua tambi\u00e9n se enmascaran entre s\u00ed. Cuando hay Humedad intensa, se ve lengua p\u00e1lida e Insuficiencia del Bazo, mientras que en el C alor intenso, lengua roja vinosa. La clave para diferenciar del Calor est\u00e1 en la punta de la lengua y en la saburra. Si hay Calor oculto, ver dorso de la lengua. La insuficiencia del Yin tambi\u00e9n se enmascara con la Humedad. El pulso de Humedad -Calor es f ino pero no hueco ( Kou), ya que la presencia de \u00e9ste indica Insuficiencia del Yin o de sangre. Cuando sufren de s\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor, en los individuos con insuficiencia de sangre constitucional, se produce una disminuci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de gl\u00f3bulos rojos, com o ocurre en los casos de glomerulonefritis cr\u00f3nica. Tener en cuenta la observaci\u00f3n de las grietas finas linguales. Los gloquidios tambi\u00e9n pueden ser enmascarados por la Insuficiencia del Bazo, particularmente en la punta de la lengua. Hay que prestar at enci\u00f3n que los abundantes gloquidios no enrojecidos indican d\u00e9ficit de Qi Recto, grupo de pacientes que fallecen f\u00e1cilmente ante infecci\u00f3n citot\u00f3xica por dis - minuci\u00f3n de su inmunidad. Sin embargo, ante una infecci\u00f3n viral no citot\u00f3 - xica (s\u00ed citol\u00edtica) s e desencadeuna un da\u00f1o inmunitario inflamatorio, que por la respuesta inmune deficiente, raras veces genera muerte s\u00fabita. Empero, facilita la persistencia de la enfermedad, que puede llevar a la muerte por sobreinfecci\u00f3n bacteriana o al desarrollo de la fibrosis una vez superada la fase aguda. Otros pueden cronificarse dependiendo de la naturaleza propia de la enfermedad. 2.2 Tratamiento 2.2.1 Elaboraci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula F\u00f3rmula Yin Chai Xiao Du Dan modificado. Ingredientes: Chai Hu 24g, 9g, Pei Lan 9g, Yin Chen 30g, Bai Dou Kou (agregar tarde) 6g, Dang Gui 9g, Dan Pi 9g, Yi Yi Ren 60g, Shi Shang Bo 30g, Shen Gan Cao 6g. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 105 2.2.2 Explicaci\u00f3n de la f\u00f3rmula Chai Hu m\u00e1s Huang Qin se usa en el Calor por afecci\u00f3n externa. Como Sanjiao es la ruta de los humores, Xiao Chai Hu Tang tambi\u00e9n se indica para la tonificaci\u00f3n de los movimientos de los l\u00edquidos corporales, as\u00ed como dice: \"Si el Jiao superior se desbloquea, los l\u00edqui dos y los humores bajan y entonces, el Qi del est\u00f3mago se armoniza y el Calor se libera por sudoraci\u00f3n lluviosa\". Se combina Jin Yin Hua con Lian Quio para liberar el pat\u00f3geno externo. La asociaci\u00f3n de Chang Pu con Yu Jin previene el deterioro hacia la fas e cr\u00edtica como la aparici\u00f3n de coma y convulsiones, conceptualmente entendido por la MTC de la siguiente manera: \"Una vez que el Calor superficial se interioriza, los meridianos colaterales profundos se bloquean\". La suma de Huo Xiang y Pei Lan transforman la Humedad por sus propiedades arom\u00e1ticas. Cabe destacar que Pei Lan es un medicamento espec\u00edfico para la inhibici\u00f3n de secre - ci\u00f3n de mucoprote\u00ednas, que tradicionalmente se indica para tratar boca pas - tosa y boca dulce en la MTC. Se puede usar hasta 20 -30g de Pei Lan para disminuir la secreci\u00f3n de grandes cantidades de mucoprote\u00ednas en el pulm\u00f3n, evitando las obstrucciones por flema. Yin Chen m\u00e1s Bai Dou Kou liberan la Humedad -Calor de Sanjiao. Dang Gui m\u00e1s Dan Pi protege la capa sangu\u00ednea. En caso de co nstipaci\u00f3n, agregar Zi Cao. Yi Yi Ren elimina la Humedad -Calor externa y es antiviral. Shi Shang Bo es espec\u00edfico para la infecci\u00f3n pulmonar. Sheng Gan Cao se usa para la desintoxicaci\u00f3n ya que el \u00e1cido glicirret\u00ednico posee propiedades antiinflamatorias si milares a los glucocorticoides. Chai Hu es bueno para eliminar el Calor. Jin Yin Hua tiene buen efecto contra el dolor de garganta. Se recomienda a\u00f1adir Pei Lan si hay s\u00edntomas gastrointestinales marcadas. Las propiedades espec\u00edficas del Yin Chai Xiao Du D an consiste en lo siguiente: Chai Hu m\u00e1s Huan Qin elimina Calor; Jin Yin Hua m\u00e1s Lian Qiao ex - pulsa el pat\u00f3geno a trav\u00e9s de la superficie y Pei Lan m\u00e1s Huo Xiang tonifica el est\u00f3mago. Se puede sustituir Jin Yin Hua por su roc\u00edo puesto que posee mejor prop iedad para liberar calor y evitar el bloqueo interno. 2.2.3 Modificaciones Debe prestarse especial atenci\u00f3n en pacientes con Insuficiencia del Yin, y evaluar la eliminaci\u00f3n de Chai Hu o en el peor de los casos sustituirlo por Sheng Di Huang 15g en pacient es que cursan con fiebre persistente por varios d\u00edas, ya que \u00e9ste puede secuestrar Yin de H\u00edgado. La Insuficiencia del Yin aparece a menudo en pacientes con fiebre, v\u00f3mito o diarrea persistente. Para el diagn\u00f3stico precoz de la Insuficiencia del Yin por S\u00ed ndrome Humedad -Calor hay que precisar si en la lengua existe peque\u00f1as grietas no constitucionales (explicado en la clase de inspecci\u00f3n de lengua las grietas constitucionales), que confirma la Insuficiencia. Hay 4 formas de abordaje para estos casos. Primer o, se aconseja quitar Chai Hu y agregar Sheng Di Huang para alimentar el Yin, de lo contrario, la Humedad -Calor dif\u00edcilmente reduce. Segundo, agregar Xuan Shen que potencia el cultivo del Yin. Se recomienda asociar Xuan Shen con Dang Gui 30g como antiinfla matorio (M\u00e9todo Si Miao Yong An Tang). Esto est\u00e1 contraindicado en pacientes en shock porque Xuan Shen y Dang Gui son vasodilatadores y bajan la presi\u00f3n arterial. Se ex - cepcionan su uso en casos con soporte vasopresor y monitoreo estricto conti - nuo, por lo que se desaconseja su empleo en principiantes. Tercero, sumar Lu Gen 30-50g. Este medicamento contiene coixenolida que facilita la eliminaci\u00f3n de Humedad y act\u00faa como antiviral; tambi\u00e9n con - tiene asparagina que potencia el cultivo del Yin y es antitus\u00ed gena; y vitamina B que regenera la saburra; y antipir\u00e9tica. Por \u00faltimo, agregar Zhi Mu cuando el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor deteriora el Yin y se acompa\u00f1a de Calor. La fiebre persistente agota la corteza adrenal o altera el ritmo circadiano de la secreci\u00f3n corticoidea. Zhi Mu protege la corteza adrenal (M\u00e9todos Bai Hu Tang y Da Yuan Yin) previniendo el deterioro del Yin por el S\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor. Por lo que se recomienda su uso en estos pacientes. Se recomienda incorporar Dan Zhu Ye 30g m\u00e1s Lu Gen 30g cuand o la Humedad es m\u00e1s intensa. Se recomienda incorporar Da Qing Ye 30g cuando el Calor es m\u00e1s intenso y Chen Pi 6 -9g como protector g\u00e1strico. Si a esta f\u00f3rmula se le a\u00f1ade Da Qing Ye, puede aparecer dolor abdominal, diarrea, falta de apetito en pacientes con Insuficiencia del Bazo, por lo que no se recomienda dosis altas. Solo Da Qing Ye 15g combinando con Chen Pi 9g o Cang Zhu 9g. Aunque altas dosis de Yi Yi Ren posee efectos antivirales marcados, pero enfr\u00eda el est\u00f3mago, entonces, se recomienda agregar Chen Pi. 2.3 Evoluci\u00f3n Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 106 La primera evoluci\u00f3n es hacia la fase cr\u00edtica de tipo severo. La segunda es la mejor\u00eda post tratamiento. La tercera es la aparici\u00f3n de Insuficiencia del Bazo m\u00e1s Humedad intensa luego de la mejor\u00eda posterior a la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor por Represi\u00f3n de Humedad. Cl\u00ednicamente se manifiesta el cambio de saburra a blanca, y la lengua a p\u00e1lida. En este momento de desaparici\u00f3n de calor, hay que indicar la f\u00f3rmula de fase temprana, sustituyendo Gui Zhi por Rou Gui 3g en decocciones o Rou Gui 1 g v\u00eda oral y agregar hierbas que dispersan calor tales como Hua Shi, Han Shui Shi, etc. Si vuelve el Calor, reiniciar la f\u00f3rmula de fase intermedia, y as\u00ed viceversa. Ante la inexistencia de Insuficiencia del Bazo y de lengua p\u00e1lida, no se recomienda aborda r de esta manera. La cuarta evoluci\u00f3n consiste en la persistencia de Humedad -Calor. Debido a que la Humedad es un pat\u00f3geno Yin perverso, no se disuelve si no es con Calor. Pacientes con marcada Insuficiencia del Bazo que no muestra clara respuesta de trans formaci\u00f3n de Humedad luego de recibir esta f\u00f3rmula, se recomienda rotar a f\u00f3rmula de fase temprana, sustituyendo Gui Zhi por Rou Gui 3g en decocciones o Rou Gui 1g v\u00eda oral y agregar hierbas que dispersan calor tales como Hua Shi, Han Shui Shi, etc y monit orizar estrictamente la respuesta inflamatoria. 3.Fase Huai Bing Huai Huai Bing se asemeja a la fase cr\u00edtica de la medicina contempor\u00e1nea. Esta enfermedad tiene dos tipos de presentaciones: el primero, de tipo fulmi - nante, donde el paciente debuta en fase cr\u00edtica y se observa principalmente cuando existe el Calor T\u00f3xico Candente. Este grupo de paciente evoluciona de manera r\u00e1pida y t\u00f3rpida hacia la muerte en poco tiempo, inclusive en mi - nutos cuando haya bloqueo interno del pericardio; el segundo es de ti po co - m\u00fan, donde las fases iniciales tienen un per\u00edodo prolongado hasta que el pa - ciente alcance el punto cr\u00edtico y desarrolle velozmente la transformaci\u00f3n en Calor con pronto deterioro de la enfermedad. Este estado cr\u00edtico requiere una atenci\u00f3n urgente y aparece muchas veces por haber ignorado las fases inicia - les demasiado estables. Cl\u00ednicamente en Huai Bing (fase cr\u00edtica) se observan insuficiencia card\u00edaca, insuficiencia respiratoria e insuficiencia renal, con disfunci\u00f3n hep\u00e1tica, gastrointestinal y t rastorno de la coagulaci\u00f3n que requiere reanimaci\u00f3n ur - gente. Frecuentemente se encuentra una disociaci\u00f3n entre el alivio sintom\u00e1tico y el curso de la enfermedad en Yi Bing. Para determinar el punto cr\u00edtico, hay que examinar si la saburra lingual pertenec e al Calor intenso de Yangming. En casos no fulminantes el punto cr\u00edtico generalmente est\u00e1 alrededor del d\u00e9cimo d\u00eda, mientras que si no hubo deterioro luego de 14 d\u00edas, comparativamente est\u00e1n fuera de peligro. Las formas de diagnosticar Huai Bing son: Prim ero, examinar si existe gran cantidad de gloquidios en la lengua ya que esto indica la profundizaci\u00f3n de la enfermedad a la capa sangu\u00ednea y ha ge - nerado cierto grado de hemorragia. Segundo, examinar la presencia o no de pulso cuerda filosa, que indica co nvulsi\u00f3n debido a la Agitaci\u00f3n Interna del Viento. La saburra lingual tam - bi\u00e9n aporta en el diagn\u00f3stico: es blanca, de capa gruesa y s\u00edmil polvo en Hu - medad intensa, mientras que es amarilla, de capa gruesa y seca, o exfoliada en Calor intenso. Ambos ind ican la persistencia de la enfermedad con proba - bilidad de deterioro hacia la fase cr\u00edtica. La textura oscura y p\u00farpura de la lengua se\u00f1ala hipercoagulabilidad causada por la infecci\u00f3n si no fuese por \u00e9stasis sangu\u00ednea constitucional. En este caso, la pro gresi\u00f3n de la enfermedad suele ser m\u00e1s lenta. En la aparici\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de lengua oscura y p\u00farpura en Wen Bing de Taiyin Pulmonar se debe descartar la baja saturaci\u00f3n de ox\u00edgeno, indicador de gravedad en enferme - dades pulmonares, del \u00e9stasis sangu\u00ednea causad a por Calor ferviente. Este \u00faltimo puede generar hemorragias por lo que se recomienda agregar Qian Cao 30g, Zi Cao 9g, Guan Zhong 15g, o directamente la f\u00f3rmula Shen Xi Dan de \u00a8Wen Re Jing Wei. \u00a8 En comparaci\u00f3n, la dificultad respiratoria m\u00e1s la semiolog\u00eda de lengua y pulso son determinantes m\u00e1s espec\u00edficos que los s\u00edntomas gastrointestinales, la tos, el esputo y la fiebre para definir el avance de la enfermedad. Ante la aparici\u00f3n de dificultad respiratoria, en medios accesibles, hay que monitorear la satur aci\u00f3n de ox\u00edgeno y efectuar r\u00e1pidamente radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax o tomo - graf\u00eda computada para esclarecer el estado pulmonar. En caso de falla respi - ratoria derivar de modo urgente al servicio de emergencias. Se recomienda agregar Ma Huang 9g con acci\u00f3n anti -choque, y la dosis puede alcanzar hasta 30 -40g seg\u00fan la tensi\u00f3n arterial; as\u00ed como las f\u00f3rmulas Ma Xing Shi Gan Tang, Ma Xing Yi Gan Tang y Ma Huang Lian Qiao Chi Xiao Dou Tang, \u00e9ste \u00faltimo con buen efecto protector de da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico post infecci\u00f3n viral. L a efedrina tiene acci\u00f3n s\u00edmil adrenalina. Ma Huang Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 107 Sheng Ma Tang es una f\u00f3rmula est\u00e1ndar de MTC para tratar infecciones graves. Dicha f\u00f3rmula trata las infecciones severas y a los 6 meridianos en simult\u00e1neo. Para su indicaci\u00f3n hay que modificarla seg\u00fan sig no sintomatolog\u00eda. Se recomienda la posibilidad de aplicaci\u00f3n de inyectables anti insuficiencia card\u00edaca como Ren Shen, Fu Zi, Yu Zhu, Shen Fu o Sheng Ma Por otro lado, pese a que Ban Bian Lian tiene efecto espec\u00edfico contra la falla respiratoria de origen central, no se recomienda su uso en esta enfermedad por sus resul - tados desalentadores especialmente en pacientes con alteraci\u00f3n del sensorio y convulsiones. El \u00e1cido glicirret\u00ednico es un s\u00edmil glucocorticoides. En caso de no contar con otra medicaci\u00f3n a ntiinflamatoria, sustituir los glucocorticoides por altas dosis de Gan Cao 30g que tiene efecto antiinflamatorio potente. No obstante, a\u00f1a - dir medicaci\u00f3n evacuadora de agua como Chen Pi y Fu Ling para antagonizar los efectos adversos de Gan Cao. Chang Pu y Yu Jin son buenas opciones para prevenir la fase cr\u00edtica ya que evita el coma y las convulsiones, precedidas por la opresi\u00f3n precordial de la fase temprana as\u00ed como lo explica \"Una vez que el Calor superficial se interio - riza, los meridianos colaterales profundos se bloquean.\" Una vez instalado el coma y las convulsiones, el tratamiento urgente tradicional de MTC son los \"Tres Tesoros.\" El los pacientes que sufren da\u00f1o del Yin por el s\u00edndrome Humedad -Calor se recomienda indicar f\u00f3rmula Jia Wei Bai He Di Huang Tang (Bai He, Sheng Di, Zhu Ye, Shi Gao y Dan Pi) m\u00e1s Hua Shi y Gan Cao con efecto anal\u00e9ptico marcado. Se recomienda agregar Jiang Nan Quan Bo 30g de inmediato sin otras evaluaciones en el marco de derrame peric\u00e1rdico o derrame pleural secunda - rio a la extravasaci\u00f3n de l\u00edquido. Chan Tui es un estimulante de la s\u00edntesis de IFN y posee efecto antiviral potente como por ejemplo en la f\u00f3rmula Sheng Jiang San. Se puede usar altas dosis de 30-40g, pero hay que tener extrema precauci\u00f3n en casos severos. No se recomienda indicarlo en contexto de respuesta inflamatoria exagerada ni tampoco se recomienda su uso si no fueran expertos tanto en W\u00e9n Bing Xue de MTC como en Infectolog\u00eda de medicina alop\u00e1tica. 4. Fase secuelar La secuela principal de esta enfermedad es el desarrollo de la fibrosis pulmonar. En este contexto se indica Yu Ke Tang (Xiang Fu, Xuan Fu Hua, Yi Yi Ren, Tao Ren, Dang Gui, Wu Gong, San Qi, Bai Jie Zi) de la f\u00f3rmula de Wu Men. Contemplando los efectos adversos de cada medicina, se puede adicion ar Shan Ci Gu, Shang Lu, Zao Jiao Ci seg\u00fan signo -sintomatolog\u00eda. Los que sufren de enfisema pulmonar deben tomar Tai Yi Xi Sui Gao durante 3 a\u00f1os sucesivos. Para conocer su uso espec\u00edfico, consulte el libro Wu Men Yan Fang (F\u00f3rmulas eficaces de la familia Wu). 5. Prevenci\u00f3n y medidas higi\u00e9nico -diet\u00e9ticas 5.1 Prevenci\u00f3n Optimizar la ventilaci\u00f3n ambiental; evitar la concurrencia a lugares de concentraci\u00f3n multitudinaria; prevenir el contacto con pacientes infectados; y a\u00fan m\u00e1s importante, evitar el cansancio y el estr\u00e9s. Es fundamental el la - vado de manos con frecuencia y el uso de barbijos. Es necesario considerar la alta infectividad de Yi Bing y Li Bing, as\u00ed como los antiguos chinos lo denominaban \"enfermedades de f\u00e1cil contagio\". Bajo estas condiciones, la inmunocompetencia de los individuos sanos es insufi - ciente para no contraer esta enfermedad. Entonces, tampoco encuadra el concepto de \"Si conserva Qi Recto en el interior, el Qi Pat\u00f3geno perverso no puede invadir\" en esta patolog\u00eda de alta infectivida d, por ende, es sustancial evitar el contacto cercano. La MTC sugiere alimentar la energ\u00eda en postura sentada (Qigong y meditaci\u00f3n sm - bandha), prender incienso (incluye el uso de sachet arom\u00e1tica) y evitar el miasma, medicamentos como Xiao Jin Dan de Nei jing. Seg\u00fan este mismo protocolo, se puede alternar la indicaci\u00f3n de f\u00f3rmulas de fase tem - prana e intermedia seg\u00fan la constituci\u00f3n f\u00edsica de cada paciente y el nivel de exposici\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n se puede digitopuntar la planta del pie (centro del aca - punto Yon Quan, K1, 81 veces) y el arco del pie (en el centro acupunto de Ran Gu, K2, 81 veces, o simplemente de 5 a 10 minutos). Adem\u00e1s, hay que tener mucha cautela el contacto con pacientes conva - lecientes hasta los 14 d\u00edas posteriores ya que permanecen con infe ctividad activa. Por el momento, tampoco se puede descartar la posibilidad de con - vertirse en portadores cr\u00f3nicos en algunos casos espor\u00e1dicos. La clave reside en el pulso: a los que a\u00fan conservan el pulso impetuoso a la palpaci\u00f3n media y profunda, pese a la mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica e imagenol\u00f3gica, ll\u00e1mese curado, tienen mayor probabilidad de transformarse en portador cr\u00f3nico. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 108 5.2 Medidas higi\u00e9nico -diet\u00e9ticas Dieta: caldo de arroz y gran cantidad de verduras. Evitar comidas grasientas, dulzonas y bebidas fr\u00edas. Es importante mantener un buen ritmo eva - cuatorio. Evitar agotamiento f\u00edsico, mental y sexual. Se recomienda abstinencia sexual hasta 14 d\u00edas posteriores a la convalecencia. 6. Instructivo de la gu\u00eda 6.1 Puntos claves para el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamient o: El punto clave para diferenciar y tratar las enfermedades Wen Bing reside en dilucidar el mecanismo fisiopatol\u00f3gico principal. Cuantos m\u00e1s tipos de s\u00edn - dromes se describa por esta enfermedad m\u00e1s lejos estamos de la esencia de Wen Bing. Con respecto a e sto, lo mejor es lograr una hierba por enfermedad, o si no fuera posible, una f\u00f3rmula. A\u00fan no poder conseguirlo, hay que definir por lo menos el s\u00edndrome central seg\u00fan el mecanismo fisiopatol\u00f3gico princi - pal. Aunque cl\u00ednicamente diferentes factores originar\u00e1n m\u00faltiples tipos de s\u00edndromes paralelos o transformantes capaces de influir en el pron\u00f3stico, no obstante, no reflejan la esencia propia de la enfermedad. Es considerable mejorar el s\u00edndrome, compuesto por signos y s\u00edntomas, mientras que es im - prescindible el tratamiento dirigido desde la MTC a la noxa causante de Wen Bing y Li Bing y al mecanismo fisiopatol\u00f3gico principal. Debido a que la noxa de cada enfermedad infecto -contagiosa es \u00fanica, su mecanismo fi siopatol\u00f3gico central es relativamente homog\u00e9nea, por lo que miles de variaciones no se alejan del eje. 6.2 Pron\u00f3stico Es frecuente la disociaci\u00f3n entre la mejor\u00eda cl\u00ednica sintomatol\u00f3gica y el avance de la enfermedad en Wen Bing e Yi Bing severos. Esto qui ere decir que la evoluci\u00f3n sindrom\u00e1tica y el curso de la enfermedad son disicr\u00f3nicos. Con - cretamente, el cambio de la semiolog\u00eda lingual y del pulso es crucial y, a veces superiores, que los s\u00edntomas para la determinaci\u00f3n del pron\u00f3stico. 6.3 Integraci\u00f3n M edicina Tradicional China - Medicina Alop\u00e1tica Se recomienda la integraci\u00f3n de la Medicina Tradicional China con la Medicina Alop\u00e1tica para la prevenci\u00f3n y el tratamiento de Wen Bing e Yi Bing. Es necesario que la MTC se fusione con la Infectolog\u00eda y la Te rapia Intensiva y adem\u00e1s, con las \u00e1reas de vacunaci\u00f3n, aislamiento, desifecci\u00f3n, prevenci\u00f3n, tratamiento de soporte y Emergentolog\u00eda de la medicina contempor\u00e1nea.

The supportive care and non -specific treatment to ameli orate the symptoms of the patient are the only options currently. At the top of these conventional therapies, greater than 85% of SARS -CoV-2 China are receiving Traditional literatures are thoroughly reviewed and current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID -19 patients are analyzed. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV, and the widely use of TCM in the treatment of SARS -CoV, the clinical evidence showing the beneficial effect of of with coronaviral infections are discussed. Current Introduction was a outbreak unexplainable pneumonia in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China [1]. By Jan 7, 2020, it was confirmed that a new type of coronavirus named SARS -CoV-2 (formerly named as 2019 -nCoV) had emerged [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the Wu han pneumonia as Coronavirus Disease -2019 (COVID -19) on Feb 11, patients showed typical respiratory symptom (such such fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea [4, February 17, 2020, a total of 73,332 cases of the SARS -CoV-2 infected pneumonia has been reported in China and 25 other countries, of which 72,528 cases was found in China [6]. Due to the rapid spread of SARS -CoV-2 through human -to-human transmission, of SARS -CoV- 2 and SARS -CoV enters human epitelial binding angiotensin -converting 2 (ACE2) or vaccines currently for the treatment [10, 11]. According to Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 110 coronaviral will be summarized and benefits. Conventional treatment of SARS -CoV-2: is there a room for Chinese medicine? Due to the absence of a specific antiviraltherapeutics and vaccine, main treatment strategy for COVID -19 is supportive care, which is supplemented by the combination appropriate antibiotics or w ith the treatment of -19, since for as influenza [19]. A recent in vitro study that it had the anti -SARS -CoV-2 activity [20], but the in vivo effect remains Remdesivir may be the most promising antiviral dr ug for treating COVID -19. It has in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against a wide array of RNA viruses including SARS and MERS [21], and could decrease viral loads and pathology of and most symptoms of under clinical trial to evaluate the saf ety and efficacy of intravenous remdesivir for patients with SARS -CoV-2 infection [24]. Oral oseltamivir has been used for the treatment of the cases with SARS -CoV-2 [7], while its efficacy currently remains uncertain. Host -targeted small molecules approved for other human diseases -CoV-2 activity [20]. Its clinical efficacy is und in an open -label trial (ChiCTR2000029609) [12]. IFN (5 million to A no evidence showing t hat the mortality of SARS and MERS patients was reduced by the treatment with corticosteroids, while the clearance of was delayed -CoV infection, convalescent plasma treatment could the mortality [31, has in China [22], Consistent with previous analysis, recommended to prevent or treat SARS -CoV-2\" [37]. M been used in control of infectious diseases for thousands of years. There is a clear room for the intervention of TCM as a complementary therapy for COVID -19 It reported expectation that TCM would be a valuable weapon in the armory against SARS -CoV- 2. Traditional Chinese Medicine in the treat ment of infected with SARS -CoV: clinical evidence Application of TCM in the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 is largely inspired by the treatment of SARS caused by outbreak of SARS coronavirus (SARS -CoV) in the late of 2002 in the Guangdong Province of Ch ina which spread rapidly during the 2003, with the cumulative number over 8,000 [41 carried out and reported. There are quite notion has beneficial in the treatment or prevention of SARS. For example, the Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 111 rate of fatality in Hong Kong and Singapore was approximately 18 %, while the rate for Beijing was initially more than 52% until the 5th of May and decreased gradually to 4% -1% after the 20th of May in 2003. The dramatic reduced fatality from late May in Beijing was believed to be associated with the use of TCM as a supplement to the conventional including 926 workers and 37 laboratory technicians working in high -risk virus laboratories used a TCM herbal extract, namely Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San. Compared with the 0.4% of infection in the control group, none of TCM users infected. Furthermore, there was some evidence that Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San could modulate T cells in a manner to enhance studies. For exam ple, a high -profile research published in the Lancet reported that glycyrrhizin, a major active constituent liquorice root which is the most frequently the replication SARS i antivirus activity of glycyrrhizin by plaque reduction assays and this study found that another Chinese compound baicalin also had the anti-SARS activity [49]. Furthermore, derived from TCM, may become a lead compound for SARS therapy by inhibition of cathepsin L, a target for the treatment of SARS [50]. There is a myriad of literature on TCM treatments for SARS published after the SARS epidemicin China. A critical analysis of thesep ublications to of fungal infections in patients with SARS. However, the evidence is not sufficient enough due to the poor quality of methodology the publications and concluded that with conventional treatment had some better control symptoms. -quality clinical studies are required another thorough literatura analysis, Liu and colleagues concluded that there was no benefit of adjuvant treatment with TCM in terms of mortality [39]. Due to the lack hig quality trials and biases Chinese Medicine Natural products used in TCM remains to be a wealthy source for the identification of noveltherapeuticagents for the treatment of human diseases [52]. In the past decade, scientists have made a considerable effort to identif y multiple also pursued (Table 3). Due to the and SARS -CoV-2, these target of MERSCoV 3CL protease [60] Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 112 Du Bu performed with infection of SARS -CoV, or or COVID -19. Thus, anti cell (PBMC) [79]. In line with shown to markedly Long strong antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, as shown by a study base d on the observation of influenza H5N1 virus -infected human macrophages and type -I alveolar epithelial cells [81]. Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule was reported to have in vitro activity in inhibition of various TCM herbal p roduct not only blocked the early stages of influenza virus infection but also inhibited virus -induced gene expression of IL -a, IP -10, and MCP -1 [82]. Additionally, a study by Dong et al. reported that the levels of IL -8, TNF -, IL-17, and IL -23 in the sputum and of IL -8 and IL -17 in the blood were markedly decreased after Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule adm inistration of the TCM herbal formulas (Sang Ju Yin and Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 113 Yu Ping Feng San) may have beneficial immunomodulatory effects for from T CM herbs, although the mechanisms of action have not yet example, patients: the current situations TCM is highly valued by go vernment of in their campaign to contain and eradiate SARS -CoV-2. For example, should be used in combination with conventional medicine in the treatment of COVID -19 patients. On 17, February, National Health Commission (NHC) of the People's Republic of China reported that 60,107 confirmed COVID -19 patients (85.20% cases) had been treated with TCM [87]. As for March 1, 2020, a total of 303 ongoing clinical trials aim ing to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments for CoV -19 patients have been launched in China. Among them, 50 trials (16.5%) are about the use of TCM, including 14 cases (4.6%) to examine the effect of combined treatment with TCM and Western medici ne. In 22 TCM trials (7.3%), Guan -1 Formula, Xin Guan -2 Formula and Qing Yi -4 are 14 TCM trials Lian H ua Qing Wen Capsule are studied (Table 4). To date, NHC has published 6 editions Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID -19 [88]. Since the fourth versions, different herbal medicinesused in TCM system has been recommended for the treatment of COVI herbal Zheng Hua Qing Wen Capsule, Shu Feng Jie Du Capsule and Jin Hua Qing Gan Granule. In the clinical treatment period, Qing Fei Pai Du Tang, Xi Yan Ping Injection, Xue Bi Jing injection, Re Du Ning Injection, Tan Re Qing Injection Xing Nao. Jing [90]. Mai Injection, Shen Mai Injection, Su He Xiang Pill and An Gong Niu Huang P ill should be administered (Table 5). Through analysis of the frequency of TCM used in 23 were 10 most commonly used Chinese herbs in the treatment of COVID -19. Xu, et al. [91] reported that Astragalus membranaceus and Yu Ping Feng were used in the 13 prevention programs (in Beijing, Tianjin, et al.) for \"reinforcing vital qi\", a terminology used in Chinese property of \"aromatic dehumidification\" were commonly used in southern China (Table 6). Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 114 According t o the report of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, up to February 5th, 2020, 214 COVID -19 patients were treated with Qing Fei Pai Du Tang in Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Shaanxi Provinces with overall (60%) improved, while illness of others (30%) was stabilized [92]. After that, 701 COVID -19 patients were treated with Qing Fei Pai Du Tang in 10 provinces in China. The result showed that 130 patient s were completely characteristic symptoms 212 patients (30.2%), respectively [87]. 94] retrospectively analyzed the clinical efficacy of Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule in treatment of confirmed and suspected COVID - 19 patients. The results indicate d that this herbal product could markedly relieve major symptoms such as fever and cough and had the capacity to promote the recovery. Some patients with mild with organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which was associated with cytokine storm [95]. There is compelling evidence that some its components have potent -103]. For example, Wang, that Shen Fu Injection could inhibit the lung inflammation and decrease the levels of IL -1, IL-6 and other cytokines. Chang, et al. [105] reported that Re Du Ning Injection could markedly red uce the levels of IL -1, TNF -, IL-8, IL -10, and some other cytokines ofLPS that its devastating consequences may be harnessed in the treatment of severe COVID -19 patients. Currently, the laboratory study on the effect ofT CM isapparently lagging behind the clinical application of TCM in the treatment of COVID -19 patients. Nevertheless, some have started products or its components on SARS -CoV-2 in their laboratories. For example, a n in vitro study showed that Shuang Huang However, its clinical efficacy and safety for thetreatment of COVID -19 patients has not been evaluated. We noticed that this was not Chen and Du thus performed the molecular docking study and they have the capacity to inhibit the infection o f SARS - of TCM or its Closing remarks alternative treatments are still SARS -CoV-2 infection, experiencesin TCM is certainly worth learning. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 115 Fighting against current epidemics also provide an opportunity t o test the TCM in treating -controlled is the best way to provide the most reliable evidence for a therapy,including encouraging clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of TCM in treatment of SARS -CoV were conducted and reported. However, the most of these studies were found to be poorly designed evaluate the effect of on COVID -19 will use more strict protocols, concealment of allocation, and double -blinding, in compliance the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM in the treatment of COVID -19. The further study of TCM may lead to the identification of novel anti human coronavirus compounds that may eventually prove to be useful in the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 or other emerging fatal viral diseases as conventional therapeutic agents. The safety of TCM in the treatment of emer ging coronavirus diseases was not included in the observation on SARS patients [13].

In the second step we searched Chinese the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results: Of the exist in traditional Chinese -nCoV Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to con tain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 treatments were related to regulating viral infection, Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 122 immune/inflammation this article as: Zhang DH, Wu KL, Zha ng X, Deng SQ, Peng B. In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel Toward of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) with human -to-human transmission and severe human infection, originating Wuhan, China, was identified [1]. This virus has affected many persons in China and spread to other countries in a very short time. On January 30, 2020, the Director -General of the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak of 2019 -nCoV constitutes a emergency of international concern recommendations under Health Regulations [2]. According to the Daily Repor t of China National Health Commission, as of this writing on February 2, 2020, 14,488 cases, including 304 deaths, have been confirmed in China; cases, including 1 death, have also been reported among 23 other countries. This pandemic is ongoing, is risk, strong measures for early detection, isolation and treatment of cases, as well as minimization of transmission through social inter action must be implemented. While specific vaccines and antiviral agents are methods to prevent and treat viral infection, there are not yet effective treatments that target the 2019 -nCoV. Development of this treatment may require month s or years, meaning that a more immediate treatment or control mechanism should be found if possible. medicine present a potentially valuable resource to this end. The effectiveness of herbal treatment to control contagiou s is encouraging the use of herbal plants in fighting this new viral pneumonia. However, the application of herbal treatment is mainly guided by the type of herb (based on the catalogue of classic literature on herbs) and the patient's symptoms or signs. There is often not enough information to predetermine whether the herbs in question can directly target the viral cause, in other words, herbal usage is generally not guided by viral pathology. We think more detailed knowledge about the direct antiviral effects of plants would be greatly helpful selecting them. In fact, after the outbreak of SARS, many group s dedicated themselves to finding anti - coronavirus agents, including in encodes than one proteins, some which to protein uses angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 as a receptor to help the virus enter cells [16]. These three proteins make attractive targets in ocessing, a series of small molecules, those compounds, have to directly inhibit proteins East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [17 -23]. The gene sequence of 2019 -nCoV has been released, which suggests high similarities between the main proteins in this virus and those previously identified in SARS -Cov or MERS - Cov [24,25]. In this sense, previously anti to treat viral pneumonia. It is a challenge to screen out the herbs containing anti -coronavirus (2019 - Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 123 nCoV) compounds from the large number of t used for patients infected with this pathogen, especially in very short time. Here, we propose two principles to guide such work: oral effectiveness and compatibility. The first principle refers to the fact that most Chinese herbal plan ts are orally ingested after boiling with water, meaning that -nCoV) in selected plants should be traditional herbal usage, since type -guided applications are integral to herbal use, as mentioned above. Following these two principles, we used and other methods to identify herbs that have both a -coronavirus infection . 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Literature search and compound selection PubMed literature concerning natural compounds against SARS or MERS coronavirus activity was selected using the query \"coronavirus AND inhibitor AND (SARS OR MERS OR SA RS-CoV OR MERS -CoV).\" After careful reading of the studies returned by this search, the natural compounds that had biologically confirmed antiviral activities were SymMap (https://www.symmap.org/). Natural activity and contained in herbs were examin ed in the next step of our study. 2.2. ADME screening of natural compounds Since Chinese herbal treatments are always taken orally after boiling with water, an of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) was use d to screen for natural compounds that may be bioactive via oral administration. The indices used for the screening for four indices were > 30%, > -0.4, > 0.18 and > 3 h, respectively, as recommended by Hu et al [26]. The values of these four indices can be obtained the database. structure files proteins. the -MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) to the corresponding from SARS -CoV. The models built were of Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. (2) To retrieve the required 3D s tructure files of compounds, data (SDF) format of compounds were retrieved from the PubChem website and then converted to PDB format by Discovery Studio. (3) AutoDock 4.2 was used to prepare PDBQT format containing that input and the plants were filtered by the numbers of antiviral compounds they contain. Those containing 2 or more antiviral compounds were selected for the next step. (2) Classic urther study. (3) Predication of general effects in vivo with network pharmacology analysis, which is detailed as follows. 2.5. Network pharmacology analysis The TCMSP provided main of and for identifie d the reported chemical constituents for each plant in the final analysis and used ADME of these compounds were downloaded from the TCMSP data base. All protein targets for each individual plant were used as input server (https://string -db.org/) to perform protein -protein interaction Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 124 analysis and pathway enrichment. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enr iched (with P < 0.01) input were downloaded. All data were processed using the statistical language R (3.6.2), unless otherwise Results 3.1. Overlapping of natural to be anti -SARS or anti -MERS coronavi rus in literature and in Chinese herbal database We received 261 hits from conducting our search in the PubMed database. After careful evaluation of the abstracts from these citations we downloaded carefully analyzed the full text of 23 highly papers. The natural compounds reported to have biologically anti - coronavirus activity were identified and then compared to the ingredients listed in TCMSP. The result was 115 overlapping ingredients, which we used for further testing (Fig. 1). 3.2. Filtration of compounds selected by ADME The antiviral activities systems. To be utilized as a Chinese herbal medicine, they must be absor bable via oral prescription. Therefore, we performed 115 natural reducing the of candidates to their If the molecules were reported were analysis M10, M11 and M13) mainly bound in the between the thumb and palm domains, which enzyme's [29]. The molecules reported to and M13) mainly entered the region between domains 2 and 3, and this region is important for 3CLpro to form a dimmer to bit viral entry, accordingly it bound the cone of spike protein; cone structure is important for viral membrane (Fig. 2 and online supplementary Fig. S1). Table Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 125 3.4. Selection of antiviral herbal plants The 13 molecules passing the three -round selection process were then compared to the three Chinese herbal databases, and we found 230 herbs containing these molecules file evaluated these herbs for those containing 2 or more of the 13 natur al compounds, leaving 125 results. We cross -referenced the 125 results with the classic for herbal usage in the database, viral respiratory infections. There are 26 herbal plants within the 11 types. The timeframe during the course of a viral infection that each these 26 herbal plants (Table be was from senior practitioners of traditional drugs warming group may be best utilized in prevention. 3. 5. Network analysis of possible of contains many ingredients in addition to the antiviral ones found here. To evaluate the possible general in vivo effects of each then extracted the target proteins for each ingredie nt which had passed the screening process. All proteins belonging to a single plant were combined as input on the online protein -protein interaction analysis server, String, to find the pathway enrichment. For the 26 herbs, about 1/3 of the top 30 KEGG -enriched pathways infection (Fig. 3 and online supplementary Fig. S2). Note that some of the herbal plants selected here had been reported to be effective infection combining of all of the orally absorbable and biologically active ingredients in it. Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 126 4. Discussion In this work, we undertook a multiple step selection process and screened out 26 herbal plants with a high probability of directly inhibiting the novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV), possibly pro viding instant help in the prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that it can cause. While mainly in China at this point, viral spread is ongoing and has affect persons worldwide. Two principles guided our screening work. The first is that the anti-coro navirus (2019 -nCoV) components contained natural co mpounds pass drug -likeness extracted natural compounds verified in PubMed as being effective in treating SARS or MERS coronavirus and then cr oss- checked these compounds in the Chinese herbal databases. There were 115 overlapping compounds. This method was an expeditious way to identify natural components both pre -existing in Chinese herbal treatment and having a high possibility of anti -coronav irus (2019 This been the genetic similarities between coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) and SARS or MERS coronavirus are high [24,25]. The anti -coronavirus effects of the natural does in vivo, especially with oral preparation \u2014the principal way i n which Chinese herbals are administered. Therefore, to meet the first principle, we ran ADME filters on the natural compounds selected by 4 indices, as used by Hu et al [26]. Among the 115 compounds highlighted by our first step, only 13 passed this scree ning, showing the necessity of such a test. The novel coronavirus has some mutations when compared to SARS or MERS coronavirus, so the natural compounds effectiveness against the two previous coronaviruses might not be present in the new virus. To reduce t his risk, and as the third step of our first principle, we reconstructed the 3D structure of the new coronavirus using the reported structures of SARS and MERS coronavirus proteins as a guide, and then used molecular docking technology to simulate whether the 13 natural compounds selected could combine with the structures we constructed for the new coronavirus proteins. All 13 compounds could bind to the proteins as predicted for the new coronavirus. We believe that the high success rate of our docking scre ening was due to the high genetic similarity between the new coronavirus and the SARS or MERS virus [24,25]. Our second principle for screening should also be emphasized and elaborated upon. It states herbal plants must conform to traditi onal usages. There many of Chinese herbs that have been used for thousands of years. Based on this rich history and experience, Chinese herbal medicines are divided into different types, each as further condition for the medicine screened here, we verified that they have been routinely used to treat viral pneumonia. To meet this principle, we conducted another three -step s creening process for the herbal plants. First, we searched the Chinese medicine database compounds were selected, and a total of 125 herbal pl ants were identified. The second step in targeted plant selection was based on type classification. Of the 125 results, only 26 herbs were found be treating Because Chinese herbal medicines contain many ingredients, and Tratamiento en Medicina Tradicional China de COVID -19 | Fundaci\u00f3n Europea de MTC 127 multiple absorbable ingredients might exert their effects on the body, the general effects of herbs may be dictated by all of the absorbable ingredients they contain. With this consideration in mind, we extracted the recorded ingredients of each of the plants selected from the Chinese medicine database and screened these ingredients for drug -likeness and (vi a ADME proteins of ingredients selection were used for network enrichment to predict the general effects of the herbal plants. For all the plants analyzed, nearly half of the top 30 In fact, some the herbal plants selected had been reported effective in against in 2003 (on line supplementary Table S2). that the general antiviral effects predicted for the 26 plants are fact that these plants were selected according to Chinese herbal type classifications. Of course, it sho uld be pointed out that Chinese herbs that have not been identified through this screening process may still have literature cannot cover all antivir al natural compounds, and the natural compounds included in the Chinese medicine database are not complete, the process that we have followed may have excluded herbs that be well suited to this treatment. Nevertheless, the purpose of this screening w as to provide a rational approach for selecting Chinese herbal medicines with patients' manifestations. Finally, t he key step in this screening was molecular docking. The 3D structures of the proteins used here are on reported gene sequences. If the virus mutates during transmission, a new screening is recommended. In conclusion, this work has identified principles and methods which may and all the work processes.
