Kansas Human Nutrition Mark Haub of this review role of heart rate variability (HRV) as can be implemented to create indices with the goal of improving athletic readiness and performance. The balance between training and recovery is crucial for reaching an optimal adaptation and avoiding overtraining, HRV is non-invasive and is used primarily mental in athletes by monitoring the effects of the autonomic nervous system on the heart. Current data suggests a relationship between resting parasympathetic tone, via domains, and athletic performance. Parasympathetic modulated HRV indices have with performance metrics such as peripheral work capacity, aerobic power, running swimming performance, weight performance, anaerobic capacity, strength, and enhanced focus/skill execution. The use of nutrition to help enhance sports performance is becoming more common. sports and aids injury recovery. The use of nutrition strategies to influence HRV is novel and current evidence scarce in regards to nutritional effects on HRV, specifically in Current research suggests energy decreasing body fat Much done in regard to potential nutritional influences on HRV so used to further improve the an athlete.

Its efficacy will be tested through questionnaires and by checking the balance of the Autonomic Nervous System through HRV analysis. To carry out this general objective, we conducted two main studies. We will analyse the AR effects over the heart rate variability (HRV) as a marker of the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance from the ANS. The objective for Study 1 was to analyse the AR efficacy for reducing anxiety and improving study concentration in university students. The sample was composed by 12 students (age between 18 and 33 years old). We analysed the effects of basil essential oil inhalation at short-time (1 a session or with an aromatic necklace every day objective for Study 2 was to analyse the aromatherapy efficacy to improve the work performance and reduce the workplace stress. The was 42.21 years, SD=7.12; gender: 10 men and 32 women). All sessions were performed in a university computer classroom. The participants were randomly assigned into an aromatherapy group (AG) and a control group (CG), and they were invited to participate in a specific session only once. They were seated in front of a computer. During the intervention period, some oil diffusers were launched and worked throughout the session with petit grain essential oil for AG sessions and a neutral oil (almond) for CG sessions. At the same time, participants completed a computer task in a specific website typing on their keyboard until they finished it. The single times were different for all participants and were recorded in the website as \"Performance Time\". The aromatherapy group performed the website task with the keyboard 2, 28 min the workplace. AR improves the performance time when typing with the keyboard in a simulated computer work session and produces improving oils) improve the workplace, to manage negative emotions and can system of the Autonomic Nervous System. HRV analysis is a good marker of this effect. This ANS balance can be explained by a combined action of the Petitgrain and Basil main components. Some of them have sedative effects, which can induce changes on the activity. The final effect be an improvement of the mental and emotional condition by a combination of reducing stress holistic therapy, taking into account the mind, the body and the spirit of the person. Essential oils can connect with our body and help it to find the best way to solve its needs.

In this sense, proper recovery is crucial to ensure a functional adaptation of the athlete in training of recovery from a psychophysiological perspective can provide information about the actual state of the athlete, but require tools and methodologies that allow to monitor the recovery with fast, in real-time and non-invasive in the natural environment of the athlete. In this context, the two main objectives of this thesis are: the usefulness of (SCG) and (PPG) for analysis of 2) Propose the psychophysiological monitoring of the stress and recovery process as a tool of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) in sport situations, from the combined analysis of HRV and cognitive and behavioural indicators. In Doctoral six three related with innovation methodology for analysis of HRV, and three more related with the application of the analysis of HRV in the sport context. In the first part of the thesis, we propose techniques SCG and PPG RR intervals and subsequent analysis of HRV. In the case of the use of the SCG, the results show that is necessary a stringent conditions of record in supine position, total rest and the importance to customize the placement of the device on the sternum of the person to improve the quality signal. SCG of iPhone an effective technique for remote monitoring of the athlete without additional accessory. In the case of facial PPG, the results show that the supine position is more optimal than the sitting position. Although the registration conditions are too strict as for use in a sport context can be effective in natural contexts of hospital for monitoring patients in a controlled environment. In the second part of the thesis proposes HRV analysis for the determination of specific profiles depending on the sport. This methodology could help to determine the predisposition of the athlete to a sport modality or to evaluate the adaptation of the athlete compared to other colleagues who follow the same training plan. The combined analysis of HRV with the mood in a timely evaluation is useful for detecting states of Vigour or Fatigue, but not enough to detect profiles of Tension, Depression or Hostility. Also proposed the EMA as for detecting psychophysiological profiles of breathing, the results indicate that the protocol used paced in interpretation of the state of stress-recovery assessed with questionnaires. In sense, the results show that spontaneous breathing provides relevant information about the of stress the athlete. From the results obtained in this thesis, we propose the use to analyse HRV, mood and behavioural aspects relating to the recovery or lifestyles, according to a model of EMA and to a non-invasive technology thanks to the integrated sensors themselves.
