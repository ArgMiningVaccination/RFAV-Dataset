The team confirmed that the seeds of both plants contain around 40% oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids. The results of the study were published in the Journal of Oleo Science. Plant oils consist of triglycerides (molecules that contain three acid residues), and the value of any type of oil for nutrition, medicine, and other applications is determined by the type of fatty acid residues have anti-tumor properties and help combat obesity, inflammations, and diabetes. An international team of chemists from RUDN University was the first to identify the fatty acid residue content in the seeds of T. nudiflora and T. two plants from the genus of tubergourd (Thladiantha). Tubergourds are common in Southeast Asia and are often used as medicinal plants in traditional Chinese the most important components plant oils. Knowing the quantitative and qualitative parameters of seed oil fats, one can understand the so-called fatty acid composition of the oil that shows whether it is beneficial for human health. This information can be used to identify counterfeit oils,\" said Prof. Olga Kovalchukova, a PhD in Chemistry from the Department of General Chemistry at RUDN University. The team used spectral and chromatographic methods to study the oils and green technique to separate their components. A 1:3:17 mixture of fats, urea, and ethanol was kept in the freezer at --20? for 12 hours and then filtered. This way the team eliminated saturated fats from the oils. Based on the study the extract, the that valuable oils amounted to 40.3% dubia and T. nudiflora, respectively. residues volume of punicic acid amounted to 35.6% mole fractions in the T. dubia oil and 27% mole fractions in the T. nudiflora. 6%, respectively. interesting discovery was alpha-elaeosteraic acid with 28% content in the nudiflora oil. Its molecule contains three conjugated double bonds which make it toxic for some types of cancer. \"We were the first to analyze the quantitative be in the products of seed oil saponification by using urea crystals at --20?. This is a method that helps preserve all valuable unsaturated fatty acids,\" added Prof. Olga Kovalchukova. ### Journal Journal of Oleo Science "}
