Stages in new drug development Drug discovery phase - Synthesis and isolation of compound - New chemical entity (NCE) - Takes 1-2 years Preclinical studies - 2-4 years Investigational New Drug Application (IND) - Submission & review by FDA - 3-6 months 3. IND Clinical Trials Phase 1 Phase 3 Pre clinical studies continued Plus Long term animal toxicity Product formulation Manufacturing & controls Package & label designs New Drug Application (NDA) Review & grant of marketing permission 0.5 to 2 years Post marketing surveillance (Phase -4) Stages in new drug development 5. Approaches to drug discovery Random screening - Natural sources - Chemical Synthesis Serendipity Rational drug designing - approach centered Designing a prodrug or active metabolite as a (1961) Furosemide(1962) 9. Drug Discovery by Serendipity Happy observation by chance New use of old drugs or its side effects find new therapeutic application target - Depends sound knowledge & identification of specific target for action on isolated organs Tests on bacterial cultures Tests on animal models of human diseases - Diabetic rats / dogs by diazoxide - for anti-epileptic drugs General observational tests on intact animals 17. Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Embodies a set of principles that provides a framework of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) laid down by International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 19. Investigational New Drug (IND) IND license (DCGI) - USA: FDA Drug Practice (GCP) GCP include of human a subject in clinical trial. - Provides assurance of the safety and efficacy the newly developed compounds. Good Clinical clinical trials should be conducted, - define the trial - Exposure to numbers of human subjects - Collection of increasing amounts of data on safety and efficacy of the drug I II III IV 23. PHASE I (Early clinical Pharmacology and safety) N = 20 - 80 healthy volunteers (sometimes duration 1 adverse dose ranging) Inclusion and exclusion are fixed N 500 patients Carried out by trained physicians Duration: 2-3 years Type: Open label / Blind Venue: 2 - 4 centres Establishment of therapeutic efficacy patients 27. Registration New Drug Application (NDA) along with the Data (safety and efficacy) of Clinical Trials are regarding - Efficacy, tolerability and Adverse effects n = 4000 - 5000 patients more Even drugs / formulations are withdrawn from the market if found to be injurious to in Western countries & for pediatric group in India Aspirin liquid formation: due to possibilities of producing Reye's Syndrome in children "}
