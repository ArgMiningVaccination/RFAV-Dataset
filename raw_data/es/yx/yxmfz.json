Bone metastasis is the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor to the bone. Cancer cells cause a cycle in patients' immune response, dendritic cells, in presenting antigens to T lymphocytes, which will move to the tumor and kill cancer cells, releasing new antigens. This cycle is inhibited by factors the tumor environment, so new therapies such immunotherapies are being sought to project, vaccines as which have been used successfully effects. aim the efficiency vaccines against breast cancer cells and their bone metastasis, for which we made nine vaccine preparations from the 4T1 cell line. Parental 4T1 which cells 4T1 cells. All three cell types were lysed or with paraformaldehyde inoculating them However, none of the growth other than the mice that received a placebo. This lack of effect could be due to the low immunogenicity of breast cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment inhibiting the immune response. For this reason, it is to improve the formulation of vaccines or combine vaccination with other therapies before testing their efficiency for the treatment of bone metastasis. [Tesis - "}
