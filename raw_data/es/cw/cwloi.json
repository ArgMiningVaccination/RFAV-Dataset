PhD From the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, Calif. Volume 279(19), 20 May 1998, pp Context: Research both in the United States and abroad suggests that significant numbers of people are involved with forms of alternative medicine. However, the reasons at present, poorly understood Three primary hypotheses were tested. People seek out these alternatives because (1) they are dissatisfied in some way with conventional treatment; (2) they see alternative treatments as offering more personal autonomy and control over health care decisions; and (3) the alternatives are seen as more compatible with the patients' values, worldview, or beliefs regarding the nature and meaning health and illness. Additional predictor variables explored included demographics and health status.

Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine did not predict use of medicine. Only 4.4% of therapies and NHS In the early 20th century, scientific medicine emerged as the dominant model for health care in the West. Yet, despite the successes of scientific medicine, people have continued to seek treatments outside mainstream services.1 In the United Kingdom about one in 10 of the adult population consults a CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) practitioner every year, and 90% of this contact happens outside the NHS.2 Why do people turn to these Persistent symptoms the real or the fragmenting lens of clinical specialisation or within the time pressured popularity of a be confused its CAM may simply reflect the limitations of conventional treatments.

These researchers estimated that Americans made 425 million visits to alternative health care providers in 1990, a Figure that exceeded to allopathic primary care physicians during the same period. At present, there is no clear or comprehensive theoretical model to account for the increasing use of alternative forms of health care. Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to develop some tentative explanatory models that might M.A. more poorer health status a holistic orientation to health having had a transformational experience that changed person's their to environmentalism, commitment to psychology Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine did not predict use of medicine. Only 4.4% of those surveyed reported relying primarily on with educated and reporting poorer health status, the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine but largely because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations [1] reported that used at least 1 unconventional form of health care (defined as those practices \"neither taught widely in U.S. medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals\") during the previous year.

Although educated, middle-class white persons between the ages of 25 and 49 years were the most likely ones to use alternative medicine, use was not confined to any particular segment of the population. Recent studies in the United States [2] and abroad [3,4] support the prevalent use of alternative health care. For example, a 1994 survey of physicians from a wide array of medical specialties (in Washington State, New Mexico, and Israel) revealed that more than 60% recommended alternative therapies to their patients at least once in the preceding year, while 38% had done so in the while 23% incorporated them into their practices.

What possessed him? He was motivated by the writings of poets who extolled the pock-free complexions of milkmaids by a this bold experiment ushered in the vaccine era, which is today's foundation for public health vaccinations and inoculations world-wide. Virtually all of conventional and integrative medicine has evolved out of such clinical practice over time and is accepted as a standard of practice or discarded based on perceived efficacy.1 Such case studies forming the tort precedents in the practice of law. All clinical care involves adapting general guidelines, research findings and procedures to one particular individual, with a specific condition at one point in time. This constitutes the 'art' of medicine. Such a standard virtually always report better patient outcomes than is documented in the research literature. Is this self-deception or testimony to the elegant accuracy of clinical alternative or integrative medicine? At the root of this debate is a ubiquitous assertion that conventional medicine is grounded in evidence-based research integrative medicine is not. That assertion is grossly inaccurate and this brief article assertion while challenging both conventional and medicine to a higher standard. To provide a baseline against which to measure complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), it is important to point out that as much as 20-50% of conventional care, and virtually all surgery, has not been evaluated by RCTs. According to Richard Smith, editor of the British Medical Journal, 'Only about 15% of medical interventions are supported by solid scientific evidence... This is partly because only 1% of the articles in medical journals are scientifically sound and partly because many treatments have never been assessed at all'.2 In 1998, James Dalen, Dean of the University of Arizona and editor of Archives of Internal Medicine focused on the evidence basis for cardiology which is often cited as one of the more empirical medical specialities. According to Dalen, in 1986 the American College of Chest Physicians rated the evidence base of positive results) to 'C' (non-randomised, no series). of the therapies rated 'A' while 45% rated 'C'.3 When this was in 1998, 44% were rated as 'A'. Most recently, Brian Berman, coordinator of the Cochrane CAM reviews at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, took a random subset of 159 out of 326 completed Cochrane reviews of conventional medicine only.4 These 20.8% to treatment was more harmful category of 'Evidence of Negative Effect': that figure stands at 6.9%, which represents common medical procedures that are known to have a negative effect and yet remain in common usage. To place that 6.9% in perspective, an article in JAMA in 1994 posited a minimum 'error rate' in medicine of 1%.5 article, author quotes the prominent business scholar W E Deming, who stated: 'If we had to live with about 99.9% (error rate), we would have two unsafe plane landings at O'Hare every day; pieces of mail lost every hour, and bank checks from the wrong Surely, error rate is alarming 6.9% is intolerable. In addition, a frequently cited report from 1978 by the Office of Technology Assessment found that only an estimated 10-20% of quipped, 'Be open minded, but not so open minded that your brains fall out.' There is probably no other area of research that generates such an acrimonious debate than between advocates versus critics integrative medicine practices. the following findings (based on a January 2002 Medline Search) with regard to conventional medical practice and the percentage percentage): General medicine in a UK District General Hospital at 53% vs. 29%6 General medical 'suburban' practice in the UK at 30% vs. 51%7 Acute adult psychiatry at 65% vs. no data on non-experimental evidence8 General psychiatry in the UK at 53% vs. 10%9 General medicine in Japan at 21% vs. 60%10 Regional paediatric surgery in the UK at 11% vs. 66%11 Surgical/vascular unit in a UK teaching hospital at 24% vs. 71%12 Haematology at a Danish university hospital at 38% vs. 33%15 Internal medicine in Canada at 20.9% vs. no non-experimental estimate16 Eleven general hospitals in France at 50% vs. 28%17 Cancer centre in the USA at 24% vs. 21%18 Anaesthesia in Australia at 32% vs. 64.7%19 Twelve community the UK at 39.9% vs. 7%20 Tertiary cancer surgical centre in the USA at 14% vs. 64%21 General medical care at 34 primary care clinics in Spain at 38% vs. 4%22 Internal medicine in a Swedish teaching hospital at 50% versus 34%.23 Again, the focus here is upon conventional medicine only since advocates of an evidence-based approach consistently cite conventional practice as the gold standard. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate to gauge the standard that is clearly found to be grossly deficient in a rigorous evidence base. Bear in mind that these studies and resulting statistics are compounded in their assertion by fact percentages, or those practices that continue despite no evidence or actual evidence of harm, ranges from a low of 3% in a tertiary, paediatric surgical unit14 to an alarming 58% not supported in the study of 34 primary medical care clinics in Spain.22 One review cited many of these same studies but drew the opposite conclusion that, 'claims that conventional is in 'self evident interventions' or non-experimental percentages in are presumptuous at best and erroneously reinforce a double standard that fails the fundamental definition evidence-based medicine. In contrast, insisting equally rigorous evidence-based standards, many alternative medicine actually have a stronger evidence base than many practices:1 in nautical terms, let all boats rise with the tide. This is not to diminish the necessity of rigorous standards in integrative medicine but to urge both conventional and integrative medicine raise accepted of evidence-based medicine is offered by Sackett, as the 'Integration of individual clinical expertise by evidence'.25 This is a delicate and complex balance but is increasingly necessary. As but one instance in conventional medicine, commonly used heart medication for over 200 years! Advocates support use to treat congestive heart failure (CHF), critics argue that should be curtailed. After a 200-year scientific and clinical debate, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study of over 7000 patients using Digitalis.26 Although Digitalis did reduce CHF hospitalisations by reduce CHF death and more patients taking Digitalis died of lethal heart arrhythmias. This study by Milton Packer of the Columbia Medical School may finally relegate articles is the rigor of Cochrane reviews which evidence suggests have, Alejandro R Jadad and colleagues in a Journal of the American Medical Association article of One frequent misconception of Cochrane reviews is that a include data and non-experimental case studies. There is in the contribution of such qualitative research findings to the health and medical care evidence base. Qualitative research is concerned with the subjective emotional and experiential phenomena in to determine what, how and why such factors influence both health and reviewers need to consider how incorporate them. There is potential for findings from qualitative research enhance both the quality and relevance of systematic reviews and their applications practice and research. When framing questions, such findings can help to define the and contribute to the choice of outcome Qualitative research may also generate data on the subjective experience of an intervention to be included in a systematic review on basis patients, practitioners and procedures are complex, interactive, dynamic systems with other even larger and more complex ethical, philosophical, economic, and spiritual dimensions. It is well beyond the scope of this article to describe the specifics of advanced biostatistical techniques in quantitative research. However, the applications of advanced of biostatistical data analysis does enable investigators to evaluate a CAM system as an integrated whole within its own context. According to Iris R Bell and her colleagues at the University of Arizona School of Medicine, 'Path analysis (an extension of multiple regression), structural equation modelling (analysis that includes latent variables), and confirmatory factor analysis (a systematic analysis of the pattern of relationships among variables that a examples this type of healthcare outcomes research. These techniques allow us to look at the complex relationships among many dependent and independent variables at the same time, consistent with the higher level of organisation in a complex systems theory model.'28 By specifying paths by which specific variables affect others, then it becomes possible to demonstrate more explicit inferences. Through all medicine should be judged will be raised for the benefit of both patients and practitioners. References Pelletier KR. The Best Alternative Medicine: What Works? What Does Not?

Writing about my patients' stories has been an instrument of healing for such as reflective being taught in more and more medical schools.[19] Students can improve capacity which suggest that empathy is indeed hard to teach, and may in fact be lost during medical training, it is through narrative, perhaps, that what has been lost can be discovered or regained Sloan and marriage is associated with lower mortality. 1.8 Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is a title used to refer to a diverse group of health-related therapies and disciplines which are not considered to be a part of mainstream medical care. Other terms sometimes used and hence we have adopted it on our Report. CAM embraces those therapies that may either be provided along side conventional medicine (complementary) or which may, in the view of their practitioners, act as a substitute for it. Alternative disciplines effective Estimates of cost per quality adjusted life year of acupuncture for headache and of spinal manipulation for back pain compare well with other treatments approved for Canter and colleagues performed a systematic review and assessed cost effectiveness reported in one acupuncture trial and four trials of spinal manipulation. Despite the favourable clinical trial. They often erroneously believe that they can do no harm. 7-11% of the UK population have consulted a complementary practitioner over the past year. Whilst it is important to be open minded, any treatment, intervention or medication traditional or alternative, bought over the or prescribed by a health professional) should be considered with a healthy degree of scepticism. Complementary or Alternative Medicine (often referred to as CAM) should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being (including improved control of headache and migraine). CAM practitioners take a holistic view of health (i.e. viewing the whole person not just a particular part of them as often happens in mainstream medicine) taking into account all symptoms, individual preferences, lifestyle and family history; they will spend a long time during the first consultation asking many different questions which you may feel are totally unrelated to your migraine. Complementary techniques are those that lack definitive proof of efficacy and are not accepted by the medical mainstream. While many treatments widely used in modern medicine also lack scientific proof, they are not considered complementary or alternative because of their wide acceptance by the medical establishment. Eisenberg, et al. NEJM 1993; 328: 1990 national telephone survey 1/3 of patients use alternative methods 72% of users of the American population uses some form of CAM, with 39% of the older population using CAM. A more recent study (Williamson et an even national average. Of the older adults who use CAM, 58% reported that they did not discuss the use of CAM with their medical doctor or health care practitioner (Astin, 1998). In this issue is a report of an interesting study involving a comparison of acupuncture with pharmacologic prophylaxis for suppression of headache. Future issues reports and invited feature articles related to CAM. For those who have a particular interest in this area, please note that our Society offers a special interest section for CAM (chair, Alexander Mauskop; secretary, Marc Husid) and that the National Institutes of Health has added a center for CAM with its own research budget to match. Headache: The Journal of Head and Face Pain Volume 42 Issue 9 Page 843 - October 2002 The CAM Section was formed with the following goals and exchange information among section members, (2) to evaluate the scientific evidence regarding the risks and benefits of different CAM modalities, (3) to support and coordinate research into CAM treatments for headaches, (4) to educate AHS members about the use of CAM for headaches, and (5) to educate headache sufferers through the American Council on Headache Education and through Complementary and alternative practices can be grouped under the categories Gong or magnet application). Individual examples are too numerous to mention. The CAM Section will position as research priorities those therapies that possess a plausible scientific basis for efficacy, along with therapies and supplements that widely of a seeking to evaluate utility the prophylactic therapy of migraine. Over the past decade, we have learned much regarding the effects of magnesium on brain neurotransmitters, and metabolism. modulated in magnesium concentration, and the release of regulated aggregation. several hypotheses of migraine pathogenesis that have been proposed over the years, the idea of magnesium deficiency as a risk factor for migraine has produced much skepticism. It is important that we evaluate in a convincing way this simple, safe, and inexpensive therapy. Another group of treatments stem from what may be called alternative medical systems. Acupuncture is a popular alternative therapy; a wealth of animal studies have indicated biological effects, but there have been few Research has identified some of acupuncture's fibers in the muscle that is transmitted through the to the midbrain and pituitary-hypothalamus.

Although we may confident that through basic research we understand important mechanisms of action of this treatment intervention, the challenge of performing a double-blind clinical study to evaluate the efficacy is prodigious. Difficulties of trial design include needle obviously the know it. Needles inserted in the wrong locations still produce an effect greater than placebo. We believe that we must do more to assess this important treatment, which is not costly and produces almost no side effects while was initially thought to be available. For a therapy that healthy volunteers and in patients other CAM evaluation. Many do not lend themselves scientific research, and the task of developing innovative protocols will be an exciting and challenging one.

What is the connection between magnesium and headaches? A. Studies find that half headaches don't have enough magnesium.

For instance, serotonin, a chemical in the brain called a neurotransmitter, is involved in headaches. And serotonin success process. also has of migraine. study involved 55 patients who received a daily intake of 400 mg of riboflavin or placebo for Fifty-nine receiving (p _ 0.002). Furthermore, riboflavin was found to to in reducing attack frequency (p _ the riboflavin for at least 3 months. The authors concluded that additional research is warranted. Q. How about riboflavin and feverfew? A. Riboflavin is vitamin B2, which has long been suspected to help migraines. In one double blind trial conducted in Belgium, participants headaches improved from an average of four headaches a month to two a month after three months of taking daily 400 mg of riboflavin. (11) I do not recommend this high a dose for pregnant women. In another study, 72 volunteers received either feverfew or a placebo. Those receiving the found the severity and frequency of their migraines reduced.

Biofeedback refers to any procedure that provides information about physiologic processes, usually through the use of electronic instrumentation, in the form of an observable display,typically an audio tone or visual display. The patient uses feedback about a particular physiologic function self-regulate the response being monitored.8 Thermal (hand-warming) feedback (feedback of skin temperature used most frequently in treating migraine, typically in activity from muscles of the scalp or neck, or from training described above). As with training, patients are instructed the self-regulation skills they are learning during biofeedback training for about 20 to 30 minutes a day and, as they master self-regulation skills, to integrate these FEEDBACK El bio-feedback es una t\u00e9cnica que, mediante la utilizaci\u00f3n de aparatolog\u00eda especializada, el paciente puede aprender a controlar su dolor. Con estos instrumentos el enfermo es capaz de percibir algunas de sus funciones org\u00e1nicas; por ejemplo: el grado de contracturas musculares, la temperatura de su piel, el estado de sus arterias cerebrales, etc. Estas funciones le son exhibidas en forma de sonidos o im\u00e1genes en pantallas de televisi\u00f3n. En otras palabras, \u00e9l escucha o puede visualizar el grado de contracci\u00f3n de sus m\u00fasculos o el di\u00e1metro de sus arterias.

A review recently completed by the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and (Yucha & Gilbert, 2004) determined women. And what about biofeedback? A. While there are several types of biofeedback, the two that seem to work best and are well validated temperature biofeedback. 17. Chapman, S.L. (1986) A review and clinical perspective on the use EMG biofeedback is used to help patients learn to better control their muscular tension, because muscular involvement is often an important contributor people learn when their muscles are reacting and how to reduce that muscular tension. We usually focus on the head and neck muscles. Temperature biofeedback is based on more anxious and uptight, your fingertip temperature falls. The vessels in the fingertips are responsive to the sympathetic nervous system activation. So the more aroused you get, the cooler your hands get. We put a temperature biofeedback device on the fingertips and teach people through the feedback they get that if they can learn to warm their hands, they can learn how to reduce that level of arousal and relax. Q. How long does it take to learn this? A. With biofeedback, some people are just naturals at it. They're almost like star athletes and they have it right away. For most, it takes eight to 12 sessions to learn biofeedback. But once you've got the skills, it's like learning to ride a bike. It tends to stay with you and you don't need a lot of additional workups or booster sessions to keep your skills sharp. It's the same relaxation the body Biofeedback device gives us a window into the body to see the changes Quickens the learning Remember, if people become anxious during a particular exercise they can always open their eyes or stop participating Dr Claudio Mart\u00ednez G [ 38 ](//slideplayer.es/slide/2747346/10/images/38/Terapia+cognitivo-conductual.jpg) Terapia cognitivo-conductual Identificaci\u00f3n de gatillos y/o factores que desencadenan o exacerban el estr\u00e9s.

Acupuncture and sham acupuncture were administered by specialized physicians and consisted of 12 sessions per patient over 8 weeks. The sham treatment consisted of needles Patients completed headache diaries from 4 weeks before to 12 weeks after randomization and from week 21 to 24 after randomization. The researchers found that between baseline and weeks 9 to 12, the average number of days with headache of moderate or severe intensity decreased by 2.2 days from a baseline of 5.2 days in the acupuncture group compared with a decrease to 2.2 days from a baseline of 5.0 days in the sham acupuncture group, and by 0.8 days from a baseline of 5.4 days in the waiting list group. No difference was detected between the acupuncture and the sham acupuncture groups while there was a difference between the acupuncture group compared with the waiting list group (1.4 days). The proportion of responders (reduction in headache days by at least 50 percent) was 51 percent in the acupuncture group, 53 percent in the sham acupuncture group, and 15 percent in the waiting list group. \"In conclusion, in our trial, acupuncture was associated with a reduction of migraine headaches compared with no treatment; were similar to those observed with sham acupuncture and may be due to nonspecific physiological effects of needling, to a powerful combination of both,\" the authors write. ### (JAMA. researchers 302 The participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: True acupuncture. Twelve 30-minute sessions over a period of eight weeks. Needles were placed at defined acupuncture points. Sham acupuncture. Twelve 30-minute sessions over a period of eight weeks. Needles were placed in at least five out of ten predefined non-acupuncture sites. Waiting list control group. Twelve weeks of no treatment, followed by true acupuncture as described above. Practitioners who were trained and experienced in acupuncture administered both the true and sham acupuncture. Although the whether patients did not. All patients maintained a headache diary from four weeks before the start of treatment, through 12 weeks after the start of treatment, and then at weeks after the start of treatment. They noted all migraine attacks and Findings Between the four weeks preceding the start of treatment and weeks nine to 12 after the start of treatment, the number of days with a migraine of moderate to severe intensity decreased by an average of 2.2 days in both the true acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups. On the other hand, patients in the waiting list control group experienced a decrease in moderate to severe migraines of only 0.8 days (from a baseline of 5.4 days) during the same time period. This differed significantly from both the true and sham acupuncture groups. They found that 51% of true acupuncture patients and 53% of sham acupuncture patients were responders, compared to only 15% of patients in the waiting list group. Patients receiving true acupuncture were also significantly less likely than patients in the waiting list group to need medication, experience other symptoms associated with migraines, or have their activities impaired by migraines. There were no significant differences between the true and sham acupuncture groups in these areas. None of the patients receiving true or sham acupuncture reported any serious adverse effects. This study is limited by fact were primarily recruited through newspaper advertisements, attitude towards acupuncture than the average migraine sufferer. Affect You? This study found no significant differences between true and sham acupuncture significantly more beneficial than no treatment at all. But if true acupuncture fared no better than sham acupuncture, then why speculate although their sham acupuncture was designed not and sham may have a powerful placebo effect. In is swallowing pill. But acupuncture, even the sham acupuncture patient is interacting frequently with a practitioner, and is experiencing the ritual associated with acupuncture. As a result, the benefit of the overall experience, if not the acupuncture itself, may be profound enough to have a clinically important impact. While true acupuncture was no more effective than sham acupuncture in this study, this form of therapy does appear to have some benefit. And, unlike with medications, the risk of adverse effects is minimal. If you decide to try acupuncture, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine recommends the following: Ask your primary health care provider if he or she can recommend a practitioner. Find out about the practitioner's license and credentials, and where they received their training. Ask you insurer whether they will cover the cost of therapy. Also, when you meet with the acupuncturist, be sure to discuss his or her treatment plan up front. Like many medications, the effectiveness of acupuncture can only be determined after a trial period. A competent acupuncturist will be able to estimate the number of sessions required during this also that you discuss all migraine treatments you are receiving with both your primary care provider and your acupuncturist.
