Knowledge of the methadone-assisted treatment programmes in the country is crucial in order to propose improvement strategies.Methods 13 attending programmes, description services offered, their methadone treatment protocols, the various barriers to of treatment abandonment were reviewed.Results 12/13 questionnaires were analysed with a total of 538 active patients. Most of the patients attending these programmes were men (85.5%) between 18 and years-old (70%). Forty percent heroin use were mental illness (48%), hepatitis C (8.7%) and HIV (2%). Psychiatric comorbidity was more likely in patients attending the a dose from 41 to 80mg/day. Lack of alignment with primary care was perceived to be the most serious barrier to access, ahead of problems with insurance and prejudice (p<0.05). Health Administration and insurance together with lack of availability of methadone (p<0.018) and relapse (p<0.014) were the reasons of treatment protocols programmes offer different levels of development and implementation. Some of the barriers to access and reasons for abandonment of treatment with methadone can be mitigated with better health administration. Colombia est\u00e1 enfrentado una epidemia emergente del consumo endovenoso de hero\u00edna. Un conocimiento de los programas existentes que ofrecen tratamiento asistido con metadona en el pa\u00eds es necesario para que se puedan proponer estrategias de mejor\u00eda.M\u00e9todos Se encuestaron 13 programas de regiones prioritarias. Se evaluaron las caracter\u00edsticas demogr\u00e1ficas y cl\u00ednicas de los usuarios, as\u00ed como los servicios ofrecidos por estos programas, sus protocolos de tratamiento con metadona y las diferencias en las barreras al tratamiento y las causas de abandono del tratamiento.Resultados Se analizaron 12/13 cuestionarios, con un total de 538 pacientes activos. La mayor\u00eda de los pacientes eran varones (85,5%) de 18 a 34 a\u00f1os (70%). El 40% eran usuarios de drogas intravenosas y el 25% admiti\u00f3 compartir agujas. Entre las comorbilidades asociadas con el consumo de hero\u00edna se encontr\u00f3 la enfermedad mental (48%), la hepatitis C (8,7%) y la infecci\u00f3n por el VIH (2%). La comorbilidad psiqui\u00e1trica se asocia m\u00e1s con los pacientes que acuden al sector privado (el 69,8 frente al 29,7%; p<0,03). La media de la dosis inicial de metadona es 25,3\u00b18,9mg/d\u00eda y las dosis de mantenimiento van de 41 a 80mg/d\u00eda. La falta de articulaci\u00f3n con atenci\u00f3n primaria fue una barrera m\u00e1s sentida que los problemas con la cobertura del seguro m\u00e9dico y los prejuicios del tratamiento con metadona (p<0,05).

Heroin use in the Colombian population had a lifetime prevalence of 0.14% (31,852 people) a last year prevalence of 0.03% in 2013. [1](#bib0165) In contrast, in 2015 lifetime over although the authors did not report lifetime or last year data on opioid use in other age groups. [2](#bib0170) The 2013 estimates indicate that there may have been around 7000 heroin users in Colombia in the last year. [1](#bib0165) Although these figures appear small when compared to other countries in the region with higher levels of opiate use, as Bolivia or Chile (0.5%), [3](#bib0175) this growing demand in Colombia may overwhelm the capacity of the available treatment services. In a study conducted in Medell\u00edn in 50 patients with heroin addiction who accessed treatment, it was found that the majority were male (74%) with an average age of 23, having begun using heroin on average at the age of 18. Some 38% also had psychiatric comorbidities, with a risk of HIV infection that was curiously not associated with intravenous use, assess the situation of patients who do not access treatment services in Colombia, a further study was conducted using the The users (IVDUs) is 3.8% in the city of Medell\u00edn and 1.9% in the city of Pereira. [7,8](#bib0195) Although these prevalences the 7.4% reported for Latin America and the Caribbean, [9](#bib0205) the risk of an HIV infection and the risks thereof includes legislation (Law 1566 of 2012) guaranteeing comprehensive care to those who use psychoactive substances, and the Pol\u00edtica Nacional para la Reducci\u00f3n del Consumo de Sustancias Psicoactivas y su Impacto [Colombian National Policy for the Reduction of the Use of Substances and their Impact], [10](#bib0210) which defines the sector-specific approaches to this issue, and which is implemented in the form of the Plan Nacional de Respuesta al Consumo Emergente de Hero\u00edna [Colombian National Plan in Response to Emerging Heroin Use], [11](#bib0215) on health together ensure of heroin and other opiates are covered under the Plan Obligatorio de Salud (POS) [Colombian Compulsory Health Plan]. [13](#bib0225) The general approaches of the various methadone-assisted centres have been established in the regions with the highest prevalences of this issue, although they may be at different stages of development and implementation as the details of their current status are unknown. These programmes have been using methadone in tablet form only, as liquid methadone is not available in Colombia. The use of methadone with digital administration systems of during in countries where it is available. The central objectives of this study were to describe the status of the programmes in these regions that are using MAT, to identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of the users of services and the programmes' characteristics, to identify the patterns of use and used and to potential barriers to access and causes of treatment abandonment. An additional objective of this study was to describe the significant differences between public and of users, programmes and barriers to treatment might us areas that improvement were from the seven Colombian regions and cities where heroin use is most concerning (Antioquia, Bogot\u00e1, Cauca, Norte de Santander, Quind\u00edo, Risaralda and Valle del Cauca). All programmes in these locations that had reported MAT for the services in the United States, [14](#bib0230) which was adjusted based on a literature review [15-17](#bib0235) and adapted to the country's needs with feedback from experts with knowledge of treatment centres in Colombia. The instrument comprises five barriers to access and causes of treatment abandonment; (d) treatment models and medications used; and (e) was consensually reviewed by three national experts, then emailed to the 13 different programmes providing MAT for opioid use disorder (heroin and opiate addiction). The SPSS statistics program (IBM SPSS Statistics 22) was used for the descriptive analysis of all the programmes and the differences between public programmes (n=7) and private programmes (n=5). Student's t-test was used for the differences between the averages of continuous variables, while Pearson's 2 test was used for the differences between the proportions of categorical variables. Differences in the amplitude of barriers to access and causes of treatment abandonment were analysed using a scale from 0 (never occurs) to 5 (always present), using ANOVA and post hoc analysis to assess the differences between each barrier or reason. Statistical significance defined two-tailed tests and p value Twelve questionnaires out of the to the the the the programmes, with descriptions of the patients on active treatment and the services provided by the programmes, as well as the relevant differences between public other supportive sources. The total number of patients on active MAT was 536. Some 85.6% of these patients on treatment were male, of under 17s was significantly more represented in the private sector than in the public sector (25% vs. 7%; p<0.04) and more likely to be students, although was not significant had suffered a heroin overdose, the majority in the private sector (40% vs. 6.7%; p<0.02). Regarding use of other substances, 39% of patients concomitant use of alcohol and of benzodiazepines, substances that increase the risk more prevalent problem among of private sector services (20% vs. 3.3%), this difference is not significant. Other conditions associated with heroin addiction include mental illness (48%), hepatitis (8.7%), (2%) and tuberculosis (2.4%). Psychiatric comorbidity is significantly more associated with patients with opiate addiction who use private sector services (69.8% vs. 29.7%; characteristics The treatment programmes are origin 68% Health Promotion Companies from individual patients was anticipated, private obtain of their from public regime, and in turn are more heavily represented in the public sector (82% vs. 39.7%; p<0.04). The treatment methods offered to (91.7%). The treatment programmes generally have practitioner; 50% include a nutritionist qualified operator; 33.3% have a toxicologist and rehabilitation educator; and 25% physician and a majority of these teams (>75%) screen for both substance use and its associated problems and mental illness, determine the presence of drugs in urine (83.3%) and perform blood tests for hepatitis B (66.7%), hepatitis C (58.3%) and HIV (75%) as well as testing for tubercle bacilli in sputum (75%). Only two (16.7%) of these actively seek out patients in as well as assessing alcohol use using breathalyser one of the treatment programmes (8.3%) offers vaccination against hepatitis B, as well as being a reception and treatment centre for patients in the judicial system. The centres use the methadone treatment guidelines developed by the Centro de Atenci\u00f3n y Rehabilitaci\u00f3n Integral en Salud Mental [Centre for Comprehensive Care and Rehabilitation in Mental Health] (CARISMA) [18](#bib0250) or the WHO [19](#bib0255) as a reference. As matters currently stand, the treatment centres have achieve or are not interested in The total number of patients on active MAT was 536 with a mean of 44.7\u00b160.9 (range 0-199) active patients. As increased by an average of 7.9\u00b14.1mg every 6.5\u00b13 days up to an average dose of 45.9mg/day (range 20-80) of methadone in the first week; nine programmes (75%) said they used maintenance doses in the 41-80mg/day range, while two programmes used maintenance doses at <40mg/day and one programme at average maximum daily (range 40-180). Two of that, per they always induced methadone treatment with the patient hospitalised, before continuing it an outpatient basis. The number of days required before the patient is able to take methadone at home without supervision by medical staff is (range 1-90). Public programmes perform every three to barriers to accessing MAT, using a scale from 0 (never) to 5 (always). The results of the post hoc analysis reveal that lack of coordination with primary care is significantly the greatest obstacle to accessing MAT, a mean of 3.54\u00b10.3 on this assessment scale compared lack of clarity regarding the route of access (2.92\u00b10.3) came second to lack of coordination with primary care, this was not statistically programmes identified prevalent circumstance acting as a to causes of MAT abandonment, using the same scale from 0 (never) to 5 (always). The results of the post hoc analysis suggest that lack of methadone supply is a significantly more common cause of treatment abandonment, with a mean of 2.70\u00b10.5 (p<0.018), together home the methadone or copay p=0.8) are not ( [Fig. The between public and private programmes for barriers to treatment and treatment abandonment are not presented as they were not significant. This study's findings suggest that in general the Colombian MAT programmes analysed have unequal development and implementation of national and international protocols. Among the twelve programmes assessed, some are in the early phases of this implementation, while others are much more developed. For example, one programme reported 150 new patients with opioid addiction in the last year, but only had five patients on MAT. It appears this imbalance could be explained by the fact that the only therapeutic target accepted by this centre is overcoming the addiction, or 100% abstinence from all substances, including This consequence of the restrictions of EPSs, which in this case only cover treatments for overcoming the addiction, not mitigation. Some of the organisations administering healthcare resources and services (EPS and IPS [health service providers]) have their own therapeutic objectives and agendas that do not necessarily match those of the Colombian Health and Social Security System's (SGSSS) policies and plans. The use the of a study conducted in users in the community, which found with 14% sharing intravenous drug paraphernalia. [7,8](#bib0195) The window of opportunity represented by those patients on active treatment who have HIV (2%) or hepatitis C (8.7%) infections is rightly highlighted; it the aim of avoiding the fate of other countries where HIV and hepatitis C rates among intravenous drug have 90%. [22,24-28](#bib0270) Of equal importance in the care of these patients with opiate addiction is the risk of accidental or intentional overdose, which in this study was significantly more common among private sector patients. Some of the programmes studied preferred to start induction of methadone treatment with patient hospitalised, before continuing it on outpatient basis. when inducing methadone treatment. [29](#bib0305) This hospitalisation can be justified only in the event of serious psychiatric comorbidities with suicidal ideation or complex exception are not yet interested in stopping using heroin to make which patients receive methadone daily must achieve a balance between the effectiveness of the MAT and the need to incorporate measures to reduce the risk of accidental overdose or overdose due to interaction with depressants such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. If they are to do this, they must be capable of identifying the people exposed to this risk, warning them of the inherent risk of interaction of these substances with methadone consumption or the use of benzodiazepines. Equally, as not all programmes have the capacity for patients to receive methadone daily at the treatment centre, which is the ideal and the safest option, other alternative means long treatment periods, them ending up on the black market, patients failing to return to treatment centres and a consequent drop in psychosocial interventions. One practical implemented Colombian programmes, which, although not optimal, does offer a degree of safety, is the involvement of an advisor who keeps the methadone and only administers the daily dose indicated by the physician. Another potential alternative to this dilemma is to supply methadone daily from a mobile vehicle that travels around the city and also enables people with transport difficulties to access treatment. In addition to the fact that 50% of all the programmes' users are relatively young, the under 17s and students are turning more to the private sector. The reason for this finding is not clear, but one possible explanation for this significant difference may be an increase in the prevalence of opiate use at these ages among the people who access this sector or, conversely, a barrier to people in these age groups and situations accessing treatment in the public sector as another alternative. With regard to barriers to accessing treatment, lack of coordination with primary care considered to be the problematic barrier. Currently, coordinating with primary care. primary care teams to screen, identify and refer patients with heroin addiction could be one of the actions best able to improve this and consultancy. With time, primary care teams will have the experience to treat stable, low-complexity patients. This is an opportunity for developing and strengthening ties that can be implemented to facilitate access to services and make supervised doses the rule rather than the exception. The second most noted barrier to accessing treatment is the lack of clarity regarding how to access it. Most prevalently, this takes the form of service orders rejected or denied by the EPS, followed by lack of clarity for users regarding coverage of the service. These are some of the most common reasons for patients abandoning treatment. There is therefore a need to train both administrative and clinical staff in the basics of MAT so that the former are not an obstacle and the latter of the barriers to accessing treatment identified\u2014lack of knowledge of the methadone treatment services among the population, community prejudices and those of the medical sustained increased of psychoactive substances and their pharmacological treatments in the schools that problems described above, the lack of availability of methadone in the country is a significant cause of treatment abandonment that must be prevented. Users versa guarantee the permanent availability of any medication used in the treatment of chronic diseases, as is the case, in order to improve treatment, prevent abandonment together increase safe administration during outpatient induction, means to increase access to treatment for opiate addiction. In order to resolve the issue of the permitted be negotiated by the country's representative on the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. Given that this is an emerging cross-sectoral public health issue in Colombia, the national authorities\u2014such as the Ministry of Health, the Treasury, the Ministry of Education and the National Narcotics the addiction that this equipment, well as the inclusion in the SGSSS' national formulary of other medications that could reasonably be a means to confront this emerging public health problem. The Colombian state has made enormous efforts to confront heroin addiction from a harm reduction standpoint. This experience useful and has its strengths and weaknesses, having contributed to stemming not only the costs, more particularly the personal and community costs of pain and decline.Conclusions The increase in the use of heroin in some regions and cities in Colombia is concerning due to the evidence of intravenous use, with the practice of sharing paraphernalia, and an increase in the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis C infections. Data on treatment services highlight the rapid adaptation of existing programmes in mental health and drug addiction to incorporate the use of MAT, which are at different stages of development from the protocols implemented to date. The lack of infrastructure and experience in starting MAT appears to have driven a need for hospitalisation, which will surely change with improvements to the conditions in which MAT is administered. The barriers to access and retention problems addiction. The Colombian experience confronting intravenous heroin use as an emerging disease with a recognised public health impact may serve as a guide for other South American states with higher levels of use.Ethical responsibilitiesProtection of people and animals The authors declare that no experiments were performed on humans or animals for this research.Data confidentiality The authors declare that no patient article.Right to privacy and The declare article.Funding contract no. interest The have no conflicts of interest to declare.
