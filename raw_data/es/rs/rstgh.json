INTRODUCCION-CUESTIONES DE PROCEDIMIENTO 1. Adoption of the Agenda and Timetable 1. Adoption de l'ordre du jour et du calendrier 1. Aprobaci\u00f3n del programa y del calendario Nous passons au point No 1 de notre agenda, \u00e0 savoir l'ordre du jour et le calendrier. L'adoption de l'ordre du jour est trait\u00e9e dans voudrais \u00e9gard l'attention du le point 12.1 est maintenant divis\u00e9 en deux points: 12.1 a) et 12.1 b). Comme cela appara\u00eet d'ailleurs dans le calendrier. Le point Ronald F. R. DEARE (United Kingdom): I would like to say a word or two about the provisional timetable if I may and in particular the proposal to move Item 12 to tomorrow afternoon. My delegation understands the desire of the Council to tackle the very urgent problem that faces us under Item 12. 1 as soon as possible, and we are no less anxious than others to embark on this task but we do believe that there would be much merit in postponing this item until the second week of our deliberations and I say this for two very specific reasons. The first is that it seems to my delegation not logical to move into this major debate without first having an opportunity to examine at least one other very relevant item on our agenda and I refer to Item 12. 2, the Report of the Finance Committee and the Audited Accounts of the Organization which contain very important information which we believe to be relevant to consideration of the Organization's current financial position. So we believe that that debate should pr ecede the debate on Item given to understand that our colleagues from the United States may well be, and very much hope to be, in a position next week to be rather more specific about the financial contribution that they will be able to make to the Organization in the current year and if I may say so, haying the debate this week is a bit like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. So we would very much urge that the Council give consideration to this revision of the timetable. d'abord le point 11 de l'ordre du jour et le point 12. 1 a) la semaine prochaine? Ronald F. R. DEARE (United Kingdom): What I have in mind is that before we discuss Item 12. 1 we should discuss Item 11 which, according to my agenda, are the Reports of the Finance Committee and Item 12. 2 the Audited Accounts, before we discuss Item 12. 1 and my second comment related to the possibility, or the more than a possibility, I hope, that we may have better information in our second week of deliberation about the United States position. I hope that is clear, Mr Chairman. LE DIRECTEUR GENERAL: il convient de dire que le point 12. 1 est le plus important. du rapport (et ceci est des deux sessions du Comit\u00e9 financier avant de commencer le point 12. 1 a). Ceci ne nous emp\u00eachera pas de vous donner pr\u00e9cisions. SHAH (Director, Office of Programme, Budget and Evaluation): Item 12 is intended to begin with the reports of the last two sessions of the Finance Committee, the sessions which were held in May and September of this year, and the two documents which are referred to are CL 90/4 with its corrigendum and CL 90/17. Those two reports would begin the consideration of item 12 with the Chairman of the Finance Committee reporting to the Council on those matters which require Council decision, discussion or merely to be noted for information. It is only following that that it was intended that item 12. 1 (a) would be taken up with the documents CL 90/23 and its two supplements dealing with the issues relating to the Programme of Work and Budget for this biennium and following that with the alternative approaches dealing with uncertainties in the longer term. So I think, as has been clarified by the Director-General, the wishes of the delegate of the United Kingdom are met by the reports of the Finance Committee being considered before we move on to the other documents. LE PRESIDENT: Si j'ai bien compris le Secr\u00e9tariat, on par les rapports des financiers Conseil sur l'ordre du jour et le calendrier? Nous discutons les deux en m\u00eame temps. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): The United States is not able to tell this Council what the economic contribution will be, not because we have a secret but because we do not know, since it depends on the actions of the Congress. That is a very difficult position, very difficult for us and for everybody in this room, not to know what will be the base of the financial picture. We hope to receive direct and clear firm figures during the course of the next week or so and that is about the best we can say. As to in what order these are taken up, whatever the Council feels will be appropriate. We certainly . hope that by some time next week we will have a firm figure, if it is felt that that firm figure is needed for \u00e9t\u00e9 fait la premi\u00e8re semaine. It was so decided Il en est ainsi se acuerda Nous passons alors le point 7.2 \"Election des politiques et programmes d'aide alimentaire: pour d\u00e9cision\". Ce point 7.2 mardi 25 novembre au cours de \u00eatre Conseil, des limite de pr\u00e9sentation des candidatures pour Comit\u00e9 des du Conseil soient de 9 h 30 \u00e0 12 h 30 et de 14 h 30 \u00e0 17 h 30.

I am sure his experience and his attendance at the meetings of the Council will highly benefit the operations. Therefore in the name of my delegation I propose Mr. Alwi Jantan.

INGRAM (WFP): I did not want the Committee to adjourn without the opportunity to express my thanks to the Director-General for his very gracious welcome this morning and for the kind remarks that he made about my reappointment. I will not repeat what I have said in the Committee on Food Aid but I would like to say that I am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to go on working in the service of developing countries and that I shall, of course, continue to do everything I can to discharge that task. Much of what WFP does, much of our work is in the field of agricultural development in support of agriculture and it is indeed essential that in that task WFP and FAO should cooperate; not only strongly committed to close cooperation and working very closely with FAO and its Director-General in the years ahead and I would particularly like to thank Mr Saouma for the statement you made a moment ago for your personal support for me in my work. I do appreciate that and I l ook forward to, as I say, a very close cooperation between our two Organizations. Gerald I. TRANT (WFC): Mr Director-General, Mr Executive Director, Ministers, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Perez de Cuellar has requested me to convey to you his best wishes for a successful session of the FAO Council at a moment when the whole United Nations system is looking into new ways and new means to meet adeguately the enormous challenges which are confronting the international community. -12- In my capacity as Executive Director of the World Food Council I am also grateful to have this opportunity to be introduced to the FAO Council and on the occasion of the opening of this important meeting. Let me assure you I look forward to worki ng not only with the members of the Council but with the Member Countries of the FAO as well. I intend to develop a closer relationship with FAO and I am grateful to the Director-General for having welcomed me in Rome and for having offered his support. As you are all aware the World Food Council has a specific role to play within the United Nations system but we all share common objectives to speed up the solutions to the hunger and malnutrition problem. As head of the Secretariat to the World Food Council I will do my best to work in cooperation with my colleagues in all the United Nations Organizations.

SITUATION MONDIALE DE L'ALIMENTATION-ET DE L'AGRICULTURE II. SITUACION MUNDIAL DE LA AGRICULTURA Y LA ALIMENTACION 4. State of Food and Agriculture 1986 4. Situation de l'alimentation et de l'agriculture en 1986 4. El estado mundial de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n, 1986 . ISLAM (Assistant Director-General, Economie and Social Policy Department): You have before you two documents for discussion on this Agenda Item. The first document, the State of Food and Agriculture CL 90/2, which is based on information available in early August. The second document, CL 90/2 Sup. 1, updates and supplements the earlier document. Both these documents devote some attention to the overall economic environment surrounding agriculture. This is because many of the problems now facing agriculture are closely related to the paradoxes in, and witnesses of, the current economic situation, namely, failure by industrial countries despite lower inflation and interest rates to resume and transmit the momentum of economic growth, disappointing trade performances and low international are costly in terms of human welfare. The current world food s upply situation, while ample at a global level and greatly improved in some critical areas, still presents enormous aspects. Despite a slowdown in world in some developed exporting countries a rate percent per the problem of global over-supply of many agricultural products has not This is because demand remains stocks of relatively high production levels in previous years. As a consequence of both these factors, international prices are low. Agricultural markets have become- fierce competition between export markets through export subsidies and other market incentives. In 1986 growth in f ood production slowed in the developing market economies with the recovery in food production in Africa and acceleration in Latin America, as compared to the performance in the previous year. Food production remained unchanged for output growth in China accelerated. I must point out here a typographical error in Table 1 of the Supplement. The last line of the table refers to \"Total -15- World Food Agriculture the text Table official estimates of USSR cereal production recent years have been released. These serve to increase the original enhanced world estimates shown in Table 1. These changes will be incorporated in the final version of the State of Food and Agriculture now being prepared. Ironically, the continued high rate of'growth in production also served to exacerbate the difficulties in the few agricultural markets as some countries dependence faced problems in their disposal. The case of Africa, which has achieved a cumulative growth of over 8 percent in food production in 1985/86 is a most welcome one. However, this remarkable recovery should not conceal the equilibrium of Africa's food systems is precariously poised. It is both paradoxical and regrettable that at the time countries succeed in improving their production performance, they are deprived of market opportunities that would permit them to benefit from their success. The latest reports of the situation regarding grasshopper infestations in Africa indicate the threat has receded in western and eastern Africa and major food losses have been averted. The danger still exists of desert upsurge Arabian Peninsula and effort. Nevertheless, one year after FAO's of a grasshopper and locust upsurge, the prompt response of African governments be credited as largely successful. The early eighties were a period of serious economic stress for many developing countries. Per hundred in the document. The greatest losses in nutritional levels are found in Africa and Latin America, another third only showed modest gains in per capita calorie intake. Countries Near East achieved calorie consumption but only through increased imports. On the other hand, the improvement in food availability in some Asian countries accounting major all may to changes in income, per capital GDP, food production performance and food imports. The second section of the document CL 90/2 which reveals the agricultural performance of the different regions is complemented by discussion of the emerging issues and problems in each region, particular the faced recent food and agriculture situation in Africa, I should like to mention that in addition to the treatment in this document the subject is also taken up for further discussion in Agenda Item 8. 2. We have in the document a special section on the financing of agricultural development. This is a preview of the special chapter to be published later on in the fuller document on the State of Food and Agriculture. It is not an easy subject to deal with, partly because of the preliminary results of our efforts in this direction for your review and comments with a view to improving the final treatment of the subject to be published later on. How, and from what sources, to mobilise the resources for financing agriculture development and how to use them in rural development is a challenge confronting developing countries. The relative role of domestic finance critical importance, especially in view of the changes which have already occurred and are underway in the economic environment including the availability of external economic assistance to the agricultural sector. The document discusses sources both domestic and external, public and private as well as users of funds for agricultural development. Three major inter-related areas are taken up for analysis. One concerns the financing of agriculture in relation to overall economic development. The emphasis here is on the effective use of limited government resources to relieve the critical constraints on agricultural development, for example on government policy which affects the incentive to save and invest in the agricultural sector; as well as on a coherent fiscal policy for the sector, especially in times of rapid technological change or windfall economic gains. -16- The second main area of focus is on the role of rural financial markets, to mobilise rural savings and to act as an intermediary between savers and investors for investment in rural areas both by agriculture and related activities. The major issues relating to the markets costs and organisation of rural financial institutions, both formal and informal. There are many unsettled questions on each of these over time differ widely. third to of inhibit overall economic develpment, but also development of the agricultural sector. The lack of imported inputs prohibits and frustrates the use to especially in markets for agricultural development. Turning to external sources of finance the issues revolve around the effectiveness of development assistance to agriculture as well as the recent leve lling off of data flows which have an increasingly negative impact on the growth of dispersements later on in the decade. For external key words are dependable can collapse very rapidly. Furthermore, foreign direct investment in the agricultural sector as an answer remains a hotly-debated investment and the agricultural sector but also in atracting external sources. Ahmed Ali MUQBEL language Arabic): I like to preface my remarks by saying how pleased I am to be at this Ninetieth Session of the Council. I should like to extend to ail members of the Council the wishes of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen that we manage to bring this session to a successful also like to commend She role by FAO under the stewardship of Mr Edouard Saouma. On this occasion, we should like to congratulate you and we should like to congratulate all the officers of the Council who have been elected. We are convinced that this Session under your leadership will bear fruit and will lead us to resolutions which will allow us to promote agriculture in developing countries. Please allow me to give you our remarks on this document The State of Food and Agriculture 1986 . My delegation has studied this report very carefully concerned because of the current situation pertaining to agriculture to the economy in and particularly in the low-income developing which are in the and semi-arid regions of the world. Also, the situation is exacerbated by the uncertainties in the NIEO, which is unjust. The Documents show that agriculture somewhat recently, weather cond itions and that drought is going to remain with us for some time. There have also been the problems with locusts and grasshoppers which have infested many regions. On the other hand, many developing countries have to face up to the financial difficulties which have been very bad since the beginning of the 1980s. These have had an adverse effect on agriculture, since this sector has not been able to benefit from the necessary inputs and adequate investment levels. All these factors have constituted a very serious threat to agriculture and to food production. We have to add to this that when developing countries have to turn to outside financial sources so that they can find their way out of these difficult situations they find a world confronted with an economic crisis, with a shrinkage of bilateral aid and with a decrease in the amount of aid provided by regional and international organizations, and at the same time a decrease in Governments' Commitment to Agriculture. This crisis has particularly many African sub-Saharan countries. We should like to praise the African countries the help of donor organizations and donor countries, especially the FAO and the World Food Programme, have been able to face up to the very serious crisis. In other developing countries it would appear that the crisis will continue. So it really depends on the Governments of those countries to find the necessary solutions, i. e. domestic funding, and optimum aid from use of international organizations so that they can find a solution to this crisis. \"Certainly, these countries are going to need more aid to enable them to get out of this deadlock. It is for that reason that aid has to be given from rich countries to poor countries, and there has to be cooperation between them. That is why it is essential to provide the necessary funding to international organizations, particularly the FAO, the World Food Programme and IFAD, because these are the three main institutions that have the n ecessary experience and that are able to develop the agricultural and the rural these solidarity between the developed and the developing world to get out of the crisis and to develop their agricultural sector, and of a better future with peace and stability. -17- It would be futile to talk about peace when we have seen that billions of dollars are being spent on arms while millions of people are dying of hunger. We do not understand why the funds of international organizations such as the FAO should be restricted whilst at the same cime huge sums being on arms and means of descruccion. Therefore the solucion of food problems in the world is linked to a fairer international order which Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Como siempre la declaraci\u00f3n del profesor Islam fue excelente. Nos complace intervenir despu\u00e9s de la exposici\u00f3n que ha hecho nuestro colega de la Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del Yemen porque compartimos algunos de los aspectos de esa declaraci\u00f3n. En cada sesi\u00f3n de este Consejo, en los a\u00f1os pares, el primer temade fondo que se discute siempre es \u00e9ste: \"El estado de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n\". El sentido de las discusiones es siempre el mismo y las conclusiones son siempre las mismas:aumento global de la producci\u00f3n, pero limicada a los escados induscrializados; increraento del comercio, de productos agr\u00edcolas, pero con beneficios s\u00f3lo para los pa\u00edses desarrollados; mayor numero de personas hambriencas y mainucridas, naturalmente en el Tercer Mundo. Las perspectivas son siempre inquietances. Proteccionismo, aumento y diversificaci\u00f3n del proteccionismo, como lo dijo esta ma\u00f1ana con su gran autoridad el Director General, proteccionismo que ahora se nos presenta bajo la nueva condena de los subsidios. Hoy, noviembre de 1986 estamos revisando esa situaci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de las graves crisis en el Africa subsahariana, principalmente en los a\u00f1os 83 a 85. Del 12 al 16 de julio de 1976, este Consejo celebr\u00f3 su 69\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones, excepcional en los a\u00f1os pares, dedicado especialmente a la consideraci\u00f3n de las dos innovaciones m\u00e1s importantes y afortunadas, propuestas por la nueva administraci\u00f3n, que, bajo la direcci\u00f3n del doctor Edouard Saouma, hab\u00eda comenzado en enero de 1976:la descentralizaci\u00f3n, designaci\u00f3n de representantes en los pa\u00edses, funcionarios propios de la FAO y la creaci\u00f3n del Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica;iniciacivas del Director General que han sido ambas muy positivas. El lunes 29 de noviembre 1976 este Consejo, yo era su Presidente Independiente, en el 70\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones estaba analizando esa situaci\u00f3n de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n, despu\u00e9s de la Conferencia Mundial de la Alimentaci\u00f3n celebrada dos a\u00f1os antes y cuando ten\u00edamos la pretensi\u00f3n imaginaria de que hab\u00edamos superado definitivamente la grave crisis alimentaria de principios de los a\u00f1os 70 que afect\u00f3 considerablemente siempre al Africa. Dencro de diez a\u00f1os, el lunes 30 de noviembre 1996, quienes hayamos concado con vida y apoyo pol\u00edcico seguramente escaremos de nuevo en esta sala roja en el 110\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones y el primer tema de fondo ser\u00e1 la sicuaci\u00f3n de la agricultura y la a limencacion, despu\u00e9s de la crisis de principios de los a\u00f1os 90 y en acenci\u00f3n a que va a llegar el a\u00f1o dos mil y la sicuaci\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo ser\u00e1 siempre fr\u00e1gil y preocupance, con millones de es humanos hambriencos y y ocra crisis decenal. Esce recraco escueco que corresponde a la realidad de los hechos confirma el car\u00e1ccer c\u00edclico de las crisis debido indudablemente a la misma forma c\u00edclica y descontinuada como los pa\u00edses desarrollados ofr ecen su asistencia, que alcanza el m\u00e1ximo nivel s\u00f3lo cuando se declaran las crisis y la comunidad internacional denuncia graves hechos de muertos por hambre y malnutricion . Ese cuadro, seg\u00fan la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia, impone una vez m\u00e1s el llamado a los pa\u00edses desarrollados para que no s\u00f3lo en los a\u00f1os de crisis ofrezcan su ayuda alimentaria y financiera, sino que con decidida voluntad pol\u00edtica la asistencia financiera y t\u00e9cnica se suministre continuamente en vol\u00famenes, t\u00e9rminos, condiciones y oportunidades que hagan realmente eficaz la cooperaci\u00f3n incerna-cional y permican a los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo, progresivamence, sencar las bases sobre las cuales pueda lograrse el aumento de su propia producci\u00f3n. -18- La dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n alimentaria y agr\u00edcola por la que atraviesa el Tercer Mundo y la inquietud que se manifiesta en muchos lugares deber\u00edan encuadrarse en el ofrecimiento de esa cooperaci\u00f3n por parte de los pa\u00edses desarrollados, en la frase reciente del honorable Bettino Craxi, Primer Ministro del Gobierno de Italia, quien dijo:\"La asistencia a Los pa\u00edses en desarrollo no es solamente un acto humanitario, sino una necesidad para lograr el equ ilibrio econ\u00f3mico y la paz mundial. \" Una primera hojeada al documento An\u00e1lisis Mundial, la coyuntura econ\u00f3mica, demuestra, como lo dijo el Director General esta ma\u00f1ana, que el proteccionismo sigue siendo el mal tremendo de nuestra \u00e9poca, incorregible. En efecto, los p\u00e1rrafos 1, 3 y 12 se refieren a la constante extensi\u00f3n del proteccionismo comercial, a la necesidad de que los principales pa\u00edses importadores frenen las medidas proteccionistas y a que \"la escasez de divisas y las medidas de ajuste de los pa\u00edses endeudados se deben a la introducci\u00f3n o intensificaci\u00f3n de medidas proteccionistas\". Siempre que va a celebrarse una reuni\u00f3n de importancia renace cierta esperanza, aunque despu\u00e9s esa esperanza desaparezca entre el espejismo y la ingenuidad \u00f3ptica. Ese fue el caso de la Conferencia Ministerial del GATT, realizada a mediados de septiembre pasado en Punta del Este, Uruguay. Colombia tuvo el honor de asociarse con un importante pa\u00eds desarrollado, como Suiza, y juntos llevaron a esa Conferencia un plan que estaba dirigido en el campo agr\u00edcola a eliminar gradualmente los funestos subsidios que particularmente la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea aplica a la producci\u00f3n y exportaci\u00f3n de productos agropecuarios, con graves perjuicios para ios pa\u00edses exportadores del Tercer Mundo y muy altos costos para las poblaciones consumidoras de ios propios Estados de la C. E. E. La propuesta suizo-colombiana fue llamada \"Caf\u00e9 con Leche\" en referencia al excelente caf\u00e9 de Colombia y a la deliciosa leche producida por Suiza. Ten\u00edamos la ilusi\u00f3n de que esa combinaci\u00f3n de esfuerzos provenientes de dos pa\u00edses con niveles de desarrollo diferentes pudieran comenzar a cambiar esa lamentable situaci\u00f3n de ios subsidios; pero la oposici\u00f3n de varios miembros de la C. E. E., apegados a su pol\u00edtica agr\u00edcola com\u00fan, no hizo posible lograr ning\u00fan avance hacia el cambio que es indispensable porque sus consecuencias est\u00e1n afectando gravemente la econom\u00eda de numerosos pa\u00edses en desarrollo. En efecto, el p\u00e1rrafo 13 dice que \"Am\u00e9rica Latina experiment\u00f3 una disminuci\u00f3n del 1. 2 por ciento en el volumen de sus exportaciones y un fuerte deterioro del 3 por ciento en su relaci\u00f3n de inter cambio en 1985. El p\u00e1rrafo 38 indica la causa principal de esa desafortunada situaci\u00f3n:\"Los subsidios a las exportaciones han proliferado y se han acentuado\". Exactamente un mes despu\u00e9s de haberse iniciado la Conferencia del GATT, en Uruguay, el 16 de octubre, D\u00eda Mundial de la Alimentaci\u00f3n, el se\u00f1or Pandolfi, Ministro de Agricultura de Italia y miembro prominente de la CEE, en este mismo edificio, dos pisos m\u00e1s arriba, dijo textualmente:\"Hoy hay m\u00e1s barreras comerciales en la agricultura que en 1973, antes de la ronda de Tokio. Grandes cantidades de productos agr\u00edcolas\u00b7son vendidas en ios mercados mundiales a precios inferiores a los practicados en el mercado interior. Todos estamos llamados a cumplir un esfuerzo de prudencia, de equilibrio y coraje\", concluy\u00f3 el Ministro italiano Pandolfi. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia espera que esa manifestaci\u00f3n honesta sea un buen principio de rectificaci\u00f3n en la pol\u00edtica de la CEE, a cuyos doce Estados el gobierno colombiano reitera su admiraci\u00f3n y simpat\u00eda. Pedimos que este Consejo reitere, una vez m\u00e1s, su llamado a la CEE y a los dem\u00e1s pa\u00edses industrializados que practican el proteccionismo para que reduzcan el proteccionismo y'sobre todo e liminen los subsidios. -19- Ojal\u00e1 que la CEE Y los dem\u00e1s Estados industrializados que practican las diversas formas de proteccionismo oigan las voces como las que el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia hn dicho en la reciente Asamblea General de la Organizaci\u00f3n de los Estados Americanos:\"Si realmente se quiere asegurar un proceso de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico sostenido que asegure el empleo y la esta-bilidad social pol\u00edtica en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo, las naciones industrializadas tendr\u00e1n que abrir de nuevo sus mercados y permitir el a cceso de las exportaciones provenientes del Tercer Mundo. Si no exportamos, moriremos, si no existen mercados para nuestros productos, Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe ver\u00e1n fustradas sus expectativas de desarrollo y progreso social\". Indica este documento b\u00e1sico que entre 1980 y 1986 el PIB real per c\u00e1pida en Africa ha disminuido en m\u00e1s del 11 por ciento y es probable que se reduzca el ritmo de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico del Lejano Oriente, y de manera m\u00e1s considerable el de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. Esto justifica la afirmaci\u00f3n del p\u00e1rrafo 15 seg\u00fan el cu al \"las primeras estimaciones con respecto a 1986 son poco alentadoras para la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo\". La extensi\u00f3n de la pobreza, del hambre, de la malnutrici\u00f3n abarca todos ios rincones del mundo en desarrollo, mientras que los Estados industrializados siguen disfrutando de su opulenta sociedad de consumo. Todo este documento confirma c\u00f3mo la inmensa deuda externa del Tercer Mundo y las pol\u00edticas prot eccionistas de los Estados desarrollados han afectado considerablemente el crecimiento econ\u00f3-mico y la vida misma de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Aunque en ocasiones bajen los precios, ios pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo no est\u00e1n en condiciones de importar alimentos; tienen que escoger entre el servicio de la deuda externa o las importaciones para sobrevivir, ya que del aumento de su crecimiento econ\u00f3mico notienen ninguna esperanza, tienen que decidir entre el hambre y un m\u00ednimo de desarrollo. Esos hechos conforman el contenido del p\u00e1rrafo 30, seg\u00fan el cual, las importaciones de cereales 1986/87 alcanzar\u00e1n una cifra muy inferior a la de 1984/85. \"Algunos importadores no podr\u00e1n comprar cereales, debido a ios problemas financieros\" concluye el p\u00e1rrafo 30. Como ha dicho el profesor Islam, los recursos externos para la agricultura descienden considerablemente. El p\u00e1rrafo 35 habla del Fondo Internacional de Desarrollo Agr\u00edcola (FIDA). Esta referencia se\u00f1ala brevemente la crisis del FIDA, organismo que naci\u00f3 bajo tan buenas esperanzas a fines de 1977 para beneficio de peque\u00f1os y medianos agricultores, y que ahora est\u00e1 declinando lentamente. El FIDA est\u00e1 adelantando una intensa campa\u00f1a para tratar de que sobreviva. El Gobierno de Colombia viene apoyando esos esfuerzos. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia propone que este Consejo apoye toda iniciativa seria, realista y positiva para que el FIDA logre sobrevivir sobre bases estables. La parte final del p\u00e1rrafo 35 hace referencia al nuevo servicio de pr\u00e9stamos del Fondo Monetario Internacional, con relaci\u00f3n a la asistencia para equilibrar la balanza de pagos sobre los pr\u00e9stamos hechos en condiciones de favor a los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos. Ese nuevo Servicio se ha llamado de Ajuste Estructural. Seguramente este nuevo Servicio del FMI tendr\u00e1 tantastrabas y limitaciones como el llamado Servicio Cerealero que s\u00f3lo pudo ser utilizado por un n\u00famero muy limitado de pa\u00edses en desarrollo, cinco solamente, En efecto, se dice que 60 Estados tienen acceso a ese Servicio, que en gran parte se u tilizar\u00e1 para apoyar actividades agropecuarias, pero ya dos grandes pa\u00edses en desarrollo, China e India, han dicho que no utilizar\u00e1n ese Servicio. -20- La frase final del p\u00e1rrafo 39 afirma que el'Convenio Internacional del Trigo y el Convenio sobre Ayuda Alimentaria se renovaron sin cambios ni disposiciones econ\u00f3micas importantes por otros tres anos. De nada vali\u00f3 la insistencia de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo para que el Convenio Internacional del Trigo contenga cl\u00e1usulas econ\u00f3micas que lo hagan verdaderamente operante y no in\u00fatil como en su forma actual. Vanos tambi\u00e9n fueron ios esfuerzos, los reconocemos, de la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea para que eso se lograra a trav\u00e9s del llamado Grupo de Reflexi\u00f3n que propuso la CEE. Como se puede ver todo es negativo para los pa\u00edses en desarrollo en este estudio de la Situaci\u00f3n de la Agricultura y de la Alimentaci\u00f3n. El p\u00e1rrafo 51 dice que \"para muchos pa\u00edses en desarrollo 1980/84 fue un per\u00edodo d ecepcionante en lo que respecta a su situaci\u00f3n nutricional\". El p\u00e1rrafo 53 se\u00f1ala que africanos y latinoamericanos fueron los m\u00e1s afectados. En s\u00edntesis, el hambre y la roaInutrici\u00f3n aumentan. El Papa Juan Pablo II ha dicho que \"resulta intolerable que se logren grandes progresos en el espacio mientras en la tierra millones de seres humanos pad ecen hambre\". El nuevo Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia, doctor Virgilio Barco, declar\u00f3 ante el 41 per\u00edodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas, en curso, que: \"la humanidad puede si se lo propone desterrar \u00e9l hambre. Quiero solicitar a la Comunidad Internacional, dijo el Presidente de Colombia, que reafirme su compromiso con la erradicaci\u00f3n de la pobreza absoluta. Entre las multiples amenazas a nuestro mundo ninguna ha sido tan permanente como la pobreza\". El Presidente de Colombia ha propuesto una reuni\u00f3n que se celebrar\u00eda en nuestro pa\u00eds el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o dedicado a buscar f\u00f3rmulas para erradicar la pobreza absoluta en Am\u00e9rica Latina y El Caribe. Los 26 pa\u00edses integrantes del Sistema Econ\u00f3mico Latinoamericano, SELA, en su \u00faltima reuni\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la Asamblea General de la OEA que se celebra en Guatemala han manifestado que \"acogemos'con entusiasmo la iniciativa formulada por el Presidente de Colombia en la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas a fin de emprender una lucha activa y coordinada para erradicar la pobreza absoluta de nues tra regi\u00f3n, con la cooperaci\u00f3n de los Organismos y Agencias Internacionales competentes\". Es una idea que est\u00e1 apenas en formaci\u00f3n. En la medida en que se concrete, el Gobierno de Colombia espera contar con la valiosa cooperaci\u00f3n y asistencia de la FAO en los campos de la agricultura y de la alimentaci\u00f3n, Organizaci\u00f3n que tantos y tan eficaces servicios viene prestando a nuestra regi\u00f3n.

Zhu PEIRONG (China) (Original language Chinese):I would like to thank the Secretariat for providing us with up- to-date information on the world economy and on the world agricultural development. I am sure that such background knowledge will facilitate our deliberations on this subject. We have taken note of the fact that although this year has witnessed increases in the agricultural production and the world economy as a whole, most of the developing countries are istill facing a critical situation in their economy and agricultural development. The problems of food and trade for agricultural commodities as well as the problem of debt-servicing in many developing countries need to be addressed with greater efforts in the coming years. We are happy to learn that fairly good harvests have been recorded in the African continent over the past two years and as a result the severe food shortage has been eased to a modest extent. However, they still have the arduous task of rehabilitating and developing their agriculture to accomplish. Under a grave economic situation, Latin America has not made remarkable progress in food production. Though Asia has achieved some progress in food production over the past two years, restricted by high population density and limited land resources, it is facedwith a heavy task of achieving sustained growth by increasing inputs and investment and improving technology. All this indicates that the development of food production is closely related to that of the overall social economy, and depends on whether the developed countries can terms to the developing countries. Therefore the issue of food will remain a high priority to be solved in a long period ahead. -24- What concerns us most is that the international trade for agricultural commodities has experienced no improvement. The developing countries are hit by the growing tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, the continuous decline of the price for raw materials and the deteriorating terms of trade. When considering the agenda item on the state of food and agriculture at the 23rd session of the FAO Conference last year, we expressed the hope that the international community would give this issue serious thought and eventually find a solution. Not long ago, ministers from 74 GATT member countries met in the Uruguayan seaside resort of Punta Este and regulations have on agricultural trade, improving the environment competition and eliminating the varied forms subsidies to gradually achieve the objective of liberalizing trade. All these measures havea positive impact, and therefore we welcome this progress. At the same time, we wish to emphasize that although this part of the declaration has expressed the common wish of the participating countries, the most important thing is to translate it into action. We sincerely hope that FAO and other relevant UN agencies will continue to hold consultations on this issue in the future. The United Nations Assembly has recently adopted a resolution on food and agriculture, which shows that the issue of food and agriculture has once again attracted the attention of the international community. We welcome such a move. As we have expressed our views on the issue of food and trade for agricultural commodities touched upon in the resolution, we now would like to highlight the issue of financial resources used for agriculture which stands as a separate point in the document. We have noted with concern the declining trend of both the multilateral resources and private investment. The Chinese delegation has always held that the economy of all funds and technology in promoting their agricultural production and in turn they will benefit by obtaining raw material and markets from the developing countries. Now the paradoxical phenomenon that demand for agricultural products has already been fully met, nor does it meanthat investment in agriculture will not achieve satisfactory returns. If we look at this problem with a wise and farsightedview, we believe that with the economic development in the developing countries and with the rehabilitation of agriculture in particular, the newly increased purchasing power will be tremendous. What is left for us to do is to tap this potential and seek markets in development. We hope that development should be our common objective. On the other hand, we should not lose sight of other problems in such as overfishing or pollution and the near extinction of some plant germplasm resources and animal breeds. All this suggests that we are faced with the urgent task of ensuring sustained growth of agriculture by conserving and regenerating agricultural resources. We suggest that study on this issue be included in the next biennal programme of work of FAO, and discussed in due course and that decisions be made accordingly. -25- China's agricultural development in recent years is mentioned in the document. Now please allow me to make a few additions. This year, though hit by frequent natural calamities, produced fairly good harvests. The latest information reveals that food production will increase over last year but will be still lower than the peak year of 1984. Livestock and fishery production and township enterprises continue to grow. However, the of cash as cotton and sugar-bearing crops will drop compared to last year due to enlarged sown area under grain crops, and reduction of the area under cash crops. In general, China still has a low level of per capita foodgrain consumption, and food production performance varies among provinces. The problem of feeding and clothing the people in the areas with about 10% of the total population still needs to be solved. Therefore in the 7th Five-Year Plan period starting from this year, food production is listed as a priority for development. Great efforts will be made to strengthen the construction of commodity grain bases, build up a service network for agriculture, implement reforms in rural circulation and help the remote and poor areas to raise their agricultural productivity by providing funds and technology in an effort to improve the general performance of food and agricultural production in the country. As more than 20 items will be discussed at the current Council session, we have a heavy task before us. We shall join efforts with the other delegates and strive to make the session a success through full consultation. Vanrob ISARANKURA (Thailand): First I wish to join the other delegates in expressing our happiness in seeing you again in the Chair of this important meeting of FAO. I can assure you of the cooperation of my delegation in accomplishing the goals of this Council. I would also like to congratulate the two vice-chairmen on their election. My delegation has listened with great interest and deep concern to the excellent introduction made by DrIslam of the current world food and agriculture situation. We have also carefully studied the documents CL 90/2 and CL 90/2-Sup. 1 and we find that they give a very comprehensive and important report. However, we also find that on the Chapter of Regional Review, in the Asia Section of the document CL 90/2, there is no report about the situation in Thailand. To provide more information at this juncture my delegation wishes to submit to this Council a brief comment on the food and agriculture situation in Thailand. The situation in our country can be described as having both a positive and a negative aspect to it. On the positive side Thailand is experiencing, as never before in its recent history, a super abundance of food resources. However, on the negative side sharply prices posing a serious threat to the economic survival of our farmers and have already contributed to a substantialslowdown in Thailand's economic growth. In 1985, agricultural production in Thailand recorded an overall growth rate of 3.8 percent. figure is somewhat lower than the 4.5 percent target set by the fifth Five Year Plan, 1985 is the third consecutive year characterised by high crop production. The production of rice, corn and sugar cane, (to mention just some of the major crops) livestock continued to expand and develop. Turning to the documents now before us. My delegation fully agrees with the view contained in paragraph 8 of document CL 90/2 Sup. 1 that countries in South East Asia suffered the most serious setback in export earning in 1985. This conclusion can be confirmed by situation in Thailand. To give one glaring example, exports of of such exports dropped as much as 25 percent due to the sharp decline in prices. But agriculture is the backbone of the Thai economy and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Our agricultural products must be able to fetch reasonable prices on the world market to ensure the economic survival of the farmers and to maintain the incentive for sustained high productivity. low commodity prices will, sooner or later, drive out world trade conditions should be improved and readjusted in such a way as to assure free and fair competition. In particular, national measures such as subsidies, which trade distortions and artificially low export prices, should be abandoned. same lifting of non-tariff the and The State-of Food and Agriculture 1986 provides, as in earlier versions, a comprehensive and balanced description and analysis of the world food and agriculture situation in the first half of the eighties up to 1986. The document testifies to the paramount role that FAO plays in collecting, analysing and presenting information to enable the international community to monitor and understand world agriculture. Indeed, it enhances the policy making of the international community with regard to food and agriculture. The State of World Food and Agriculture, particularly in the developing countries, presents some aspects which are duly recorded and systematised in the FAO review, first and foremost through the regional focus especially on Africa, although the situation in the other important regions is no means overlooked. It also role of agriculture and suppor ting overall economic development. This implies discussion on the most adequate ways and means of improving agricultural production. In this context due accent is given to rural development, domestic policies and financing. The document emphasises that the main source of agricultural development also with regard to financial resources is generated in the developing countries themselves. This seems a fact, but it we are reminded that the international donor community can only be a catalyst in a development process implemented by the developing countries. In this respect we wish to commend the analysis carried out by FAO on the causes of the African agricultural crisis as well as the policy implications already carried out by a number of African states. The general picture of the economic environment and the state of food and agriculture is not very encouraging. It is true that a series of indicators testify to a positive development in fields such as inflation, increasing production in developing countries and improved nutrition standards in a number of countries. With respect to earlier sessions we can finally also note a step forward in terms of the agreement on the second replenishment of IFAD and the holding of the General Assembly's Special Session on Africa. However, the Report shows that the constraints are heavier than the improvements. In output increases in the developing countries the growth in production does not (as in Africa) keep pace with population growth. Farm productivity is not improving and the gap in nutritional status lower income countries widening. gap is particular, is faced with a serious deterioration in terms of trade and with increasing debt capital flows to developing fell drastically in the first half growth in official commitments is recovering, namely in terms of concessional contributions. At a special Africa, together the in Africa which, thanks to ready donor support, also by my Government, so far successful. We commend our Secretariat's intention to secure in the a coordinated prevention against locust upsurges. In conclusion, I should like to express my satisfaction with the present state of the Food and Agriculture Report, which is more than a statutory report. By reason of the longer term analysis and the special chapter on financing, it will provide a number of nations with a more efficient and critical information when presented to the next Conference. The Report helps member states in assessing and shaping their policies to improve food and agricultural production. Finally, I should like to refer to the European Community statement on this matter later on. J. R. LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Mexico): Mexico se congratula de que dirija usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, tan eficazmente nuestros trabajos; asimismo expresamos nuestra felicitaci\u00f3n de agradecimiento al Director General por la magn\u00edfica intervenci\u00f3n que nos hizo esta ma\u00f1ana. Agradecemos al doctor Islam su presentaci\u00f3n y a la Secretar\u00eda la preparaci\u00f3n del documento que ahora estudiamos. -27- Se\u00f1or Presidente, la probreza es sin duda, y as\u00ed se reconoce universalmente, la causa fundamental de la inseguridad alimentaria y por tanto el aumento en el ingreso es el factor m\u00e1s importante en el mejoramiento de las dietas y en el combate del hambre. En esta d\u00e9cada se ha reducido o estancado el ingreso promedio de gran parte de la poblaci\u00f3n mundial. La pobreza absoluta se ha extendido, como nos lo ha recordado el delegado de Colombia, y con ello el hambre y la malnutrici\u00f3n se han exacerbado. Los excedentes de los pa\u00edses industrializados se acumulan, deprimen precios, cargan sus econom\u00edas e inducen a pr\u00e1cticas desleales y proteccionismos que se preven cada vez m\u00e1s agresivos. A pesar de la afluencia de alimentos, los hambrientos no pueden traducir sus n ecesidades en demandas efectivas. La reactivaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de muchos pa\u00edses desarrollados y la virtual recesi\u00f3n en otros no han es timulado la econom\u00eda de los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados, por el contrario el empeoramiento de la carga de la deuda externa, la ausencia de cr\u00e9ditos y de financiaci\u00f3n externos, los movimientos incontrolados de los tipos de cambio, las tasas de inter\u00e9selevadas, la reducci\u00f3n de los t\u00e9rminos del intercambio, el proteccionismo, la contracci\u00f3n de los mercados y la sustituci\u00f3n de productos de exportaci\u00f3n del mundo subdesarrollado, as\u00ed como la fuga de capitales y cerebros y las est\u00e9riles y peligrosas pol\u00edticas de austeridad, todo ello ha impuesto severos retrocesos ai crecimiento econ\u00f3mico, al empleo y al nivel y distribuci\u00f3n de los ingresos entre regiones y entre grupos poblacionales. Se cuestiona, inclusive, la posibilidad misma del desarrollo futuro y lo acertado de los modelos de desarrollo adoptados. Dif\u00edcilmente se puede seguir hablando de pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Cabe, quiz\u00e1s, otra expresi\u00f3n que califique su atraso y que denote la necesidad de transitar en otro sentido. Se hace cada vez m\u00e1s patente lairracionalidad que desperdicia recursos econ\u00f3micos escasos en la producci\u00f3n de bienes y servicios socialmente innecesarios o de baja prioridad. Baste recordar que unas cuantas horas del derroche en el ejercicio del presupuesto armamentista anual de algunas potencias es equivalente a su contribuci\u00f3n total bianual a la FAO. Recordemos tambi\u00e9n que las empresas agroalimentarias est\u00e1n en el negocio no para satisfacer n ecesidades b\u00e1sicas, sino para obtener m\u00e1ximas ganancias. De ah\u00ed que no deba sorprendernos que busquen, mediante todas las t\u00e9cnicas, ampliar mercados, moldear viejas necesidades, imponer nuevas t\u00e9cnicas que promuevan un consumo de todo tipo de productos alimenticios. As\u00ed, por ejemplo, se usan aditivos que atentan contra la salud, colorantes que enga\u00f1an, o se aplican plaguicidas que permiten una m\u00e1xima producci\u00f3n, pero cuya toxicidad contamina el medio ambiente y envenena al consumidor. Recordemos tambi\u00e9n la acumulaci\u00f3n costosa y el derroche de excedentes alimentarios frente a la indigencia y la muerte por hambre de millones de seres humanos. Muchos so n, sin duda, los ejemplos y to do esto tiene tambi\u00e9n su propia l\u00f3gica que explica la visi\u00f3n c\u00edclica ydiscontinuade que ve\u00eda el delegado de Colombia. En todo caso, podemos calificar esa l\u00f3gica o ese sistema de irracional e injusto. Esa irracionalidad e injusticia priva en los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados como efecto de su dependencia econ\u00f3micay a intereses geopol\u00edticos de las potencias. El subdesarrollo del sector agr\u00edcola y su bajaprioridad en los planes y presupuestos nacionales, as\u00ed como el cambio desventajoso, la estructura de cultivos y patrones alimentarios promovidos a la par de la urbanizaci\u00f3n en sustituci\u00f3n de alimentos tradicionales, son muestra de esa irracionalidad. Son en buena parte causa de la crisis agr\u00edcola y alimentaria vigente en muchos pa\u00edses. La situaci\u00f3n de Africa es particularmente precaria y nadie debe sentirse tranquilo de que en el \u00faltimo ano su crisis no haya sido tan grave. Apoyamos en todo lo que valenlas iniciativas que esa regi\u00f3n adopte y los esfuerzos del Director General de responder a las prioridades de ese Continente; pero un cambio cualitativo en su forma de enfrentar el futuro se hace imperativo. Reformar estructuras como las propuestas en el documento que estudiamos, junto con una cooperaci\u00f3n internacional m\u00e1s generosa y menos condicionada a obtener ventajas econ\u00f3micas o pol\u00edticas es necesario. Sin duda, la superaci\u00f3n de conflictos internos y regional es, particularmentela pol\u00edtica desestablizadora que fomenta Sud Africa escondici\u00f3n para un porvenir m\u00e1s estable y justo. -28- No nos deja de preocupar tampoco el deterioro de la seguridad alimentaria en otras regiones, particularmente en Am\u00e9rica Latina. Lo explican razones estructurales internas, como serecoge en los p\u00e1rrafos 135 a 139 y en el 142, pero tambi\u00e9n obedece a factores externos, como bien lo identifica el documento, como la propia crisis financiera, las deudas, la recesi\u00f3n internacional, el proteccionis mo, la inestab ilidad de precios, el deterioro de los t\u00e9rminos de intercambio y, en fin, el menor flujo de la asistencia externa. En estas condiciones, subrayamos la prioridad absoluta que debe recibir el sector agr\u00edcola a nivel nacional e internacional como f\u00f3rmula indispensable para la sobrevivencia del mundo en que vivimos y como sustento de todo crecimiento econ\u00f3mico en los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo. Puntualizamos la necesidad de crear cambios cua litativos en las estructuras de cultivo y en los patrones del consumo de alimentos, impulsando prioritariamente los productos y alimentos aut\u00f3ctonos, y aquellos que conlleven una menor dependencia externa y que mejor se adapten a las condiciones agro-clim\u00e1ticas y socioecon\u00f3micas, particularmente de las zonas de temporal. Los mal llamados cereales secundarios, como el ma\u00edz, y por otra parte las ra\u00edces tub\u00e9rculos, pl\u00e1tanos y otras frutas y legumbres deben de reivindicarse en la econom\u00eda agraria y en las dietas de nuestros pa\u00edses;la disponibilidad de insumos agr\u00edcolas suficientes y adecuados es esencial para aumentar la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y la suficiencia alimentaria. De ah\u00ed que propongamos. de nuevo, que en el concepto ampliado de seguridad alimentaria se adicione a los insumos agr\u00edcolas, tales como semillas, fertilizantes, plaguicidas, maquinaria agr\u00edcola, cr\u00e9dito, etc. como factoresindispensables para la consecuci\u00f3n de tal objetivo y que se contemplen adecuadamente en toda estrategia de seguridad alimentaria. En vista de que en un mundo interdependiente como el que vivimos, la seguridad alimentaria es una responsabilidad colectiva, debemos promover la cooperaci\u00f3n multilateral y el car\u00e1cter multilateral de la ayuda. S\u00f3lo as\u00ed se puede prever una respuesta congruente a los intereses fundamentales de cada pa\u00eds beneficiario. Nos preocupa, por tanto la tendencia a bilateralizarla. Rechazamos cualquier tipo de condicionamiento de la asistencia externa y de la ayuda en funci\u00f3n de prejuicios en todo caso, ideol\u00f3gicos e intereses contrarios al prop\u00f3sito mismo de la cooperaci\u00f3n internacional. En vista delo que se indica en el p\u00e1rrafo 33 y dela situaci\u00f3n precaria del FIDA, descrita en t\u00e9rminos muy sencillos en el p\u00e1rrafo 35, hacemos un nuevo llamado a la Comunidad Internacional para que incremente la totalidad de las corrientes de fondos internacionales destinados al aumento de la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y sus compromisos oficiales de asistencia externa a la agricultura por la v\u00eda multilateral. Tomamos nota y agradecemos la calidad del apartado tercero del documento 90/2 y de que la financiaci\u00f3n del desarrollo agr\u00edcola en este decenio se ha visto seriamente afectada. Ello responde a causas coyunturales y a razones estructurales que invitan a fomentar la confianza colectiva, la cooperaci\u00f3n Sur-Sur, la cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica y econ\u00f3mica entre pa\u00edses en desarrollo con usos m\u00e1s prudentes de los recursos disponibles, y una intervenci\u00f3n m\u00e1s eficaz del Estado para organizar los mercados internos que estimulen el crecimiento agr\u00edcola. Debe, sin duda, crearse un clima econ\u00f3mico m\u00e1s favorable a los productores del campo, a la inversi\u00f3n productiva p\u00fablica y privada y al uso de t\u00e9cnicas, variedades e insumos que reduzcan la dependencia del exterior, promuevan el consumo de ali mentos aut\u00f3ctonos y respeten y consideren las necesidades y las posib ilidades de los consumidores. Pedimos a la FAO que profundice en este estudio y que nos lo presente con todos los beneficios de esa profundidad en la pr\u00f3xima Conferencia de la FAO. Debemos advertir, sin embargo, que el peso de la deuda externa impide, y muy probablemente impedir\u00e1, la recuperaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y espec\u00edficamente agr\u00edcola en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados. Subrayamos que dif\u00edcilmente habr\u00e1 soluci\u00f3n a la crisis econ\u00f3mica internacional hasta que no se resuelva el problema de la deuda. Sus efectos en la agricultura, la alimentaci\u00f3n y las importaciones seguir\u00e1n condenando a la mayor parte del mundo a un estado permanente deinseguridad alimentaria. -29- Rechazamos, pues, las pr\u00e1cticas prot eccionistas que han mermado el valor y la posib ilidad de expor-taci\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados y que han alimentado el c\u00edrculo vicioso del financiamenlo al desarrollo agr\u00edcola y del subdesarrollo en general. Instamos a la Comunidad Internacional a que encuentre las f\u00f3rmulas para estabilizar los precios y mercados internacionales mediante convenios, acuerdos de productos b\u00e1sicos, la ratificaci\u00f3n del Convenio constitutivo del Fondo Com\u00fan y la incorporaci\u00f3n de cl\u00e1usulas en el Convenio Internacional del Trigo y otros sobre, ayuda alimentaria. Insistimos en que se incorporen las cuestiones relativas al comercio agr\u00edcola en el programa de negociaciones comerciales y multilaterales del GATT. Pedimos al Director General que nos mantenga informado de la evoluci\u00f3n de tales negociaciones y de la situaci\u00f3n de los acuerdos y convenios inter nacionales de productos b\u00e1sicos. Finalmente, reclamamos de nuevo la presentaci\u00f3n de un estudio que ha venido preparando la FAO a so licitud de varios pa\u00edses sobre la participaci\u00f3n de las empresas transnacionales en este sector, en vista del dominio preponderante que tienen en el comercio exterior de productos b\u00e1sicos, en la transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda agr\u00edcola y alimentaria y en el comportamiento y volumen del cr\u00e9dito y la inver si\u00f3n externa e interna. No queremos que pruritos t\u00e9cnicos permitan posponer la presentaci\u00f3n de tal estudio. Hoy solicitamos enf\u00e1ticamente que se presente en la pr\u00f3xima reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Seguri dad . Alimentaria en abril del pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. Octavio Rainho da SILVA NEVES (Brazil): We are very glad to see you again in the chair. We should also like to congratulate the Director-General on his statement this morning. To begin with, I should like to make mine the views expressed by Saudi Arabia, Colombia and Congo in particular. My delegation wishes to thank Dr Islam and the Secretariat for the presentation of a very important and well balanced analysis on the state of food and agriculture. My delegation is pre-pared to give general support to the findings and the conclusions of the study under consideration. The first chapter of the document pays attention to the problem debt, and is a major obstacle to a resumption of growth in many developing countries. \" However, the document fails to already been stressed in other documents prepared by this Organization, that the servicing of the external debt has led the developing countries to play a new role in the international scene:the role of net exporters of capital to the industrialized world. According to the Inter-American Development Bank, La tin America has transferre d more than $100 billio n to wealthier creditors in the last four years. My country al one has been transferring ar ound $11 b illion a year for the service of its debt. We have made considerable efforts to honour our engagements through the expansion of our exports and reforms in our economy. As a great part of the developing world, Brazil has been confronted, on the one hand, with the need to increase its exports in order to service the external debt and, on the other hand, with a decline in the price of its main products, the shrinkage of developed countries' markets, the overall shortage of credit and financing, and the widespread protectionism of the industrialized world. In order to be able to honour their and as well to rates developing countries must count on fairer arrangements in regard to their external debt and as well on a better access free of artificial competitiveness of subsidized goods of their products to international markets. Debt payments relief will as well permit us to import the goods we need to sustain our growth and eradicate the areas of absolute poverty. In regard to-absolute poverty, I am pleased to inform the Council that my delegation fully supports the proposal made by Mr Virgilio Barco, President of Colombia, at the United Nations Assembly for a conference on this question. -30- The prospects shown by the document under review for economic growth in developing countries in 1986 are not promising at all. For Latin America there is a forecast of a pronounced deceleration in economic growth and a continuing fall in terms of trade. Whilst considering useful the chapter dedicated to Latin America and the Caribbean, my delegation believes that not enough attention has been given to the concerns expressed at the Nineteenth Regional Conference held last August in Bridgetown, Barbados. In this connection, I should like to recall two paragraphs of the Report of the Nineteenth Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean. Paragraph 13 of that report, just distributed, states that the Regional Conference highlights the fact that Latin America and the Caribbean were undergoing a serious and unprecedented economic crisis intensified by the heavy burden the fall in export prices, adverse terms of trade, and by a large transfer of resources out of the region which had led to a reduction in per caput income in food supplies and an increase in poverty and malnutrition, especially in the most vulnerable population groups. In paragraph 20, the Conference expresses its satisfaction for the Director-General's acceptance in his statement of the suggestion made by the representatives of the countries of the region to FAO that the Organization conduct a specific study on the economic situation, as well as its implications for the long-term development of the region in what pertains to food and agriculture. In this respect, they request the Director-General to allocate the necessary resources to initiate this study as soon as possible. They also request that the study contemplate the formulation of a Plan of Action including the role of FAO, as well as that of governments themselves, and the cooperation of other international organizations interested in the development of the region. My delegation wishes, once again, to appeal developed and the developing countries in trade matters. Not only in relation to a more rational and stable international trade, as stressed by the representative of Mexico, particularly in connection with Africa, but as well in relation to the suspension of domestic measures that adversely affect world markets. As to the question of protectionism, Mr Chairman, let us hope that theEconomist's this well-known British Magazine's prediction-the Economist , the last one I believe, on November 15th, becomes true. That magazine stated that in the richand mainly industrial countries, farmers are paid too much so they produce too much. In the poor and mainly agricultural countries farmers are paid too little so they produce too little. Europeans trample cognac grapes into industrial alcohol. Americans fill rock mountain caverns with butter. Japanese pay eight to ten times the world price for their bowl of rice. Meanwhile, many millions of Asians and Africans live in real poverty and go hungry to bed. They end by saying \"do not despair, the mistakes are Properly staged and leave the world better off. \"They may be optimistic but we hope that this prediction will come true. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): We would like to begin by complimenting the Secretariat for the well prepared and, at the same time, thought-pr ovoking and s timulating document before us. In our opinion CL/90/2 and its supplement not only gives a very accurate picture of the state of food and agriculture in 1985 and the first half of 1986, but they also contain interesting analyses on major issues confronting agriculture and development in general. We think that these analyses deserve some comments and we shall try to do so later in our intervention. We would also like to for the item, although his mastery of the matter and his skills of presentation are beyond praise. The state of food and agriculture in the period under consideration contains, as in the past, positive and negative elements and, alas, again, as in the past years, reasons for satisfaction are by far out-numbered by the causes for concern. The list of the causes for concern which stem mainly from the still deteriorating overall economic environment is quite long :slowdownin the world output of goods and services and a more dramatic slowdown in the growth of world trade and especially in agricultural trade;the and interest rates, the current trends in prices of oil and other commodities and the momentum of growth in industrial countries. And, last but not least, theunresolved debt question. these we especially affecting the agricultural there are too. Despite the deteriorating economic environment developing countries as a whole could maintain their food production growth and this growth was more evenly spread than in the past. the agriculture in this continent. Among the reasons for satisfaction we could have mentioned the slowing down of the inflation almost worldwide, were it not caused by the sharp drops in commodity prices and the contraction of the world trade which, by themselves, are graver than any single negative factor I have mentioned. Indeed, we believe that trade is the key to the overall growth and consequently a vital factor in development. We still think that exports, and in particular, agricultural exports constitute the major means for a developing world to ensure its growth. To deprive the developing countries of the only means to pay for the capital goods they need, will not only doom these countries, but also, given the reality of interdependence, will world economy as a whole, thereby further endangering world peace and security. To give an. example, how can we try to solve the indebtedness problem when the debtors only possibility for reimbursement is \"shrinking more and more. We do not believe either that there can be a substitute for growth of developing countries' exportsor for the ensuing growth in world trade. There is no doubt that development rests mainly on the efforts optimization of their country's own resources should be, and most of the time, is the main aim of developing countries' governments. It is also country spends, its measure of success is limited by the world economic conditions, trade playing a crucial-role in this regard. It is with these thoughts in mind, that we would like to make a few brief comments on the analysis ; and conclusions, in our opinion, seem to emanate from the document before us. We would like to refer, in particular, to the section D, namely Major Issues of the document, starting from paragraph 294. In this section it appeared to us that the document considers the reduction of export markets due to various reasons a fact \"the long-term viability of agricultural exports as a major source of growth is not promising\". Starting from this point, the document concentrates on the idea that developing countries should more and more depend on the domestic and markets and of suggestions for structural adjustments, in particular in the agricultural sector of the developing countries in view of the shrinking hopes before international markets and external sources of financing. The broad message of the Secretariat to the developing countries is, it seemed to us, \"since the neighbourhood has gone wrong, put your own house in order\". As we said earlier, we agree entirely with the last part of this proposition. Developing countries should put their own house in order. Indeed, most of them are undergoing a process of adjustment despite its of heavily on external factors such as world financial systems, trade, transfer of technology? How is it possible to generate sufficient domestic production surplus to finance development without external outlets? The document does not elaborate upon the positive adjustment measures and structural changes that need to be adopted by the developed world. It does not mention the policy approaches to pursued the principles of comparative advantage free competition. We are certain that the Secretariat's intention was not to ignore this side of the question. Perhaps it was a matter of emphasis or style, and it can be argued that policies criticized in almost all the organs and papers of the Organization. -32- In his brilliant address this morning, the Director-General forcefully point. has underlined these unfair practices. All we wished to see in the documents was a more balanced presentation between the duties and obligations of both parts of the world, since, as I have said, we believe that no solution can be found to the issues of development and sustained world growth without the concerted action of the whole community of nations. Speaking of trade, we should not fail to mention our satisfaction in seeing that the following GATT round of negotiations may be off to a good start with the agreement to discuss the problems of trade in agricultural commodities. This slender ray of hope, (as the Director-General has put it this morning) should be jealously kept alive and should give way to improvements towards the liberalization of trade. We note also with satisfaction the pledge of the Director-General to commit FAO to provide all the assistance that may be required to further the GATT discussion. We submit that FAO can be of great help to developing countries in particular, not only by way of producing statis tics and furnishing information, but also through a closer cooperation with the GATT Secretariat on all matters falling within its expertise. Before concluding I would like to touch briefly upon an entirely new danger confronting world agriculture, namely the risk of contamination by radioactivity. The grave example of the Chernobyl accident emphasized the need for urgent and comprehensive international action to minimize the effects of such disasters in the future. We congratulate FAO for its quick response to this need. Among the measures to be considered we attach particular importance to the definition of common standards since the actual inconsistent application of standards started to create an additional barrier to trade in agricultural goods, especially in Europe. Many countries, including my arbitary practices by the importers. We hope that work on common standards will be speedily concluded and common agreement will be soon reached so such damages can be limited. Malikana LISWANISO (Zambia): In the first instance, my delegation would like to welcome you back to the chair and to congratulate your Vice Chairmen on their election to the bureau. We have no doubt that you will, as usual, steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion. My delegation has very carefully the document CL 90/2 and its supplement and I must congratulate the Secretariat for producing a detailed document which will give us a lot of food for thought. Despite various measures taken worrisome to my delegation to note that the world food situation is still far from satisfactory. The document under consideration has attempted to give a clear analysis of the global food situation. It has also highlighted some of the major factors which have contributed to the current unsatisfactory world food situation. I shall very briefly comment on some of the points contained in the report before us. The elements of, and the increased World countries, their national economies decrease largely because of lack of access to the world markets, more and more have they failed to finance their agricultural development projects. This is mainly so because most of the agricultural inputs required for boosting agricultural production, such as fer tilizers, insecticides, animal drugs, machinery, to mention but a few, have to be imported and paid for in convertible currencies, the serious scarcity of which needs no elaboration these foods. long-term that leads to widespread famine as evidenced in Africa 1984/5. The African food crisis of the 1980s wa s a bitter experience and a lesson to all of us here. The International Community should not allow such an incident to happen again anywhere on this globe. -33- It is my delegation's view that the formulation and adoption of national food strategies is the answer to the creation of viable economies in the developing countries. These strategies should be reducing against agriculture in the policy framework and should aim at maximising the use of the available for instance, and China, these policy changes about rapid increases in food producion and agricultural output. In Africa other developing the macro-economic reforms brought a lot of hardships to the governments and the people in that their implementation required capital;it brought about massive costs of local foods and services, unemployment and, in some cases, political unrest. I wish to add that, apart from external aid to attain self sufficiency in food production. It is therefore my hope that the developing countries will get more external aid than what is currently available. It is unfortunate that at a time when the prospects for economic recovery in many developing countries are promising, at such a critical moment, we are at the same time witnessing a fall in most of the official commitments for external assistance to agriculture (OCA). At this state of development, when the Third World countries are overburdened by foreign debts is required. The problems facing the International Development Association (IDA) and in particular the way the second replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) was concluded, are phenomena which should be a source of concern to the entire International Community. IDA and concessional development assistance to least developing countries, and in the case of the latter, it specializes in the plight of the disadvantaged rural communities. The role IFAD has played in raising the standard of living of the peasants, the rural poor, the landless and the small scale fishermen in the countries it is operating cannot be doubted. Besides, IFAD projects have small scale farmers and its efficiency in executing development projects have been recognised the world over. My delegation is therefore appealing to all the countries represented here to support IFAD not only morally but also financially. We do hope as the 10th Governing Council meets this December, agreement w ill be reached on the future funding of IFAD. Let me now turn briefly to the question of externally funded of in projects is question of aid effectiveness calls for close scrutiny and review. I do not deem it necessary to catalogue all the possible causes of some externally funded projects. Suffice to a r eceiving end;(b)at times no proper mechanisms are worked for the nationals to take up the management. of the schemes when the foreign experts pull out at the end of the contract;(c)the training element is sometimes not seriously incorporated in the project; (d)project equipment is often delivered late and in some cases such equipment is not suitable to local conditions;(e) at the end of the project period the equipments are taken away by the donor or executing agency;(f)a number of have allocated for project developing countries have to pick up in productivity from where they are now, this issue of aid effectiveness requires attention. My delegation is requesting FAO to undertake a study on this subject and report to this Council accordingly. Indeed if a similar study has already been done, we would like to be informed of the problems and the suggested remedies. -34- Another area which needs to be addressed here is the question of Fertilizer Aid. It has been documented in many FAO documents and elsewhere that in the countries where large amount of fertilizers are being used per hectare there is more productivity than in areas where less fertilizers are being applied. Africa has now the lowest average fertilizer application rate and consequently it has the least food productivity. The lack of foreign exchange to import the required amounts of fertilizers is the major reason for the under-utilization of this product. In this context, Fertilizer Aid would go a long way to boosting agriculture production in many countries. In the case of my own country, Zambia, we would very much appreciate offers of this commodity, we are ready to receive and use it profitably. The donors are called upon to seriously consider this request. The return to normal or nearly normal rains in Africa in 1985 and the crea tion of favourable economic conditions which threatened many crops in the region and the food surpluses which have created disposal problems. The average to above average of good harvests with exportable surpluses which were recorded in Africa this year is an encouraging development especially so when one considers the fact that, it is only a year ago when Africa had the worst famine ever. However, without the timely initiative of the Director-General Dr Edouard Saouma who alerted the International Community to the seriousness of the locust and grasshopper plague which had invaded Africa at the time, the a bove mentioned bumper harvests would not have been there. response from the donor community on this problem and their willingness to help fight the invasion was most commendable and very much appreciated. Allow me at this juncture to convey my government's gratitude to FAO and those countries who came to Zambia's aid when the red locusts threatened our survival. As far as we are concerned, the war is not yet over. Now that the rains have come, these pests are likely to multiply and by early next year another havoc is expected. Surveillance equipment and pesticides and other logistics are now required in Zambia to effectively control red locust invasion. As locust and grasshopper infestations respect no national boundaries, regional and sub-regional approach is the only guarantee to the ultimate control and eradication of these pests. Let me turn to the disposal of surplus food. The disposal of the surplus food in some parts of Africa and elsewhere in the developing countries is causing a lot of concern. These surpluses, if not looked after properly, will in the short run depress prices which will in turn become a disincentive to for and world markets. In the majority of developing countries the Firstly, country stocks and secondly it will provide the neighbouring needy country with the right type of food for its people. Where other logistics get into the way of triangular transactions, special programmes and projects should be worked out to get rid of the obstacles. Since not all countries within and between regions have the same type of surpluses and needs, intra-and inter- regional cooperation would minimizing and solving the problem. In other words the solution to the profitable disposal of the occasional surpluses lies in the promotion of regional cooperation in agricultural production and trade. In conclusion, let me state this. Whatever the approach to profitable of occasional surpluses, the most important ingredient for market is the political goodwill among partner countries. It is only through this that the current multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT could be su ccessful. It should be regrettably stressed thatthe to the developing countries. If famine and malnutrition are to be eradicated and world food security attained in each and every country of this planet, then we have to liberalize the world market, we have to do away with export subsidies and protectionism. It is only at this stage that the state of food and agriculture in the world will be bright for all. -35- Kosei SHIOZAWA (Japan): I have listened with special interest to the excellent introduction made by Dr Islam on the current world food and agricultural situation, which the Director-General also touched upon in his opening statement. The document CL 90/2 presents to us a comprehensive illustration of the main features of the world food and agricultural situation. The world food production in 1985 has increased compared to the previous year almost all over the world except for Western Europe. However, the rate of increase against the previous year was 2.1 percent which is less than half that of the previous year, which was 4.7 percent. This change came about from the downfall in the rate of increase for developed countries-that is, from 6.5 percent to 0. the rate of increase for developed countries from 3.0 percent to 3.3 percent. We would like to express a sigh of relief that the food production in Africa has recovered considerably by 7.0 percent since the previous year. We are pleased about the increase in food production in the food deficit developing countries, particularly in the African countries, and we hope this is not just a temporary phenomena due to the good weather, but rather a sign that further steps are being made by the developing countries in order to achieve a sustained food production level for both middle-and long-term arrangements. While there is a clear indication that the critical food situation in Africa is improving, at the same time the problem of locust and grasshopper infestation has' become promptly throughout these efforts made by FAO in trying to mobilize resources and coordinate international assistance are highly appreciated. It goes without saying that the quick response western FAO/ Japanese Government Programme as well as through the cooperation programmes and will continue to make these contributions. We hope to see that FAO continues to play an import ant role in monitoring the infestation during the early stages and coordinating the implementation of the comprehensive measures on a regional scale. The Chernobyl nuclear accident effects in the domestic distribution and consumption in the affected regions, but also the international trade of agricultural and livestock products. In my country a widespread anxiety among consumers concerning the level of contamination of imported foods and domestic milk and other foods had been ovoked. My delegation believes to such accidents future and precise information should be disseminated urgently in case of another accident. Before concluding my statement, I would like to make some brief comments on the useful financial analysis of agricultural development in the developing countries which was described inSection III of this document. A comprehensive analysis of this sort has not been conducted so far despite the fact that it is important to raise the efficiency level of agricultural development and external cooperation relating to it. This analysis is quite useful interesting and highly worthwhile. As it has been indicated in the document, the major resources for agricultural development in the developing countries are the domestic has also been out that the share of the domestic savings among agricultural development resources has been growing since the early 1980s in the deve loping countries and this trend will further continue to advance through the last half of the present decade. We can agree with the idea stated in the document that it is very important to make the best out of the domestic savings as a resource for agricultural development. With regard to the external financial flow for agriculture, the developing countries are expected to pursue measures to maximise effectiveness in the use of the resources. In this connection, my country hopes that the resources available from the counterpart funds which Japan promotes in connection with food aid and aid for food production will be effectively -36- utilized by extend my good wishes to you and wish FAO and its Member Nations success in developing agriculture and providing more and diversified for the people andin eliminating malnutrition, hunger and poverty from our planet. First of all, I would like to thank His Excellency the Director-General for his speech giving much attention to underdeveloped countries. I would like to give some short information about agriculturalland and water reform in Afghanistan. Agriculture as a main production sector is the backbone of the economy of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Around 85 percent of the population of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, directly or indirectly, is engaged in different products contain more than 64 percent of the national income. Around 50 percent of the income from exports is the share of agricultural products which is of great importance from the viewpoint of gaining foreign currency. In 1985, the worth of gross products of agriculture has b een estimated to be around 88 milliard Afghanis in which the share of crop products was about 70 percent, and the remaining 30 was from animal husbandry and products from forestry. Parallel to the share of agriculture sector our animal sectors also contribute the traditional businesses in our rural areas. Our nomads, with a population of around 2.5 million are mostly busy with sheep husbandry since the Karakul sheep is one of our famous breeds and one of the confident sources of Based on these mentioned having in mind that our economic development mostly depends on the agricultural sector, the integrated socio-economic rural development is the priority of our Party and Government's goals. Today, in our country, the policies and economic strategies of development are formulated with the target of rural development. In this connection, I want to point out some of our main achievements in providing technical and economic assistance to our peasants. The implementation of land and water reforms is considered as a basic action and step towards rural development. In our country before the victory of the national and democratic Saur Revolution (April revolution) 35 000 landlord families owned around 28.6 percent of agricultural land, which was more than one million hectares. 11. 5 million farmers were living in rural areas, almost all of them did not ownland, or had only a small area of land. The farmers who were recruited by big landlords owned only 25 percent of the products as their wages, while the farmers were using their old traditional equipment. Therefore land reform was identified as an immediate need. It was cleared and approved by our Revolutionary Council and was implement ed in 1978. The main objectives of implementing land reforms in our Country are pre-feudalistic relations from our socio-ecomomic the living farmers'families; unite the farmers in the up-grading of their social and cultural life. Since the start of the land reform, we have distributed a total of 754 228 hectares ofland to 334 845 landless farmers'families, free of any charges. The process of land reforms has not ended with the completion of land distribution. The Government provides all agricultural machinery, services in different fields of agriculture and animal husbandry to new settlements' and farmers who acquired the land recently. With the assistance of other governmental organizations, rural health centres, schools and other institutions are in the villages. TheGovernmentalso assists the farmers in establishing their own cooperatives. Through these cooperatives, production, marketing and other economic and social affairs of the villagers are managed. Economic and technical assistance from the Government is provided through these cooperatives. We are on the threshold of elimination of illiteracy. Illiterate peasants are not only enrolled in literary courses in their villages, but they are also educated at their farms by literary of irrigation reforms. As recently as 1985, 1 100 hectares of land have been newly cultivated, which show a 22 percent progress over the previous year, 1984. In 1985 sufficient irrigation water has been provided for 750 000 hectares. 72 farmers committees have been established in villages for managing the water distribution to rural areas. Nine governmental offices have been established for irrigation affairs. Also of deep wells have been constructed in range areas. Due to the great importance of land and water reforms in the rehabilitation of our economy our party's Politburo r ecently has that procedures should be adopted for accelerating the process of land and water reforms'all over the country to increase its effectiveness especially in the economic development of rural areas. Unity of farmers, peasants, and cooperatives is a significant progress in our country to ensure satisfactory agricultural development. Before the revolution, the number of registered agricultural cooperatives was only 135 whilst in 1986, we have 472 agricultural cooperatives. These cooperatives not only bring satisfactory benefit to but benef it the farmers by cutting out the middleman from the markets, by stabilizing the prices of agricultural products, and by enabling to receive the products directly from the cooperatives. In order to raise the living standards of farmers, the Government performs all agricultural extension services in the villages. The District Agricultural Extension Units serve the farmer with services, and use machinery and modern agricultural practices. We have planned to establish extension units all over the country. In this connection 100 new extension units have been planned to be established next year, and as a result we need financial resources and foreign assistance. In our country, there are 1.9 million hectares under forest. The main forestry products are timber, fruits such as The fr om forestry products in 1985 has been estimated at about 350 million Afghanis. Our findings in securing the needs of wood for constructionhave led us to intensify the plantation of fast-growing tree species. In 1985 we had considerable achievements in veterinary services. About 10.1 million head of cattle have been treated or vaccinated against animal diseases and 9. 5 million doses of different animal vaccines have been produced. To improve the services to farmers, seeds are sold at. subsidised prices, although price by governmental enterprises) has been raised several times during the last few years. Our country is in a state of undeclared war on imperialism and regional reactionaries. The machinery of this destructive war is fed through the organization of an integrated economic, social and psychological struggle against our hard-working people which is being armed counter-revolutionaries. by the our industrious farmers do not spare in their endeavours in the way of production offoodstuffs for their countrymen. I hope everyone will agree with me that instead of producing all kinds of destructive means, it would work producing products, to contribute to a worldwide struggle hunger and poverty, and to assist agricultural development especially for the under developed countries. In this connection, a review of our Country's production last year would reveal that we had 3.8 million hectares under cultivation of permanent and seasonal crops. This figure shows a hundred percent implementation of the plan and an increase of 4.7 thousand hectares of cultivated land. In accordance with the estimate of the full cultivation campai gn of 1985 and the spring campaign, of this year, 99. 7 percent of the cultivation plan for cereals was under implementation. However, in the current year, in many parts of our country, (especially, in the north) the drought is still prevailing, and we are greatly concerned about this fact. As mentioned, our economy is suffering from the effective undeclared war against our people. Undoubtedly, normally no nation could perform its economic activities alone, and would have to call on the assistance of one of its powerful friendly countries. In this connection, we appreciate the impartial brotherhood and internationalist economic and technical assistance of the Soviet Union in our agricultural affairs. Every year, the Soviet Union grants a great amount of chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, veterinary drugs, and chemicals for the control of the desert, locust. In addition to that, the Soviet Union assists us in establishing and equipping agricultural mechanisation centres, and laboratories, in insemination in and equipping modern agricultural farms. A number of on-going United Nations' agricultural development projects are operationalbecause of the cooperation of FAOwith our country. The output of these fruitful projects has an effect on our agricultural development. In this connection, on behalf of our people and my delegation I want to thank FAO, especially Dr Saouma, the Director- General, for its cooperation in maintaining our agricultural development every year. In the meantime, I also request the technical divisions concerned in FAO to kindly approve those pipeline which are requested by our Government for UNDP's assistance. The meeting rose 17. 30 hours .

Elecci\u00f3n de tres Vicepresidentes y nombramiento del Presidente y de los Miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n (continuaci\u00f3n) LE PRESIDENT: Mesdames, Mesdemoiselles, Messieurs, nous d\u00e9clarons et par le parach\u00e8vement y des sur ce point pr\u00e9cis? Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Mexico): M\u00e1s que para proponer y resolver los asuntos pendientes de la Mesa es para hacer una reflexi\u00f3n en este Consejo y para exhortar a las diversas regiones a que lo consideren. Se\u00f1or Presidente, ha sido tradici\u00f3n en el Consejo que el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n tenga cuanto m\u00e1s doce miembros y en ciertas ocasiones ha llegado hasta trece miembros. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, y por lo que ley\u00f3 usted el d\u00eda de ayer, inclusive ciertas informaciones un tanto ambiguas que recibimos ayer mismo por la noche, el n\u00famero del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n parece expandirse hasta quince, es decir un tercio o casi un tercio de lo que es nuestro Consejo. En tal caso, el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n es ya pr\u00e1cticamente un grupo de negociaci\u00f3n y no un Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n m\u00e1s, y como Presidente de tal Comit\u00e9 me par ece que un numero tan grande de miembros lo har\u00eda francamente inmanejable y por tanto poco efectivo. Se\u00f1or Presidente, a estas alturas solicito a las diversas regiones que se atengan al n\u00famero que tradicionalmente ha integrado el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y que s\u00e9 reconsidere, lo repito, que se reconsidere la membrec\u00eda del mismo con el prop\u00f3sito de establecerlo en doce miembros, o en caso de que no se pueda evitar en trece miembros. LE PRESIDENT: La liste des pays porte sur 14 qui NEVES (Brazil): I quite agree with what has been said by the Ambassador of Mexico. In fact we are all aware that we are here in order to try to deal with a serious crisis. My feeling is that such a large and unorthodox drafting committee is not going to help matters. In fact we are almost facing a Sub-committee of the Whole. In this connection I would like to endorse the views advanced by the Ambassador of Mexico and suggest that the Council refers this matter back to the regions and that we then try to see if we can make something more orthodox and in accordance with tradition and not a negotiating committee. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Deseamos asociarnos con la inquietud que han planteado los delegados de M\u00e9xico y Brasil. Particularmente la delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico presidir\u00e1 el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y, por lo tanto, son leg\u00edtimas y justificadas las preocupaciones de que en un Consejo tan importante como \u00e9ste un Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n muy amplio, con gran n\u00famero de miembros, dificultar\u00e1 m\u00e1s bien los trabajos del mismo. Por lo tanto, nosotros apoyamos las propuestas hechas por M\u00e9xico y Brasil de que el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n de este Consejo quede en doce miembros como se ha hecho en el pasado y tradicionalmente. -41- Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia espera que no habr\u00e1 ninguna dificultad en que se logre lo que ha propuesto el colega de M\u00e9xico. Los informes de los \u00faltimos cinco periodos de sesiones demuestran claramente, y esto es f\u00e1cil de confirmar, que la tradicional composici\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n ha sido la siguiente:Dos miembros por cada una de las cuatro regiones de pa\u00edses en desarrollo, o sea Africa, Asia, Medio Oriente y Am\u00e9rica Latina y El Caribe; dos miembros por Europa occidental, y a veces, y esto es muy justo, un miembro por Europa oriental; un miembro por Am\u00e9rica del Norte y un miembro desarrollado por Asia y el Pac\u00edfico. Esto es lo que ha sucedido en las reuniones del Consejo y a ese patr\u00f3n es al que debe ce\u00f1irse la composici\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Por lo tanto, yo creo que no es n ecesario prolongar este debate, sino que, a la luz de lo que hemos hecho siempre, los representantes de las regiones informen a usted sus respectivos candidatos. Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo): Effectivement, nous sommes ici d\u00e9passons, nous n'avons jamais d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le le Pr\u00e9sident, au niveau pour cette raison que nous membres s'est brutalement au cours \u00eatre une raison valable pour faire en sorte que le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction soit le plus large possible. Nous savons tous que plus ce comit\u00e9 est large, plus ses peuvent se le Pr\u00e9sident de ce de r\u00e9daction pour que le nombre soit r\u00e9duit au nombre crois que vient composition Khalil M AKKAWI (Lebanon ): I should like to take the floor to support fully what has been said by the distinguished representative of Mexico, as Chairman of this Drafting Committee. Lebanon is a member of this Drafting Committee and from experience shares the views which have been put forward by all the distinguished delegates who have preceded me. For this reason I s upport fully what has been said by the distinguished representatives, in particular, the specific proposals made by His Excellency Ambassador of Colombia. Il le Comit\u00e9 de 14 \u00e0 12, en essayant de respecter, autant pour le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction et ceci dans le but de fac iliter la cadre des diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9gions FAO de faire les propositions au secr\u00e9tariat aussitet que possible? Sra. Mercedes FERM\u00cdN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Solamente quiero responder a su pregunta de si esta propuesta tiene apoyo, y Venezuela dice que apoya la proposici\u00f3n del embajador de M\u00e9xico, Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, y especialmente aclarar la representaci\u00f3n por regiones. Jacques POSIER (France): Je voudrais simplement nombre total candidats composition du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction? -42- Les nombres par r\u00e9gion sont: 2 pour l'Afrique, 2 pour l'Asie, 2 pour le Proche-Orient, 2 pour latine et 6 pour composition Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. Voici est par le secr\u00e9tariat. chaque r\u00e9gion en d\u00e9veloppement. 8.

Jacques POSIER (France): En parvenu nouveau sur la question pour faire un nombre total de candidatures d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la Colombie: 2 pour l'Afrique, 2 pour le Proche-Orient, 2 pour l'Am\u00e9rique latine, 2 pour l'Asie, 2 pour l'Europe occidentale, 2 pour l'Europe orientale, 1 pour l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, 1 pour l'Asie et le Pacifique d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s. Ceci est la proposition de la Colombie. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Mexico): Se\u00f1or Presidente, que a nadie le sorprenda que yo haya levantado esta cuesti\u00f3n, las razones son obvias. Esta es una ocasi\u00f3n extraordinaria donde el Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n propone que tenga 15 miembros. Tradicionalmente-y eso se puede revisar caso por caso-la distribuci\u00f3n ha sido como la que ha se\u00f1alado el distinguido delegado de Colombia y en la mayor parte de las veces el Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n no ha tenido m\u00e1s de 12 miembros, se ha limitado a 12 miembros, . y, en ciertas ocasiones excepcionales, asl es, cuando por razones de inter\u00e9s para Europa Oriental se ha visionado con un miembro de esa regi\u00f3n, de manera que monta a 13. Y para contestar directamente al distinguido delegado de Francia, no solamente la propuesta que hemos hecho sino la tradici\u00f3n, la forma de resolver la integraci\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n implica que Europa debe limitarse a dos miembros y Am\u00e9rica del Norte a un miembro. Esas son las dos regiones que deben limitar su membrec\u00eda en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. LE PRESIDENT: Nous sommes saisis de propositions pr\u00e9cises de la la Est-ce que cette proposition base pour du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction? Si tel le cas, je propose que cette proposition de repr\u00e9sentatif de l'ensemble des r\u00e9gions pour ce Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. Nous passons maintenant au second point sur l'\u00e9lection du troisi\u00e8me (Bangladesh): I have great pleasure in proposing the name of His Excellency Paul Bomani, Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Development of Tanzania, for the third post of Vice-Chairman of the Council. Mr Bomani is already quite well known for his dynamic role and long experience in the various committees of FAO and other United Nations Organizations. I feel that his inclusion in the bureau will be of very great help and assistance for the success of the Council. Joseph CHICAYA (Congo): M. Paul Bomani, Ministre de l'agriculture et du d\u00e9veloppement et de candidature. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Es simplemente para dar el apoyo de Venezuela a la candidatura propuesta. -43- LE PRESIDENT: Vice-Pr\u00e9sident notre Conseil.

I extend our compliments to the members of your bureau who have been elected to assist you. -45- On behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf I wish to extend my congratulations to the Director-General for his comprehensive appraisal of the world food and agriculture situation in his opening statement, and to Professor Islam for his excellent introduction of this agenda item. Going through the documents before us, it is clear that world trade in agriculture has stagnated; but the situation in developing countries is countries. We learn from the documents before us that preliminar y estimates for 1986 indicate a minor increase in world agriculture production of 0.8 percent as a net result of 1.5 percent growth in food production. While food output growth in developing countries in 1986 is reported to be of the order of 3. 3 percent, the growth in Africa is reported to be only 1. 1 percent compared to the 7 percent increase achieved in is a very the fact that the region's of growth is more than 3 percent a year and is coupled with a rapid urbanization rate. Political awareness and concern for the disturbing, deterioration in the performance of the agricultural sector in Africa has been at the focus of the African leaders. The Lagos Plan of Action (1980), the Harare Declaration (1984) and the Addis Ababa Declaration last year, which was a precursor to the UN Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development, are all clear manifestations of the commitment of the African deteriorating food situation from getting for internal reforms to guarantee priority to the introduced policy reforms \"African Agriculture: The Next 25 Years\" presented to the FAO Regional Conference for Africa, September 1986 gave a clear analysis of the causes of retarded agricultural growth. We shall not dwell on it at this point, as the Council will have an opportunity to discuss it under Agenda item 8, 2. Nevertheless, we would like here to reiterate our endorsement of the four-point programme of action for Africa's agricultural progress as proposed by FAO (CL 90/2 Sup. 1 para. 28). Mr Chairman, we welcome the second replenishment of IFAD. Although the target has fallen short of what was required, we feel it is a very positive trend. Regarding fertilizers we believe that fertilizers along with improved seeds and water are indispensable inputs in bringing about increased productivity and food production to enable countries to become more food self-reliant. We therefore welcome 'temporary' fall in prices of fertilizers, we hope prices will not go up in symphathy with oil prices which will be now going up any moment. The resurgence of locusts and grasshoppers in West Africa and of migrating locusts of all species in Africa are a great concern at a time when we are struggling to become food self-reliant. We welcome the establishment of the Emergency Centre for Locust Operations created to help mobilize funds and equipment and coordinate action. We thank FAO and the international community for assistance in effecting control campaigns. We request phase tapering off, mechanisms should be protection Organisations both financially and materially to enable them to cope with future invasions of this nature. This will ensure a more lasting solution. In this connection the Ugandan Delegation would like to propose that the Council pass resolution concerning those matters. Regarding forestry in developing countries the that fuel wood accounted for more than 66 percent of the total energy consumption in a sample of 24 tropical countries, is an indication of the need to pay more attention to forestry conservation and afforestation programmes. There need explore other sources of renewable energy. We are encouraged to note that there is an increasing tendency tropical logs for export. Finally, I would like to thank the FAO for the work it is doing to promote increased food production and the international community they have offered in implementing Africa's Programme for Economic Recovery and (Germany, Federal Republic of): My delegation welcomes the presentation of this year's Report on the State of Food and Agriculture, document CL 90/2 which contains in a clear form a wealth of data and facts. As last year the report starts with an examination of the current world economic situation, paras. 1 to 23\u00b7 We especially welcome the fact that growth in food production in the developing regions in 1985 was even more spread than in previous years, para. 24\u00b7 In contrast to paras 33 and 34 of the document CL 90/2, the Federal Republic of Germany during the previous the share of which now amounts to more than 30 percent of our total economic cooperation with developing countries. With regard to the international agricultural trade, paras. 36 to 42, we welcome the results of the Ministerial Meeting at Punta del Este for the preparation of the forthcoming GATT negotiations. Moreover, agricultural in paras. 123-127 of the document CL 90/2. In this regard we welcome the improvements in the African situation, especially the publication of the up-to-date situation report on Africa mentioned in para. 127. In this connection, allow me to stress that we would welcome a new edition of FAO's publication \"African Agriculture: The Next 25 Years\", which had been published on the occasion of the last Regional Conference for Africa. I refer to the representative of the Commission of the European Economic Community who will express the Community's view with regard to paras. 192-195. We gladly notice that according to para 4 of document CL 90/2-Sup. 1, inflation rates continue to recede and nominal interest rates are at lowest level since the early 1980's. The documents stressed to large extent the problem of indebtedness of developing countries. The Federal of ease the difficulties which developing of very Recently my country, in fact, has wr itten off a total of DM 4.2 billion of debt coming from official development cooperation to a number of developing countries with a low gross national product. With this very high amount, allow me to say that the Federal Republic of Germany is on top of all developed countries. My delegation shares the view expressed in the Report that world economic difficulties have not yet been eliminated. Many world economic indicators, meanwhile countries. We welcome these signals and we are convinced that the international community can tackle now, with greater confidence, the tasks than it could last year. LE PRESIDENT: Lawrence I would like to say that Australia finds the Report on the State of Food and Agriculture a very useful document for the information it provides and we are thinking carefully about the issues it raises and the policies that will be needed to address them. I was interested to note the Director-General's remarks yesterday about the problems which Third World producers are facing in the present situation of world surpluses of some major agricultural products, especially This problem which is particularly difficult also for countrieslike Australia which is a low cost producer of those products and the income of our farmers has dropped dramatically this year as a result of low world market prices for these products. Australia feels very strongly that an essential part of any solution to the problems of agricultural development in developing countries is effective reform of the world market system for agricultural products. The key factor in this regard is the need to address the role played by domestic a situation where world prices are more responsive to the underlying forces of under conditions at the present time. In this context, I would like to emphasise the importance, in our view, of the outcome of the GATT meeting at Punta del Este in September 1986 to launch the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations-As the Director-General pointed out yesterday, and a number indicated, this the Contracting Parties agreed, for the first time, to hold substantive negotiations on agriculture. There has been agreement to look at the real causes of the agricultural trade problem by holding substantive negotiations on all direct and indirect subsidies and other measures affecting agricultural production and trade. The Australian Government has already devoted considerable effort major producting continuing representations and dialogue for some time, both within GATT and directly with key producing and consuming nations. It is pleasing to note that there are fundamental pressures in all these countries for change and that we may hope that this will lead to real efforts to wind back the use of subsidies that distort agricultural production and trade. Australia has been very active in this regard and played a key role in the establishment of the Cairns group of fair traders. This particular initiative played an important role in the Punta del Este meeting and the coalition of interests represented developing countries) should continue to be an active force as the negotiations get under way in earnest. In particular, this group has provided a focus for countries which are competitive producers and traders of agricultural products countries whose been largely responsible problem, or which need to consider some opening up of their markets for imports of agricultural products, namely the United States, the EEC and Japan. Australia acknowledges that the agreement in Uruguay is only the beginning and that real changes may take some time to achieve. As indicated earlier, we feel that achieving meaningful reforms must be tackled in a multilateral framework and I am heartened to hear the widespread conviction, as expressed by many speakers at this meeting, that the impetus of these negotiations must be maintained. The process of agricultural trade liberalization will not be painless, for developing countries as much as for developed countries, and we trust that these expressions of support will be carried through to the multilateral trade negotiations themselves. I would note in passing, that document CL 90/2 does not accurately summarize the results of the Punta del Este meeting, referred to in paragraph 40. This is understandably because it was drafted, I presume, before that meeting but I think It is important that the report of this session of the Council makes appropriate reference to the very was also pleased to note, in the Director-General's speech, that FAO w ill be doing what it can to assist the GATT negotiations to be successful in relation to agriculture by providing assistance in the form of information and statistics. Australia feels strongly that multilateral institutions, such as FAO, must play a vital part in solving these, problems and to do this they must be as efficient and flexible as possible in their operations. In this context I would like to mention a general principle that Australia feels is most important; namely that Heads of major international and national organizations including UN Specialized Agencies be limited to a maximum of two terms in office. Australia is firmly committed to the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies, including FAO. Where appropriate, however, we have been critical of inefficiency and ineffectiveness. We have consistently argued the need for periodic re-invigoration of the UN family. The central element of this re-invigoration must be leadership. Large Institutions benefit from re-assessment and periodic injections of enthusiasm and new ideas and need dynamism in its senior management and regular changes in leadership to combat rigidity and encourage leaders to within a corporate team make more responsive to current needs. Australia supports the two-term principle in a wide variety of situations and takes the view that the two-term principle is as applicable to FAO as to other institutions. Lastly, I would like to emphasize that we should forget the referred in paragraphs 72 to 79 of document CL 90/2 and I would underline that development of fisheries, particularly the area aquaculture, should be taken into account in any discussion of the world food situation. In this way FAO's own assessment (made at the World Conference on Fisheries and Management and Development in 1984) of the contribution of fisheries to food supplies and LE remercie le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de communication. me permettrai cependant de noter que, dans sa d\u00e9claration, il une question qui ne figure pas l'ordre doit s'Ouvrir sur ce point hier. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): No quise interrumpir al distinguido delegado de Australia cuando introdujo un tema que no estaba en el orden del d\u00eda. Este tipo de actos, se\u00f1or Presidente, creo que dificultan los trabajos de un Consejo que no est\u00e1 deliberando sobre cuestiones que se tratar\u00e1n mucho m\u00e1s adelante, el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o. No comamos ansias, ya que esto solamente complica nuestros trabajos, esto es irregular y, como bien ha se\u00f1alado usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, no se puede incluir en nuestros trabajos. No provoquemos, facilitemos, y si tanto se respeta y se quiere en estos organismos internacionales, como se ha declarado una y otra vez, una soluci\u00f3n para los problemas de la humanidad, no metamos asuntos que solamente vienen a deteriorar la atm\u00f3sfera, ya dif\u00edcil, por las graves implicaciones financieras que ahora enfrentamos. Esperamos cordialidad de parte de todos los miembros, sensatez y, sobre todo, se\u00f1or Presidente, apoyamos su declaraci\u00f3n y esperamos que no se nos complique la vida en el futuro inmediato. Jacques POSIER cette session du Conseil; 2) Les statuts de la FAO ne pr\u00e9voient pas la limitation du nombre des mandats du Directeur \u00e0 n'est pas comp\u00e9tent pour le faire. 3) Je consid\u00e8re initiative est inopportune et re\u00e7u un ordre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de l'Australie sur la dur\u00e9e du mandat des chefs des agences des Nations Unies et, tout particuli\u00e8rement pour ce la nous pr\u00e9senter ici \u00e0 cette session recevoir des instructions de la part de notre gouvernement. Or, en l'absence de ces instructions, figure dans notre rapport sur ce sujet. Point of order Point d'ordre Punto de orden Sra. Mercedes FERMIN COMEZ (Venezuela): Simplemente voy a decir que \u00e9sta es una moci\u00f3n de orden; yo no creo que puede haber lugar siquiera para comenzar a intervenir sobre el contenido de la sugerencia del delegado de Australia. Los oradores que me han precedido en el uso de la palabra est\u00e1n perfectamente de acuerdo con la opini\u00f3n de Francia, pienso que no debe haber lugar ni siquiera para continuar interviniendo en el asunto y que, por consiguiente, el se\u00f1or Presidente con todo respeto debe declarar eso fuera de orden puesto que no est\u00e1 en la agenda. Es mi proposici\u00f3n. -49- LE PRESIDENT: D'autres Conseil est d'accord pour consid\u00e9rer ce point est un et je souhaite vivement, compte nos de leur importance pour la vie de l'Organisation et de notre mission \u00e0 accomplir ici, que notre soit simplifi\u00e9e et fasse dans last comments give me some difficulty because ray instructions from Ottawa are very clear on this point: that is I have very clear instructions that at some time during the Council meeting the Canadian delegation should endorse the two term principle as well. Where do you think it would be best for us to make that declaration? LE PRESIDENT: Nous vous remercions de votre intervention. a une question de proc\u00e9dure l\u00e9gale; nous sommes une organisation le respect de la proc\u00e9dure et du r\u00e8glement. Je ne suis pas disponible pour travailler dans des conditions qui ne respectent pas la r\u00e9glementation et le r\u00e8glement de la FAO, sorte vous appartient de trouver une formulation qui aille dans le sens du r\u00e8glement de la FAO. Je reviens au point d'ordre. Le a retenu (Australia): I just wanted some clarification. I raised a matter in my intervention, as I was instructed to do. That particular intervention merely raised a point that Australia still feels strongly about in the context of how international organizations such as FAO may play a part in the very serious problems of food and agriculture facing us. Now, as I understand it, you are saying that it is ruled out of order, that intervention can be referred to in any way so that other delegations may raise that matter. Now I am quite new to FAO and I am not familiar with the legal aspects, but delegations raise all sorts of issues, many of which we may not agree with, and I find it a little puzzling that a point of that nature can be ruled out of order only in the sense of a general intervention and nothing else, and I would like some clarification please. Ronald F. R. DEARE (United Kingdom): I share some of the puzzlement of ray colleague from Australia because my understanding is that he was not suggesting that the question he raised should be debated. made on of his authorities of an opinion which held. I gather that the delegate of Canada would wish to do the same thing, and I might add that we would wish to touch on the subject, but simply in a factual way in our statement, not to introduce it for debate under this item. We accept that it is not a subject for debate under this item, but we are representatives of sovereign countries and I assume that we are free to make our statement and have it recorded in the report of the Council in the same way as any other statements are recorded. So I would appreciate your guidance on that point. LE PRESIDENT: Je crois que nous avons pris note de ce qui vient d'\u00eatre dit. Il toute Je le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 pour avoir inform\u00e9 le Conseil sur un point de vue, un pr\u00e9cis. La seule chose qui me g\u00eane personnellement c'est que ce point ne figurant pas dans le rapport du Conseil \u00e9t\u00e9 pouvons point vue l\u00e9gitime de pays tels que le Royaume-Uni, Nous question n'est Nous en raison de ces interventions de derni\u00e8re minute. Je sais que Guillermo Enrique GONZALEZ (Argentina): Mi delegaci\u00f3n hab\u00eda solicitado la palabra sobre el punto de orden que hab\u00eda presentado la Embajadora de Venezuela. Consideramos que \u00e9se era el procedimiento m\u00e1s adecuado frente a un comentario que mi delegaci\u00f3n, con todo respeto, considera inadecuado, inapropiado, para la discusi\u00f3n del tema 4 de nuestra agenda. En todo caso nos encontramos ahora en una situaci\u00f3n parad\u00f3jica porque si aquellas delegaciones que no coincidimos con esas tres representaciones que nos han hecho conocer su parecer en la ma\u00f1ana de hoy sobre un tema que no hace a la cuesti\u00f3n que estamos debatiendo, nos encontrar\u00edamos en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y posteriormente en este plenario con una gran duda: esas delegaciones han hecho, efectivamente, sus declaraciones; otras delegaciones no han expresado un punto de vista contrario y entonces cuando la Secretar\u00eda deba informar cu\u00e1ntas delegaciones hablaron a favor y cu\u00e1ntas lo hicieron en contra nos encontraremos en que un grupo mayoritario de delegaciones habl\u00f3 sobre este tema que est\u00e1 fuera de orden; por lo tanto, se\u00f1or Presidente, con todo respeto, yo creo que debemos volver a la moci\u00f3n de orden de Venezuela en el sentido de declarar fuera de orden, esta cuesti\u00f3n, de lo contrario, comenzaremos un nuevo debate en el que estoy seguro todos los miembros de este Consejo vamos a referirnos con toda tranquilidad y con la extensi\u00f3n que se quiera a este tema. Igor KIPMAN (Brazil): Very briefly, I would like to say that my delegation endorses the preposition made by the delegate of Venezuela which was supported by Argentina. Chavaly SRINIVASA SASTRY (India): Like the delegate of Australia, I am also a first-timer to the FAO Council. I have four submissions to make. As far as my comprehension would seem to guide me, the suggestion that has been made by the delegate of Australia has no direct or cognate relationship with the agenda item which the Council is now discussing, which is entitled \"State of Food and Agriculture 1986\". The second submission which I would make is that the procedure, discussions, deliberations, resolutions and decisions of by well laid out rules, procedures and and we have to respect these rules and conventions when we make any suggestions or proposals which have some significant impact on the functioning of the Organization. Thirdly, should you at this time make a departure from the well-established procedures, with due respect to you I would submit that it would be open to all of us during the rest of the Council Session to raise a number of issues which might or might subjects which are carefully chosen to be placed on the agenda and in support of which elaborate documentation has been tabled. I would therefore submit with due respect that I agree entirely with the point of view very cogently and legitimately argued by the delegate of France and I would submit that the proposal by Australia be ruled out of order. LE PRESIDENT: Nous avons une proposition de point d'ordre. Le point d'ordre est le suivant: on nous propose de ne pas discuter de cette que sont en faveur de que Conseil a admis \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 la motion pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Venezuela. K. Robin HIGHAM (Canada): I believe two delegates are permitted according to the text of the Organization to speak against a proposition before it is voted on. We have already cast the vote. My point is that you should have invited delegates to speak for and against the proposal before was voted -51- the question of a point of order is Rule XII paragraph 20 of the General Rules of the Organization, and I will read it slowly: \"During the discussion of any matter, a delegate or representative may rise to a point of order and the point of order shall be immediately decided by the Chairman.\" That is the first sentence, and it is my understanding that the Chairman took decision. may appeal against Chairman, in which event the appeal shall inmmediately be put to ruling shall stand unless cast. A delegate or representative rising to a point of order may not speak on the substance of the matter under discussion. \" My interpretation is that the Chairman of the Council ruled that he considered that the subject that had been raised was out of order. Some delegates, including I believe the delegate of Australia, objected to this ruling. A vote was then taken and the ruling of the Chairman was upheld. Therefore I think that is where the matter ends. K. Robin HIGHAM (Canada): I am sorry to pursue this so far but could I ask for clarification. Have we a ruling that the subject is out of order for the whole Council Session or for the debate under this agenda item, because we have two agenda items where it would seem to me to be most appropriate: 16.1, appointment of the Director-General, and 19, Any other Business. I think your ruling, if I understand it correctly, is that we are out of order for this agenda item, but I would appreciate your clarification. LEGAL COUNSEL: The basic ruling was clearly that the matter was out of order under this particular agenda item. But it is also implicit that it was out of order because it was a matter that was not on the agenda. If the matter is to be added to the agenda there is a perfectly clear rule, under Rule XXV, paragraph 7 (c) the Council may in the course of its session include a new item by a vote of two thirds of its membership. If the delegate of Canada, or any other delegate concerned, wishes to the matter again under \"Any other Business\" the question will have to be decided at that time, and may or may not be decided in exactly the same way. However, I should specific observation on the item \"Any other Business\". In view of the fact that there is a very clear rule governing the addition of items in the course of a Council Session, it is equally clear that \"Any other Business\" is not a \"hold-all\" under which a delegate may raise any particular item that comes to mind. It is generally used for formalities such as votes of thanks, or expressions of sympathy to a country which has suffered some natural disaster. It is not an item under which Members of the Council may raise entirely new and eminently substantive items. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Se\u00f1or Presidente, la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia estaba en primer lugar entre la lista de oradores que usted ley\u00f3. Comprendemos muy bien que el curso del debate no le haya podido permitir a usted concedernos la palabra, pero no podemos permanecer en silencio porque consideramos inoportuno y desafortunado el hecho de que, durante la discusi\u00f3n de un tema que interesa esencialmente al Tercer Mundo, se haya provocado discordia, con intenciones que preferimos no calificar. El delegado de Australia se refiri\u00f3 a la eficiencia y capacidad de los jefes de los organismos internacionales. Nosotros no podemos aceptar esa insinuaci\u00f3n sibilina. El Gobierno de Colombia se ha reiterado una vez m\u00e1s en la admiraci\u00f3n que siente por la excelente administraci\u00f3n del Doctor Edouard Saouma como Director General de la FAO por la inteligencia, la capacidad y la consagraci\u00f3n con que \u00e9l cumple sus altas responsabilidades. Quisi\u00e9ramos rogarles a los colegas de Australia, Canad\u00e1 y Reino Unido, que no nos sigan perturbando, que nos permitan continuar la discusi\u00f3n de este tema. Afif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of) (original language Arabic): I have listened to this lengthy discussion with great patience. I should to say that my delegation feels a certain bitterness and sadness at what the Delegate of Australia has just said. He knows very well that his statement was going to lead to the atmosphere we have now, an atmosphere which we should avoid in order to maintain the respect due to our Council. We have come here to consider and to face very serious responsibilities, responsabilities which to us this discussion is rather out of place. In fact, what was said by our colleague has no bearing on any agenda item. We consider that the statement tends to disrupt the smooth running of our Council and distracts its attention from the acute and major problems which we have to face. Our delegation categorically rejects discussion on this matter under this agenda item (or under any other item) and we believe that the very fact it has been raised, is out of order. We cannot accept it. However, we must say that we support all the proposals which have been made particularly those put forward by France and Venezuela. Finally, I should like to say that we cannot forget the great achievements of the Director-General, Dr. Saouma, which have been of particular benefit to developing countries and have provided them with the necessary aid for their agricultural development. We should also not forget the achievements within the administration itself and the smooth running of the Organization. We owe him a great deal of respect and admiration. I believe that our Council should have made a statement thanking the Director-General for statement which raises unnecessary problems from all points of view. I would like to finish with this item as soon as possible and continue to deal with the items which are on our agenda. Horacio, CARANDANG (Ph ilipines): I should like to congratulate you, Mr Chairman on the way you have handled this matter. I think your decision is, just. As any civilized gathering of human beings we are governed by rules, which are very clear. If it is not an agenda item we cannot discuss it. It takes thirty days before anybody can request the Director-General to circulate the matter, or, during the Session one needs a two-thirds vote in order to insert an agenda item. This has not been complied with so the matter cannot be discussed. I concur with your decision. I congratulate you on your wisdom and precision, and do not think the item can be included in the report. devons du point 4. En effet, notre ordre du jour est charg\u00e9; je voudrais que nous passions au point 4, que pour pouvoir la crise alimentaire et des points soumis \u00e0 notre point du jour. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Se\u00f1or Presidente, disc\u00falpeme por utilizar la moci\u00f3n de orden, pero considero que debo usarla porque de otra manera usted me iba a cerrar el punto. Ahora, yo quiero expresar no s\u00f3lo la sorpresa porque estamos perdiendo un tiempo necesario y precioso para la discusi\u00f3n de lo que est\u00e1bamos realmente profundizando, sino tambi\u00e9n quiero expresar que, si hay instrucciones de gobierno,-todos los que estamos aqu\u00ed sentados tenemos instrucciones de gobierno-, yo tambi\u00e9n tengo instrucciones de gobierno para no excluir la posibilidad de reel ecci\u00f3n del Director General y puede pasar tambi\u00e9n que en estos momentos en que las dificultades financieras hacen necesario tener al frente a una personalidad decidida, yo tambi\u00e9n puedo dar argumentos y puedo hablar tambi\u00e9n de que si la FAO no ha hecho m\u00e1s es por los mecanismos financieros que le han restado y porque estamos sometidos a un crecimiento cero desde hace siete a\u00f1os. Pod\u00edamos hablar de esto mucho; por lo tanto, yo le pido disculpas, pero quer\u00eda expresar que no debemos entrar en esta discusi\u00f3n, pero que no se nos ponga como condici\u00f3n el que durante el Consejo no lo podamos hacer, porque nosotros tenemos instrucciones de hacerlo tambi\u00e9n. Ivan TONEV (Bulgaria): Probably this is an explanation after the I shall be very brief. My delegation supported the motion raised the delegate Venezuela and also the explanations given by the delegates of France, Colombia and others. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Lamento intervenir, se\u00f1or Presidente, puesto que comparto la opini\u00f3n de que tal vez tomamos mucho tiempo en esta cuesti\u00f3n que ha perturbado nuestros trabajos de esta ma\u00f1ana. Sin embargo, como usted recordar\u00e1, Nicaragua estaba tambi\u00e9n en la lista de oradores original que usted ten\u00eda antes de que Venezuela hiciera el punto de orden sobre un punto de orden anterior. Ese punto hab\u00eda sido apoyado por Argentina, que fue ya votado con el resultado que ya conocen. No obstante, yo no pod\u00eda pasar como delegado de Nicaragua esta oportunidad dado que aqu\u00ed, y con todo respeto debo mencionarlo, tres delegados de pa\u00edses desarrollados pr\u00e1cticamente han introducido un tema provocatorio en este Consejo que no estaba relacionado con el tema 4 del documento 2 del trabajo de este Consejo. -53- Deseo simplemente mencionar lo que ya he hecho, digamos, en grupos regionales y en el grupo de los 77. Nicaragua, nuestras m\u00e1s altas autoridades, han dado ya un apoyo espec\u00edfico y oficial al se\u00f1or Director General Edouard Saouma para su reelecci\u00f3n para un tercer mandato como Director de esta Organizaci\u00f3n. Por lo tanto es una obligaci\u00f3n de parte m\u00eda como representante de mi pa\u00eds reconocer la autoridad que tiene el Director General en cuanto a la conducci\u00f3n que ha tenido, din\u00e1mica, sabia y efectiva. En este sentido deseo reiterar que lamento haber tenido que prolongar las deliberaciones, pero era para m\u00ed un deber motivado por las intervenciones que han hecho representantes de pa\u00edses amigos y colegas de trabajo. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): I have tried a few times to get the floor to discuss the matter which has been raised, but I was not successful in catching your eye. I had thought that by the solution of the point of order we could settle the matter, but since the discussion has continued on the subject I should like also to express the surprise of my delegation and to deplore that some delegations have injected a totally alien subject into the useful and constructive debate which we have had so far on the food and agriculture situation in the world. This provoked reactions from many delegations, and I consider it was really unnecessary and is to be deplored. I would say that my delegation would not accept at any time during this Council a debate on the proposal to consider the subject proposed by the representative of Australia because we do not think there are good reasons for this, especially bearing in mind that even in his statement he said we have to apply the principle prevailing in the United Nations to have a limit of two terms. I do not know In which organizations this rule is implemented. I could mention at least four specialized agencies and other organizations where the executives are from developed countries and where they have three or more terms in office. I am not going to discuss the subject of efficiency or non-efficiency, but I would say from my own experience and I have been in touch with this Organization for at least 12 years, since the time of the World Food Conference which was called because of the. difficulties and inefficiencies in FAO-that since Mr Saouma has taken office in this Organization there has been much improvement, and I think his best work has been done in this Organization, particularly during the last food crisis and especially concerning the situation in Africa. LE PRESIDENT: Je de la Yougoslavie. J'esp\u00e8re d\u00e9bat termin\u00e9 et que discussion du point 4 du jour. A. K. M. Kamaluddin CHOUDHURY (Bangladesh): Mr Ch airman, let me begin by Dr Islam for presenting an excellent document containing detailed information on the current state of food and agriculture. In his report, Dr Islam raised a number of important issues like the decline in the level of external assistance for agricultural development, the continuing fall in commodity prices and consequential deterioration developing countries. generally endorses the report, but in certain areas we have a few comments to make. The world food and agriculture situation today is characterized by a paradox of ample a a Africa. Although recent years the availab ility of food has improved due higher production and larger imports, for many developing countries there has been a decline in the nutritional standard, which is highly disappointing. The document itself points out that the per capita calorie intake has declined in 46 countries out of 102 developing countries. That is a matter of great concern because the sharpest losses in calorie intake have been countries of DES. Poverty, hunger and malnutrition continue to be the most critical problems faced by the world community. The report on the State of Food and Agriculture reinforces our view that agricultural development, particularly production of food grains, is of the utmost importance for the low-income developing -54- countries. Development of agriculture is of vital importance for the economic suryivial of the LDCs, but cannot release funds or resources for investment in agricultural development. Therefore, they ar e still in need of support from the developed countries who are in a more fortunate situation. are needed to suppl as seeds and fertilizers, to achieve increased production and to achieve food security for these nations. Therefore, resources are needed for agricultural development in the LDCs. We note with great concern that the level of multilateral assistance and bilateral assistance for agricultural development is going down. This trend of declining assistance has to be arrested to improve the countries, step up their level of assistance for multilateral agencies like IFAD and for funding development projects in the food and agriculture sector. This will help in the better utilization of land and in improving the level of productivity. K. Robin HIGH\u00c0M (Canada): In his preparation and presentation of the document, Dr. Islam has delivered nothing less than the excellence we have come to expect from him and his staff, and for that we thank him. We have a small technical amendment to propose for paragraph 200 concerning Canada, but my delegation will pass that directly to the secretariat. This morning I should like to respond to the paper on three levels: first, the prospects for international trade in agriculture; secondly, resources for development assistance; thirdly, the challenge before FAO. Concerning prospects for international agriculture trade, removing restrictions to a further liberalization of world trade is, for Canada, a vital element in ensuring economic growth for all countries, I believe. Canada views the successful launch of the new multilateral trade negotiations as an important and positive element in the outlook for international trade in agriculture. Our common efforts and success at Punta del Este forged a new sense of cooperation among trading nations. Canada will be working hard, together with both developed and developing countries, to achieve these common objectives. Of particular concern to us is the deteriorating agriculture trade situation which is plagued by structural surpluses and by massive trade distortions through and subsidies. It is multilateral trade negotiations must reform the rules for agricultural trade and bring them under a discipline similar to the GATT. Depressed commodity prices are seriously as Canada. For we attach particular importance to the fullest liberalization of trade with tarrifs but also with much emphasis on the agriculture sector. As the most recent-World Bank Development Report points out, international discipline in trade subsidies and trade restrictions can have a large and positive impact on developing adjustments international trade. Secondly, on development assistance: development assistance remains a critical complement to national efforts to realize human aspirations to multilateral development than Canadian aid on agriculture, energy and human resource development. In the multilateral context we are placing particular emphasis on three areas: the need for greater international s upport for the poorest countries, especially those in thirdly the pervasive and important role which women play in development. The third and final point I have to make is perhaps the most important one in the context of this Council. It is to reiterate Canada's belief that there is a growing need -55- Organization's capacities for assisting its members in dealing with the difficulties growing out of the current state of food and agriculture. Canadian delegates have often spoken for some years now in FAO governing bodies of their concern over such basic priorities, a ccounting in budget procedures, personnel management and the management of field activities. We are also convinced that there is a need for a hard look at the decision making process in governing bodies and how we set programmes and priorities. We believe that the rejuvenation of FAO via a variety of reforms will benefit all member states and by doing so will strengthen the Organisation itself. We are convinced that it is essential for the success of organisations such as FAO that they are constantly exposed to, and will welcome, new ideas in the approaches to developing new ideas and new approaches for dealing with new problems\u00b7 I terminate by mentioning this now, Mr Chairman, only because we believe that it is an important point to keep in mind as we consider the documents before us and those other papers coming up for study this afternoon and later on in the week. We believe we must be looking not only to the future of the state of food and agriculture, but also to the future state of the key UN agency which is responsible for helping us deal with agriculture. Similarly, in our discussions on reform of national and international food production and trading systems we must not turn away, however uncomfortable it may be, from a consideration of parallel reform the multilateral that evolving agricultural sector. To conclude I want to emphasise it is specifically because we in Canada are convinced of the importance of the UN system and most particularly of the FAO within that system that we are prepared to tolerate discomforts which sometimes be worthwhile to repeat that still 40 percent of Canadian development systems go through multilateral channels so their efficient functioning is almost as important to us as it is to the development assistance of recipient countries. Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of) (Original language Arabic): First of all I would like to thank you for the effective way of conducting the work at our Council, which has made it possible for us once again to entrust you to conduct in the appropriate way our activities. I would also like to thank Dr. Islam and the FAO in general for having submitted these documents to us. This broad-ranging Report, which is so rich in information, is particularly useful in terms of future projections of the situation, in particular of developing countries. This report has displayed difficult situation of economic burden of developing and these countries are suffering from the difficult economic problems, we see how many countries are maintaining a passive position when faced major problems, facing developing countries. This problem is something of which everybody is fully aware-the fact that the south is calling the north and the north is calling the south, but the two remain immobile, passive stance. We optimistic and say that we can solve the world economic crisis within the space of one year, but what we can do is reaffirm that if there is sufficient goodwill to establish a new and just international economic order, we think that this task can be achieved and both south and north will be able to embrace it. The economic structure of our world as we see it is an integrated circuit of circle which, whenever one of its links is weakened, causes the whole chain to fail in consequence. Nor fail to mention the of the developing and, in particular, the increase in their external debts and the protectionist measures which their exports are having to face. We think that this has repercussions also on the developed countries. Nonetheless, we should try ensure that this massive chain continues to work correctly for the benefit of everybody. This Report refers to a self-evident truth, the fact that economic interdependence between countries, particularly when they are countries of the same region, is something of absolute importance, which is why countries should persevere and work hard in order to relaunch and integrate this economic inter-relationship between ideological schemes. They should be doing this for the benefit of all their peoples. As for the developing countries in general, the enormous between is developments and improving the food situation seems to us to be crucial and can only be achieved by giving high priority to the agricultural sector, which require particular improved and maintained imported inputs which seems so vital to us for the improvement of agriculture production in these countries. Finally, I would like to mention that we expressed our pleasure at the fact that so many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America had managed to improve and increase their agricultural products and foodstuffs, had given greater priority to the agricultural sector, and had carried out specific and intensive improvements. As far as we are concerned, we would like to make an appeal to other countries to continue working fruitfully to ensure that with -56- people would achieve food self-sufficiency. We also hope that what has been achieved in these developing countries has not just been a fluke or an exception. We hope that this has been the fruit of a new logical structuring so that over time it will continue to strengthen this trend. I believe that I have a duty to mention paragraphs 171 and 178 where references are made to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia facing certain difficulties in exporting its wheat surplus. We believe that this is an improvement of what we were able to achieve in agricultural production particularly when we consider that there has only been a ten year period involved. Here, I should mention, agricultural production has increased in our country of the order of 14 percent. We think this is a major step forward and this is the fruit of collaboration between our political leaders and managers for carrying out projects on behalf of our people, particularly when the primary objective of agricultural developments within our Kingdom is to achieve self-sufficiency in all areas. As for the modest surpluses in wheat production in the last year, it gave rise to no kind of problem, since the majority of these surpluses have been distributed as food aid to friendly countries in need, or they were used for international trade with other countries in our region. Badr Jassim ALAWI (Iraq) (Original language Arabic): Please permit me to express my congratulations on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Iraq on your re-election to the Council Chairmanship. I am sure that this will guarantee the success of\u00b7our meeting and will lead to practical recmmendations in order to deal with the issues listed in the agenda. I would also like to express ray gratitude to the Director-General of FAO, Dr. Saouma, for the efforts he has make and will continue to make. These efforts have a major effect on FAO's work in achieving its humanitarian objectives. We support this report. All the issues listed on the agenda reflect the capacity of the in dealing with urgent problems that are closely linked to the improvement of the nutritional level of the peoples of the world and particularly the peoples of the Third World. The documents submitted to us have reflected the food problems and the widening economic and food between the developed and developing countries despite the improvement of food production in some countries. This makes it even more necessary for us to reconsider the international economic order in order to ensure a more equal distribution of economic resources among countries. Due to the importance of the agricultural sector and in order to achieve food self-sufficiency, the assistance provided Convinced of the importance of this sector, the Government of Iraq has taken a great deal of measures aiming at exploiting its natural resources in order to improve the productive capacity of the country. This is clearly reflected in the annual financial allocations for investment in the field of agricultural infrastructure. These investments were devoted to the construction of dykes and dams for the optimal use of water resources. Vast amounts of saline land were reclaimed and others were transformed from rainfed land to irrigated land in order to better control the factors of production. Emphasis has been placed on agricultural research which has a direct effect on the increase of production. We have also focused on extension as well as the provision of credit facilities and mechanization. Given that the human. being is the primary objective and tool of the revolution in Iraq, our country paid particular attention to the development and training of human resources through training programmes within and outside the country. Importance was also given to the training of women. The role of women in agriculture was stressed. As to the provision of services to the rural areas, the Government of Iraq supplied housing, water, electricity, schools, health and social care and the construction of roads in most rural areas. Immigration from the rural areas to the cities, which prevailed before the revolution, has completely stopped and has even been reversed in some aspects. Despite the war imposed on Iraq for more than six years, a great deal of progress has been achieved in the agricultural sector during the last few years. Various agricultural projects have been implemented. In view of the world food problem, we insist on the developing to their own food. -57- To allow FAO to carry out its mission to increase agricultural production in developing countries through the strengthening of its technical programmes, all Member States must support the Organization. I wish this meeting every possible success. Paul A. BOMANI (Tanzania): Mr. Chairman, let me at the outset express my deep appreciation to you for your wise leadership and firm but fair judgement, which was a moment ago displayed, in dealing with complicated situation created kind of pollution atmosphere of our deliberations. We feel fond confident that under your leadership this Council will su cceed in achieving what the b illions of people we represent here expect of us. I wish also to associate myself with the previous speakers, first to congratulate, second to thank the FAO Director- General Dr. Saouma and his staff for the excellent analysis on the State of Food and Agriculture as contained in document CL 90/2 and its Supplement. The document is comprehensive and accurately reflects the problems surrounding agricultural production in the world. In short, problems facing agricultural production are summed up as prices for agricultural commodities. Permit me to add that the low per unit cost production of agricultural products in the developed countries make the low prices offered in the world markets an advantage to those countries. Thus in one way it helps to provide foods to poor communities but also it causes some problems for the technological and approaches by approaches used creates a very of The situation in a way creates a serious problem for deficit countries and developing countries to be able to participate even when they have small surpluses in the export market. We know in the developing countries that we would only be able to compete if we emphasized quality, and quality of our products has been a major focus but we will not be able to achieve this unless the idea that has been discussed at the Regional Conference of African Countries in Cete d'Ivoire, Yamoussoukro, and that is aid in kind which we consider to be the very best and the right approach unless this idea is carried through the strategy for Africa's agriculture may not be able to attain the expected results. The state of external assistance to agriculture from both multilateral and bilateral is shown on Table 8 of the document, explains very clearly the situation is; while developing been urged to the transfer of technical know-how from developed countries has been lagging behind, in other words the transfer of technology and, perhaps I may add, appropriate technology to be able to help developing countries cope with the new development programmes has not been in keeping with the rhetoric. The capital aid material assistance through multilateral and or even bilateral is too slow and too little and just frittering out to reach the developing countries. Here we see very clearly some problems with of assistance to developing countries. this atmosphere not encourage the newly independent countries, the and to provide priorities to agriculture. I believe it is high time that these questions and issues should be re-examined. It is not enough to ask countries to institute reforms when those reforms can not be reinforced by serious follow-up of technical contribution and material support. I believe the assistance to developing countries should take a new face to enable production and productivity in agriculture to increase in the developing countries. It is very vividly reflected in the document before us that one of the problems affecting the efforts of developing countries debt which is becoming very stormy and is an impediment to the progress made in the developing countries. Structural and policies adjustments have been made and these have been suggested by donor countries with very good intentions and some changes have been realized in the economies of some of the developing countries. I can cite an example of my own country, that the use of fertilizer which was unknown just a few years ago, and for which we have now a demand we cannot cope with. The best techniques of husbandry are now becoming normal procedures in the countryside but the capability of providing inputs, incentive, including incentive goods, is lagging behind. This shows very clearly only be preparing studies year after year which will just be an exercise in futility, for no meaningful economic recovery will be achieved that way. It is no secret that in the area I come from the political destabilization caused by the situation in Southern Africa is a great impediment to our smooth work towards development and has contributed to low production in some countries in the front-line states. These states require assistance and, more than that, they need to be ensured of peace and stability in the areas so that they can get on -58- with their development work, so that they can produce food to feed their people, so that they can earn income to improve their standard of living, so that they can earn foreign exchange for the necessary imports and sustain their own growth, their own development. The Tanzanian delegation wishes to affirm its position on the noble role which is being played by FAO and IFAD, but the present financial position of these two prominent and important organizations is a major concern to us. As you will see when you examine the budge tary allocation and financial resources for these two organizations, it is very clear that there is nowhere that we can see a balance between expectation and goals and the availability of resources. We would like to appeal to the major donors to reconsider their position, especially on provision of financial resources committed, that they should be made available in keeping with the appropriate financial year. The funding of these institutions by instalment and in arrears does not really help in having proper planning for institutions and, an impossible job. We would like to seek the understanding and support of the donor countries to change their approaches so that the work that we all intend to achieve can be realized by proper funding and proper timing for the allocation of resources. Mr Chairman, we will have an opportunity later on to make a contribution on the resource question. Meanwhile I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to air these few remarks.

The problem of food production has always been of great importance and it has been included in the agenda at all Sessions of the Council. The statistical data submitted by the FAO Secretariat shows increases in the annual production of foodstuffs, while distribution remains uneven among continents and countries. The between foodstuffs in developing countries still exists. Obviously, the crisis in food supplies is part of the main problem, namely the economic backwardness and dependence of some countries. One subject of our attention during the last decade has been the problem of uniting the efforts of the world community to provide resources for investments in, and the training of specialists for seeds, machines, fertilizers and technology for the modernization and intensification of agriculture in a number of developing countries. At present, international aid is considerable but not sufficient. There is a need for large quantities of resources, part of which can be found in the countries themselves. The solution to this problem is bound up with the state of international economic relations, which does not contribute to the growth of the national economic potential of the developing countries. A serious obstacle to overcoming this problem is the use of food as a means of exerting political pressure. The protectionist trends in some western industrialized countries are causing grave harm to international trade. Only the establishment of a new economic order on a just and democratic basis will promote rapid economic development of the poorer countries. The problem with the indebtedness of the developing countries is of the most serious concern to the community. The accumulated indebtedness goes maintained. problem can be solved by eliminating all the obstacles to foreign trade, in particular their protectionist character. There is a need to establish normalization of the conditions for submitting loans with a low interest rate. The solution of the food problems is based on the development of industrial capacity within individual countries, agricultural modernization and the improvement of the social conditions in the rural regions. Probably, It is very difficult to elaborate a universal model for agricultural development, applicable in every country. Obviously the problems of malnutrition and must be all complexity. to stress the n ecessity for changes in production on the basis of progressive forms of management in the economy and better use of the available resources. The experience of the socialist countries in establishing agro-industrial complexes is significant. This is why thousands of young people from the developing countries are graduating from the universities in the countries of the world socialist system. The Peoples Republic of Bulgaria is expanding the economic and scientific and technical cooperation with developing countries on the basis of long-term planning. Many measures have been undertaken on our side to stimulate foreign trade with the developing countries. We have initiated a system of preferential duties on their imported goods, for some imported goods it is 50 percent and some are duty free. We should like to state our readiness to share our experience and knowledge with all who are interested. My delegation is deeply concerned about the financial situation of our Organization which is due to the reduction of contributions and the delay of payments to the regular Budget by some Member Countries. Before I conclude I should like to point out that only through general and complete disarmament and reduction of military spending can the enormous financial, human and material resources be provided, part of which can be used for the development of agricultural production and the elimination of malnutrition and hunger (IAEA): have been given the opportunity to draw your attention to a display which is on the ground floor of this building just opposite the entrance from building B. This display consists of photographs of a new laboratory facility which was constructed jointly by FAO and the International Atomic Energy Agency and also is operated jointly by the two agencies. When the joint FAO/IAEA division, which as you know is located in Vienna, became twenty years old two years ago the Director-General went to Vienna and addressed the General Conference of the IAEA, and on that occasion he suggested that the occasion be marked by the two agencies joining hands in constructing a laboratory for the training of agricultural scientists from developing countries and for supporting and assisting research in developing countries in the fields of plant and soil sciences. Exactly two years later the new laboratory was inaugurated by the Director-General of IAEA. This is part of a large complex of laboratories operated by IAEA and quite a large proportion is devoted to agriculture. The activities there are operated jointly by FAO and IAEA and often carried out in collaboration with the Government of Austria. This laboratory is rather unique. There are not many laboratories operated by the UN system, and it has greatly assisted the joint division in transferring rather advanced technology to scientists in developing countries. The laboratory, as I said, was funded by'joint contributions of FAO and IAEA for the construction. But I am very pleased to acknowledge here generous donations by other Member Nations. am to acknowledge the donation by the Government of Poland of all the furnishings of the laboratory. I am also grateful to the Government of the United States of America who donated a research training greenhouse which is now being constructed and to the Government of Canada, which donated a radiation source for use in plant breeding in etymology and so on and for training of young scientists.

SITUACI ON MUNDIAL DE LA AGRICULTURA Y LA ALIMENTACION 4. State of Food and Agriculture 1986 4. Situation de l'alimentation et de l'agriculture en 1986 4. El estado mundial de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n, 1986 Phillip JUICO (Philippines): Mr Chairman, first of all, I should like to apologize for passing up our turn. I was indisposed this morning. Nevertheless, on behalf of the government of the new Republic of the Philippines allow me to express our deepest appreciation for the opportunity you have given our delegation to contribute our own thoughts on the state of food and agriculture. We attach special significance to this Ninetieth Session, not only because of the important matters to be discussed but also because of the fact that this is the first Council meeting to which the new government is sending representatives. Before I give you our brief comments on document CL 90/2, permit me quickly to go over the present situation in the Philippines in macro-economic terms and in the food and agriculture subsector in particular. The Philippines views with great concern the issues raised in the documents and which were amplified by our colleagues from other member countries. I will not attempt to provide you with details of how we managed to topple the dictatorial regime of a man and a woman who have brought our country to a state of near collapse. I will not give you a personal account of what my role was and the' role of millions of Filipinos in oringing about change in the Philippines. That duty, noble and inspiring as it is, will be left with the many historians who have been recording and analysing the dynamics of what we call \"people's power\" and what President Corazon Aquino called in her speech before the Joint Session of the US Congress as \"the cheapest revolution in the history of mankind\". Suffice it to say the Philippines, after -63- 20 years of mismanagement faces of this debt has disappeared and evidence shows it has ended up in foreign shores\u00b7 Second, even with the new measures of reduced and increased revenues, the Government is 1. 3 billion deficit in its budget. Third, we have been experiencing negative GNP for the last several years. Fourth, about 70 percent of the population is living in poverty. The current economic factors the confluence against agriculture The previous government's policies tended to be concentrated on economic and political power in its hands and selected individuals in the private sector. inefficiency, has lifted government controls on the markets and on trade restrictions. It has encouraged truly democratic consultations and the policy formulation. The new government is committed to private enterprise and respect for human rights. The private sector is to serve as the prime mover in national economic recovery. It is deeply committed to implementing fundamental economic and political reforms. The major development priorities are to stimulate rural development and increase agricultural output and rural employment. As stated by President Aquino the highest priority will be given to agriculture, not only to realise the goal of equitable distribution of benefits and opportunities, but also to enable 70 percent of the population who live in the their productive assets and measures to institute genuine public accountability and effect meaningful trade liberation. It is this last item, trade liberation, which we are very concerned about. As mentioned earlier, we have a huge foreign debt which we can service only if we are given freer access to markets by countries, and groups of countries, which are sympathetic to the situation of the Philippines and other developing countries. A case in point is coconut oil which comes from copra, the product of the poorest of the poor of millions of our countrymen. Whilst we are grateful for the assistance given us by our friends, we are strongly convinced that trade concessions represent outright monetary grants. In short we believe in the principle of more trade than aid. One way of implementing this is looking at the many possibilities that barter or counter-trade schemes can offer. In concluding we once again express our hope that despite some reports of our well-meaning friends that tend to portray a country about to disintegrate, we shall, with the support of the international community and organisations like FAO, overcome the crisis in which we find ourselves. As in the February revolution, our faith in ourselves, people's power and most importantly, our faith in God, remains unshaken and forever strong. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia):-At the very beginning of my statement I would like to compliment FAO's Secretariat for providing us with a very useful, comprehensive, analytical and realistic document on the state of food and agriculture in the world. The enlightening statement by the Director-General yesterday further clarified the picture of the world food agricultural situation in the world as well as problems and difficulties faced by the Organization itself. The introductory statements by Mr Islam have assisted us very much in better understanding the situation and problems faced by food and agriculture in the world. The general world economic situation has improved somewhat during the last two years. Compared to the serious global economic crisis which prevailed only three to five years ago, however, improvements in the economic situation were only measured by statistical averages. In uneven among countries, regions and economic groupings. On one side the recovery of economic growth and general position of developed countries have improved. -64- On the other side, the of most developing countries remains very unsatisfactory and unfavourable. a limited number of developing countries mainly by themselves succeeded in having a relatively good economic development during the last few years. However, great have extremely low economic performance sin ce the beginning of the 1980s and their re lative position in the world economy has weakened considerably. I will not take the precious time of the Council to elaborate in detail on various data and assessments concerning the economic situation and the deteriorating position developing countries. This has been sufficiently and clearly presented and proved by figures in the reports of all international organizations dealing with trade, financial and development problems including UNCTAD, GATT and IMF, World Bank as well as by analysis of the OECD and by many scientific economic institutions of the world. On the basis of all these analyses and the data published, it is obvious that the pos ition of developing countries in the world economy has been decade. international difficulties and some weaknesses in management, the external economic environment has been particularly unfavourable. I will mention the markets of their ability to import n ecessary goods for their production, development and consumption, including food. Prices of agricultural commo dities of ies fell in 1985 by 41 percent compared to the level of 1980, according to the Trade and Development Report of UNCTAD. The collapse of of countries during this period resulted in a very significant real transfer of resources from developing to developed countries which, according to some reliable far over a hundred billion dollars annually. This transfer of resources from developed countries has been a significant blood infusion the of the economies in developed countries. In addition the development of the international monetary and financial system was also the source of great difficulties and losses for developing countries. Volatility of the biggest burden for most of the As a result of such an unfavourable external environment the growth of production of most of the developing countries contracted and many of them had negative growth rates when measured in terms of per capita. A further logical consequence was the deepening of the gap in the development between the developed and the developing countries. Even in such a general economic situation it could hardly have been expected for the conditions of food and agriculture performance to have been much better. The world food production increased by an average 2.6 percent since the beginning of this decade. That is far behind the target of 4 percent growth established by the World Food Conference 1974 and the strategy for the third development decade. The regional analysis shows further that even this average was due to the relatively successful performance of a few countries in Asia. Many African and other less developed countries, and others, are still in a very difficult situation. Other important indicators of the general picture of the state of food and agriculture, particularly of developing countries, are not encouraging. As a result of economic, and particularly balance-of-payments difficulties, the average annual growth in use of agricultural inputs has decreased sharply. This is well-illustrated by the data presented in Table 7 of the document CL 90/2 which shows that the growth rate of the use of fertilizers dropped from 11 percent in the 1970s to 3 percent in the beginning of the 1980s. In the same period the use of tractors per arable land dropped from 8 to 5 percent and that of irrigation from 1.1 to 0.2 percent. The flow of resources to agricultural developing countries, after some recovery in 1981/82, demonstrated a downward trend. The concessional OCA, which is of particular interest for the least developed and other low-income countries, dropped in 1982 to 7 billion -65- dollars in 1984, or by 15 percent. The trend prevailed in non-concessional assistance while direct foreign investments, which by the way have never been much interested in food production of developing countries, have also which have gained much through of trade, particularly by promoting extremely cheap prices in and not shown more understanding by keeping or increasing the level of assistance for food production in developing countries. But at the same time it would be unfair not to recognize that the developed countries did show a high degree of solidarity in assisting the drought and hunger stricken helped African, particularly Sahelien countries, to overcome shortages and hunger. This also contributed to the fulfilment for the first time of the 10 million tonnes aid grain target set by the World Food Conference in 1974 and of the target of 500 000 tonnes of grain in IEFR. While these facts have to be welcomed and praised, attention has to be drawn to the fact that food assistance is necessary and helpful, but only short-term solution. All efforts by the developing food-deficit countries and by the international community have to be concentrated in finding a lasting solution to the food problem by increasing their own food production and achieving the level of basic self-sufficiency. This period in which the pressure for emergency food was creating conditions for the growth of food production. The document which we are analysing contains a useful assessment of the resources invested in agriculture which shows that in the poorest coun-tries the bulk of investment in agriculture comes from the savings of the individual farmers themselves. These efforts lemented by governments and international communities if we really accomplish the set objectives. My delegation would encourage further and more comprehensive studies and suggestions by the FAO Secretariat in this report. Turning to the question of world food trade and security, there is for the time being on one side an abundance of food, much higher supply than and historically Low prices of grains. On the other side there is great need for food by more than a half billion of undernourished people in the world, but this need for food is not considered as a real demand because it lacks foreign currency resources to buy it. At the same time some important developed food producing exports. According to the latest assessment of GATT in its document CV 502 published just two weeks ago, only the United States and EEC are directly or indirectly with each other and bringing world market prices to the level below the cost of production. This has some temporary benefits for buyers but it has or may have long lasting negative consequences for agricultural producers and exporters both including those that I mentioned; and developing countries. It is high time for the parties concerned and for the international community to take adequate steps to get rid of this anomaly and structural and to create conditions for normal and reasonable competitive agricultural production and trade in the world. This would better serve the objectives of the world food security in the long run than the temporary illusion of abundance of food and low prices which prevail for the time being. As the first step to a lasting solution of the food problem and a stable world food trade security, the parties involved in the food competition with food export subsidies may decide voluntarily to channel only a small part, let us say one quarter of these amounts which they are spending annually for subsidies, less the additional assistance to food production in developing countries. I would not dwell any more on various aspects of the state of good food and agriculture because it would probably be repetition of facts which are contained in the documentation or which have already or will be stated by other delegates. At the end I would like to mention only two elements, the first that my delegation would like to stress the importance and to encourage our Organization as well as member among countries in all aspects of food and agriculture, namely in food production, processing, marketing as well as in the food security activities. -66- Last but not least, I would say just a few words and only to mention that agricultural production in Yugoslavia this year was, according to the latest assessment, 5 percent higher than a year ago but it should be kept in mind that the previous year 1985 was lower by 7 percent than the record 1984. In fact, we could consider the crop of 1986 as a good average year. John R. GOLDSACK (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom holds the Presidency of the European Community at the present time and as such I would like to give way to the Commission Observer to make a statement on behalf of the Community. With your permission I request that following the statement of the Commission Observer I may have the floor again to make the statement on behalf of the United Kingdom.

John R. GOLDSACK (United Kingdom): You will have noticed that we have a new Commission observer, and in welcoming Mr R\u00e2teau I would like to thank the retiring observer, Mr Desesquelles, for his past contribution to our endeavours. I would like to congratulate the Secretariat on the production of document CL 90/2 and the supplement, and I wish to make some observations, particularly on the forestry and fisheries sectors. on international agricultural trade, paragraphs 39-42, it is surprising to see no reference to the International Tropical Timber Agreement and the recent decisions on the effective establishment of the International Tropical Organization. 'Although the usefulness of this organization is yet to be proved it has great potential for securing greater benefit to both producer and consumer countries. This can be achieved through more efficient market information and assistance to conservation and development of the forest resource in tropical countries. This, incidentally, is provision. We should like to draw the attention of Council to the need to recognize this important development and to encourage close collaboration between FAO and the International Tropical Timber Organization. This is required with regard to information on tropical timber demand and supply and to assistance for the improved regeneration, management and conservation of tropical forests through support for research. In the section on recent development in fisheries, paragraphs 72-79, the report the virtual leve conventional fish catches by implication confirms the forecast of increasing shortfall of fish in the future. Accepted strategy do deal with this procedure is three-pronged: through the reduction of waste and losses, the development of aquaculture and the catching of unconventionalresources. The report also notes the decline of catches in Africa. While this, as suggested, is partly due to faulty statistical reporting, there are real and quite familiar reasons for the general stagnation. Important to the United Kingdom aid programme is the almost complete failure of aquaculture in Africa to date. FAO proposes drastic measures to deal with this but will need major support. Although the Director-General in his statement yesterday drew attention to the Tropical Forestry Action Plan it is surprising to see no reference to this in paragraphs 80-86. The plan is important for its detailed quantification of the need for a massive increase, twice the current level, in both national and external investments in forestry. I would like therefore to draw the attention of Council and of the governments of member countries, both donor and recipient, to the plan and to the need for FAO and aid recipient countries to review their own priorities for the allocation of resources. Whereas investment in agriculture generally has increased over the past two decades, more than 95 percent of aid agency agricultural investment has been channelled into products aimed at short-term forestry conservation. We should like to congratulate FAO on the production of their study \"African Agriculture, the Next 25 Years\". We largely agree the analysis and we see the need to support the four i's identified in the study. I refer to incentives, inputs, institutions and infrastructure. We feel that although the study has been discussed at the regional African conference in September 1986 it is of crucial importance and should be on the agenda for further discussion at COAG in March 1987 and before any final decision is ta ken to pursue the proposed study of aid in kind. In the field of policy reform, dealt with in paragraphs out of these politically difficult measures. The greater involvement of the private sector is now much to the fore in many countries and, despite traditional resistence in others, Dato on behalf of my delegation to welcome you in the chair and to congratulate the other members of your bureau on their election. I should like also to commend the Director- his very inspiring address yesterday and Professor Nurul Islam for his splendid introduction of this agenda item. -69- I agree with those distinguished delegates who have spoken before me that the documents before us are both very comprehensive and thought-provoking. However, their message is worrying. The economic outlook for the developing countries is bleak and filled with uncertainties. depressed rock bottom commodity prices and restrictive The West or the North have changed the rules for free trade which they once expounded. Comparative advantage is thrown overboard. The dividing and aid is being continu ously blurred. The rich are getting richer and Taken to I shudder to think what would become of this world. Some countries in Asia, for example, have managed to overcome their food deficiency situation to the stage of self- reliance and even have enough for export. But then it seems the more we produce the less we get. The order of the day as practised by developed economies seems to imports exports. There is no way fledging economies of the Third World could match the billions of dollars allocated by the developed economies to shut their It seems that condemnation of protectionism, both becoming a routine for us. However, I must say that we view this as the most critical issue in agriculture due to the inextricably close linkage between international commodity markets and the economic health of devel oping countries. What are the solutions? I think this is the one big challenge facing the world community and this august body of ours. There are no easy answers. We have to watch for every glimmer of hope. I therefore share the optimism of the Director-General and welcome the recent decision of the Punta del Este GATT Conference to include agricultural products in its new round of negotiations. I note that the FAO Secretariat will provide every assistance to these negotiations. But\" I Would such a supportive role be sufficient? As the specialized agency on food and agriculture with a rich reservoir of knowledge and experience at its disposal, I would suggest that it could play role by giving expert advice the already critical situation, perhaps there is even justification to hold an international exclusively devoted to agricultural trade, policies and issues. Turning to food aid, my delegation does not believe that handouts in the form of food aid, however generously in the term be the substitute for trade. We also believe that there should be a distinction between food aid and aid to produce food as frequently voiced out by the Director-General. For the sake of developing self-reliance the balance should tilt towards more aid to produce food. My delegation considers that increasing justification by countries which produce surpluses to these not solely for humanitarian reasons. It was Confucius who once said give man a fish, he will eat it; but teach him how to fish, it will last him a lifetime. It is remarkable that such eastern wisdom can still bear relevance to present day international relations. I should like to conclude by saying that economic health and food security are closely linked to trade, especially in agricultural products. The famine and suffering so far endured could have minimized, if not avoided altogether, if those countries affected were in sound economic state. Therefore, it is not just a moral duty, but rather a matter of logic that the international community should work more diligently towards the restoration of a healthy international market for agricultural products in order to allow for a decent and REDL (Austria): Before I comment upon the document before us, with your permission I should like to say a few words concerning the statement of the Director of the Joint FAO International Atomic Agency Division in Vienna. My country is happy that this Division is situat ed in Vienna. We support the activities of this Division. We believe the training is of the utmost importance, especially for the on a contribution of US$ 750 000 for the training centre in Seibersdorf within the period of the next three years. -70- Perhaps I may now turn to the statement on food and agriculture which is in front of us. First of all, I would like to thank Professor Islam for the introduction of the document The State of Food and Agriculture 1986. However, the document before us should also be seen in connection with other FAO publications and studies such as Food Outlook. In the edition of Oct ober 1986, it is stated that the world grain harves t 1986 amounts to US$ 1. 82 billion, percent below bumper crop of 1985, owing to a increase by some three percent in the industrialized countries. Worldwide, grain stocks will rise from 396 million tons at the end of the crop year 1985/86 and reach for the first time the level of 431 million tons in the current crop year. Thus, In view of the considerable export availability of grains on the one hand, and the restricted rise of the demand on the other, we will have to face a fierce competition in the world market. We have noticed with satisfaction the updated document CL 90/2 Sup. 1. With a certain satisfaction it was further noted that the situation in Africa is considered to be predominantly good. We fully agree with what is stated in paragraph 36 of this document. This document and recent information confirms earlier assessments that growth in global food and agricultural production has tended to slow down. The given outlook, for cereals is in our opinion a realistic one. The agricultural trade in 1985 and the first half of 1986 was generally more depressed than other sectors. Furthermore, a continued fall unit of agricul tural commodities brought about an overall deterioration in the agricultural terms of trade, and contributed to a sharp fall in the value of agricultural exports. Financing agricultural development in the first part of the eighties has been affected by the difficult economic and financial situation, and this will remain in the near future. Finally, I should like to mention the problem of unemployment and all its consequences. This problem is not included in the document before us. We would be pleased if in the future this could be included in the \"State of Food of Agriculture\". Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (original language Arabic):Mr Chairman, first of all I should like to say that we are pleased to see you chairing this Council, and we hope that you will be su ccessful. We should also like to thank the Secretariat for preparing this document. We would also like to thank Dr Nurul Islam for presenting it. My delegation is still somewhat optimistic despite the data contained in this document and especially in paragraphs 1 to 23 referring to the deterioration of the world economic situation in 1985 and the first half of 1986. What makes us cautiously optimistic are the projections of FAO as to the possibility of an increase in the agricultural production in the developing countries which will have a positive impact on the economies of the developing countries production in the developing countries is still dependent, to some extent, on the aid extended, and investments made, by the developed countries. We note that in this document the size of the multilateral assistance has increased by 16 percent as mentioned in paragraph 34 of this document. However, we are still concerned by the deterioration of the systems of agricultural products exchange and the increase of protectionism as mentioned in paragraphs 38 and 39. Therefore, we hope that the multilateral trade negotiations will be su ccessful and hope that they will be carried on a realistic basis as this is the only way to avoid fierce competition in the case of agricultural surpluses. The data contained in Table 6 shows an increase in the productive capacity, labour force, and the arable land in the Near East for the period 1980 to 1984, as compared to the period 1970 to 1981. We hope' that this trend will continue. Concerning the economic rehabilitation programme for Africa, the document shows that many interested parties are willing to provide financial and technical assistance. However, we would like to say that this assistance is not the only way to solve the food crisis in Africa. We think that self-dependency, hard work and regional cooperation are the most important factors to increase production. Against this background Egypt has asked during a meeting of the Union of African Agricultural Trade Unions held in Egypt October 1986 for a recommendation to establish a technical assistance fund in the African countries solve their problems. -71- There is another point I should like to mention and that is the increasing indebtedness and debt servicing costs which led to a slow down in agricultural growth in most of the developing countries. We hope that the and enable developing countries to devote most of their national income to agricultural development. The document mentions in paragraph 171 an increase in the level of food production in Egypt amounting to 4.2 percent. I should like to inform your august assembly that this increase applies also to most of the other agricultural crops reaching 12% in some cases during the last four years. This is due to the importance given by the Government to the agricultural sector because we have given the upmost priority to agriculture, so we agree with the contents of paragraph 274 which shows the important role national savings can play in agricultural development. Finally, after listening to the statement made by Dr Saouma, the Director-General of FAO, my delegation would like to thank him for this frank and objective statement and for the way he presented the problems and how we can tackle them. Mrs MILLICENT M. FENWICK (United States of America):I have a short paper that expresses my Government's position. We should like to thank you, Mr Chairman, and Dr Islam for the excellent report that we were given. This report correctly notes the existence of unusually large food supplies around the world. Cereal stocks at the end of 1985/86 were a nearly unpr ecedented 24 percent of total world consumption. Consequently, the Secretariat has devoted less space in this report to short-term food security concerns, and focused more upon the broader economic factors affecting agricultural development. The Secretariat documents have correctly characterized the US agricultural situation. To sa ve time, we will not duplicate FAO's very fine summary. Presenting indicators of resources in the section on financing agricultural development helps to begin to fill a very large gap in our knowledge of a crucial d\u00e9terminent of agricultural development. We recognize that FAO is breaking new ground in the assessment of internal resource flows and we urge continuing focus this area. We were particularly interested in the finding that private savings, and more particularly rural savings, are the main source of funds for investment in agriculture. (This is to set out in paragraph 230). The discussion of the relatively greater tax policy as opposed to \"explicit\" taxes upon the creation of favourable environment for agricultural investment appeared particularly important. Also a major issue at the end of the report (paragraphs 294 to 319) we found to be especially thought pr ovoking. We were expansion resource flows in the near future. The recognition that future agricultural growth will more likely come from the stimulation of for reading for policy makers attempting to bring both private and public resources to bear most efficiently upon agricultural development. The United States is acutely aware of external debt problems hampering economic development (I may say we have a very handsome debt problem of our own) in many countries. We strongly believe that the IMF and World Bank fora rounds. There are substantial opportunities for liberalizing agricultural trade in those GATT rounds. Now I should like to say a few personal remarks. Many of us are gathered here again, year after year, hoping to be useful in a tremendous endeavour to try and strike a substantial blow against terrible suffering in the world. The fact is that there are some 600 000 million people with absolutely no purchasing power at all. What have we learned? We have learned a few things. One is that the other name for famine, for hunger, is poverty. We know that in every country without exception the rich, the people who have money very seldom suffer that kind of hunger, and it does not matter which country we are talking about. -72- It is poverty which is the terrible enemy here and the lack of any individual resources. How do you increase agricultural production and well-being at the very bottom of the line, at the end of that long road?You increase it by allowing the individual small farmer to produce and sell irrespective of fixed prices, to sell and put money in his pocket. That is the answer. We have seen it everywhere. Nations are turning to it one after the other. Where they had thought there were perhaps other better ways, they are now turning to this if they really want production. If we really want to see the end of this kind of helpless poverty, as somebody had said it must be \"trade not aid\". How can you put people in the position of being able to choose for themselves what they want in the way of food or anything else?This can only be done if they can produce, sell, and become part of the world of production. We may have some good ideas about technology and how we could help them to make a more bountiful harvest, but there is something else which I think who have learned. You can go with that kind of information in your head, but if you have no respectfor people in your heart you are not going to persuade them. The minute that you turn your back, without respect for the people you are trying to help, you are talking to the wind. We have to understand that people have ways which are precious to them. Their grandfathers did certain things, and we cannot just say \"You are foolish. We know better. We have some wisdom from on high\". We must come with ideas, but they must be carefully, and with respect, eased into the ways of people, not saying \"Nothing that you do is worth listening to\". I have a friend here, a member of delegation, going back to Papa who lives on a farm. Papa had said to him \"Something is wrong with the crop\", and he had said \"Well, I have just come out of agri-cultural college. I will tell you, Papa, what we have to do for that crop\". Papa listened and began to smile and said \"I tried that three years ago. It doesn't work\". He knew. He had lived with that farm, with that crop, with that land, with that soil and that moisture, and if he had not known he would not be alive. You cannot just throw away all these things. You are not going to convince people if you do not care about them. I think that is one of the first things we have to learn. We talk about unemployment here. What do I say about unemployment?I say:let these farmers have a little something, some agro-based industries, \"and they will grow. When we had Mr Hamdi here from Egypt he told us about the remarkable thing FAO had done with the strawberry planting. All the people who had gone into strawberry planting had made some money, so they were able to produce a little employment locally because they had some cash. We have to be firm aboutthe cash component. If people are working on state roads, if they are landless, perhaps, and happy to work on state roads they have to have a cash component in their wages. You cannot treat people badly and expect them to produce as happy and independent citizens. Nehru said a wonderful thing once which I think we all ought to remember. Nehru asked: He answered it himself: a man who. has a wooden plough the opportunity to get himself a metal plough, not just because you get more production but because you get the attitude and the belief of an independent man who is able to do something for himself and his family. \"That is progress. That is the way I see it. I think that is what we have to concentrate on, and then all the big global business will take care of itself. Robbie Matongo MUPAWOSE (Zimbabwe): This meeting is taking place at a time when many countries in Southern Africa are preparing for their new cropping seas. On, having come out of a reasonable production season in 1985/86 which has greatly improved the food supply situation in the region. As a result of increase production by small scale farmers in the case of Zimbabwe, coupled with favourable rains over the last two years, and reasonable producer prices and other support services, the production of maize, sorghum and millets has increased substantially in relation to domestic Deliveries of maize to the grain marketing boards reac hed the order of 1.8 million tonnes in 1985/86, with an additional 1.6 million tonnes in the current 1986/87 marketing year. In both years the small scale sector contributed 45 percent of the nationalintake of maize-about 800 000 tonnes -73- in addition to a quarter of a million tonnes of sorghum and millets. These quantities alone without including the commercial farmers, are in excess of the national off take, that is the national sales from the marketing boards. We are therefore facing a situation where large stocks of accumulated, giving rise to high storage costs and considerable pressure on the facilities of the marketing institutions. Grain stocks at the commencement of the next intake will be in ex-cess of two years' requirements at the current level of domestic sales, that is 1.5 million tonnes of stocks. Local sales ha ve declined to only 650 000 tonnes per annum due to the increased avail-ability of food in the country, compared with 1 million tonnes during the peak of the drought in 1984 when families had exhausted their food reserves. Concurrently, export prices for grains have fallen to a level which would result in very sub stantial trading losses on the disposal of surplus grains into overseas markets. We have had to take stringent measures to reconcile the future production of grains cropping programmes for next year and reduce maize plantings to about 50 percent of last year's deliveries. farmers have, however, exempted from the restrictions in view of the fact that maize is their staple food crop, and we would not want to destabilize the food production base that has been su ccessfully established in that sector over the past five years. Drought is an endemic phenomenon in our region, and this is a fact to bear in mind when designing agricultural policies. Efforts are being made to broaden the productive base in this sector and expand the present production of oilseeds, horticulture, cotton, sugar, tea, coffee, and also expand fisheries and possibly introduce other crops which can be readily absorbed by the market. Great priority is being given to the question of nutrition at the household level by encouraging the correct balance of crops grown by In to dairy encouraged with emphasis on increasing the off-t\u00e0ke of cattle from the small scale sector, not only in order to improve income for the farmers and beef supplies on the but also in an effort to control stocking rates and protect the environment. Efforts being made in afforestation and in combatting soil erosion. It is our policy not to produce grains for the overseas market, but at times, even with the best of plans, farmers react positively and produce surpluses. We aim and reasonable security stocks. Anything beyond our requirements, we are keen to export to our neighbours. We were pleased and would like to support and restate the views of our Zambian colleagues expressed yesterday. Last we the on triangular transactions especially for grains. would Dr Saouma, has often made reference to the importance of triangular arrangements. Mr, Chairman, we are conscious of the surpluses in the donor countries and their farmer lobbies. But, it should be recognized that shipment of food commodities be they maize, beef or milk products, into our regions at subsidized costs only stifle our modest attempts to improve our agriculture. In our SADCC region, in the current period Malawi and Zimbabwe have been disadvantaged in disposing of surpluses. Instead of shipments from overseas into our region, we would plead that donor assistance be sourced from within the and at realistic exchange rates. We appreciate the efforts by Australia, EEC, the United States and the World Food Programme, but the quantities involved have been very small. Further, it has been a battle to persuade some of these countries positively to commit themselves. Major problems with in suppl fixing a cceptable exchange ratios, the existence of cheap food in donor countries and the lack of information on demand projections in recipient countries. The need for such support w ill become even greater in Southern Africa, especially in the case of landlocked countries, given the the possible impact of economic sanctions on agricultural production in neighboring states. -74- I thank you for the opportunity to highlight some of the cr itical issues related to food supply and marketing, and at the same time remind delegates of the increased need for international assistance for agricultural and transport projects to combat the current plight being faced by frontline states in Southern Africa. It should also be appreciated that some of our countries live in a hostile region, with neighbours like South Africa who control our routes to the ports and destabilize the frontline states. Positive efforts should be made to help us wriggle from the South African clutches. Some developed countries, due to self interest, still play hide-and-seek on the issue of sanctions against South Africa. Until our region is rid of the South African apartheid scourge, we shall continue to spend resources on security which otherwise would be best used for meaningful life of and intereferes with their agricultural activities, resulting in poor food production and hunger. I would like to compliment FAO on a fine document on The State of Food and Agriculture (1986 ). Further, I wish to express our gratitude for support on projects in Zimbabwe, and also to the SADCC regional programmes. There are many efforts which can only be meaningful if tackled on a regional front. The document SADCC Agriculture Toward 2000 was well done and very much commended, and Combat on the Red Locust by assistants from the FAO. Also, we wish to draw attention to the menace by Army worm and qualea birds which often devastated a crop and also the problems we have had with the tsetse fly. It is hoped that FAO, IFAD and the World Food Programme will r eceive meaningful resources to effect development assistance in our region and in other developing countries. Guy FRADIN (France): Je menaces font pays une \u00e9conomie qui \u00e0 sortir notre esp\u00e9rance dans le combat contre la faim et pour le d\u00e9veloppement. Je note en premier lieu, la deuxi\u00e8me reconstitution du international ce Fonds. La sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 de ses objectifs et de son mode de fonctionnement la FAO \u00e0 satisfaisante: je note en trouve malheureusement pas n\u00e9ant. A indispensable que pays donateurs participent \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition de ces exc\u00e9dents de quelques r\u00e9flexions que nous document Je partage tout du Secr\u00e9tariat en concerne concurrence de plus en plus f\u00e9roce qui se livre sur les march\u00e9s nationaux produits. de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise, M. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, rappelait il y a un an \u00e0 la tribune de la Conf\u00e9rence l'opposition de la France au protectionnisme et soulignait que tourner les diff\u00e9rences importantes qui existent entre les \u00e9conomies des pays en d\u00e9veloppement, et comment ne pas voir que d'appeler \u00e0 la lib\u00e9ration des en particulier. Je le rappelle une fois de plus, nous plaidons le droit \u00e0 tout pour nous l'occasion rappeler ce des d\u00e9veloppements des secteurs urbain et rural. Dans 20 ans la population sera essentiel-lement urbaine dans beaucoup de pays du Tiers l'agriculture fait essentiel de urbain. voudrais maintenant attirer votre attention sur le para. 139: il es t tr\u00e8s important de noter que dans les pays de que je disais \u00e0 l'instant: la lib\u00e9ration je dois le dire, une fois de commune. -16- Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): La delegaci\u00f3n de Cuba ha analizado con sumo cuidado el documento CL 90/2 que nos presenta la Secretar\u00eda de la FAO. En primer t\u00e9rmino quiero felicitar al Director General por su intervenci\u00f3n en la ma\u00f1ana de ayer en la cual nos ofreci\u00f3 la ocasi\u00f3n de analizar el camino recorrido y trazar la futura ruta de la organizaci\u00f3n, embarcada ahora en las dificultades financieras y el endeudamiento creciente de la econom\u00eda y el desarrollo. Sobre estos dos aspectos tendremos oportunidad de referirnos espec\u00edficamente durante la sesi\u00f3n de este Consejo. El tema que analizamos sobre \"El estado de la agricu ltura y la alimentac i\u00f3n 1986\", que nos ha sido presentado brillantemente por el profesor Islam, en una primera observaci\u00f3n de nuestra parte, es la s\u00edntesis que nos facilita el an\u00e1lisis sobre su principal funci\u00f3n en base de datos para una reflexi\u00f3n seria del tema. Como aparece en el p\u00e1rrafo 15, que para nosotros es una s\u00edntesis bastante objetiva, la estimaci\u00f3n con respecto al 86 es poco alentadora para la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Se prev\u00e9 la ca\u00edda constante de los precios de los productos b\u00e1sicos lo que causar\u00e1 un deterioro de su relaci\u00f3n de intercambio, la reducci\u00f3n resultante de los ingresos de exportaci\u00f3n, disminuci\u00f3n inevitable de las exportaciones, menoscabar\u00e1 la capacidad de pago de la deuda y retrasar\u00e1 inevitablemente su crecimiento econ\u00f3mico. Esto puede ser el compendio de un an\u00e1lisis inicial, seg\u00fan nos plantea en esta parte el informe, que se llama An\u00e1lisis Mundial. A nuestro entender no existen elementos que nos indiquen el inmediato cambio importante en la producci\u00f3n y la satisfacci\u00f3n de la demanda de alimentos, por lo cual la vulnerabilidad de las econom\u00edas de los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados ir\u00e1en aumento. Podemos expresar que estamos en presencia de una crisis permanente del sistema econ\u00f3mico imperante. Como usted bien conoce, se\u00f1or Presidente, la llamada crisis alimentaria no es un fen\u00f3meno correspondiente a los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Para la mayor\u00eda del mundo subdesarrollado la crisis econ\u00f3mica debe entenderse como una condici\u00f3n secular permanente de sus precarias vidas. Para ellos no tieneapenas sentido la hipot\u00e9tica recuperaci\u00f3n de las econom\u00edas desarrolladas, pues ni siquiera los m\u00e1s vigorosos auges econ\u00f3micos han sido capaces de evitar la presencia del hambre y la subalimentaci\u00f3n en el Tercer Mundo. Para los centenares de millones de hambrientos que habitan en este mundo, la crisis alimentaria no es una simple referencia conceptual, sino una presencia diaria y una afrentosa real ided para toda la humanidad. La magnitud de las personas afectadas por la pobreza rural que cada decenio es redescubierta por las mismas corrientes de pensamiento que se aferran a un orden econ\u00f3mico injusto donde el hambre y la malnutrici\u00f3n tienen un sostenido crecimiento, a pesar de lo relativamente satisfactorios niveles de producci\u00f3n. Esta es la palabra que siempre aparece en t\u00e9rminos econ\u00f3micos en los informes. Por lo general, se\u00f1or Presidente, este grupo de problemas se interpreta a trav\u00e9s de expresiones como inflexibilidad de la oferta agr\u00edcola, de formaci\u00f3n estructural del sector agr\u00edcola, son insuficientes como explicaci\u00f3n comprensiva de un papel de crecimiento sin que desconozcamos que existe esta situaci\u00f3n. Esto, se\u00f1or Presidente, no lo entienden las grandes mayor\u00edas \u00bfse puede entender la insuficiencia de producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola para mitigar el hambre, si la confrontamos con la potencialidad de los recursos disponibles y con la necesidad de millones de mujeres, ni\u00f1os, hombres y ancianos en Asia, Africa, Am\u00e9rica Latina y en Oriente?Pasan hambre cr\u00edtica, no desnutrici\u00f3n. Hambre cr\u00edtica y desnutrici\u00f3n son distintos factores. Nos preguntar\u00edamos nosotros \u00bfSon realmente estos problemas consecuencia del desarrolllo deficiente de la agricultura? 0, por el contrario, \u00bftendr\u00eda que empezar a decirse que es precisamente dicho desarrollo con sus modalidades espec\u00edficas del orden econ\u00f3mico actual lo que ha contribuido a su persistencia? Por otra parte \u00bfla insuficiencia de la producci\u00f3n y de la demanda de alimentos y las consecuencias asociadas a los patrones de la utilizaci\u00f3n y control de los recursos b\u00e1sicos han constituido efectivamente problemas, obst\u00e1culos o distorsiones dentro de la l\u00f3gica del funcionamiento de la agricultura del sistema econ\u00f3mico en su conjunto?0, m\u00e1s importante a\u00fan, \u00bfhasta qu\u00e9 punto las estructuras econ\u00f3micas actuales son compatibles con la superaci\u00f3n de dichos problemas e insuficiencias?Es evidente que estas preguntas no son pertinentes entre los esquemas del orden econ\u00f3mico actual, pero \u00bfc\u00f3mo explicamos a las masas de obreros, campesinos, mujeres y j\u00f3venes la contradicci\u00f3n de que la penetraci\u00f3n del progreso t\u00e9cnico provoca el empeoramiento de la condici\u00f3n de vida? -77- \u00bfC\u00f3mo explicamos a una zona rural, a un campesino, que un tractor le puede hacer pasar hambre? Mientras hay m\u00e1s tractores hay m\u00e1s hambre. \u00bfY c\u00f3mo explicamos que la expansi\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n se hace a costa de la permanencia de las deficiencias nutricionales. \u00bfC\u00f3mo explicamos que la disponibilidad de nuevos recursos productivos se hacen tanto que disminuyen relativamente la capacidad ocupacional agr\u00edcola? En este Consejo, se\u00f1or Presidente, se ha dicho que este tema se repite, se repiten los an\u00e1lisis de Consejo a Consejo, de Conferencia a Conferencia; que los problemas de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n no se resuelven con los mismos an\u00e1lisis de 1984, cuando la Conferencia Mundia l Alimentaria. Esto lo expres\u00f3 sabiamente nuestro colega el Embajador Bula Hoyos, de Colombia. Nosotros pensamos, se\u00f1or Presidente, que todos conocemos los esfuerzos que ha hecho la FAO y su Director General durante su gesti\u00f3n para racionalizar el funcionamiento, reducir los gastos administrativos, conseguir fondos al Programa Ordinario para utilizarlos directamente con los Estados miembros, sobre todo con los m\u00e1s n ecesitados. En estos momentos en que las dificultades financieras de la Organizaci\u00f3n hacen necesario tener frente a ella una personalidad decidida y con experiencia\u00bfpodr\u00edamos hablar de imposibilidad de reel ecci\u00f3n? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?Cosa m\u00e1s grave a\u00fan, \u00bfpodr\u00edamos privar a la Organizaci\u00f3n, cuando m\u00e1s lo necesita de la guia de una persona competente, de una personaque conoce a fondo todos sus problemas y sabe lo que es necesario para resolverlos y que si no los ha resueltoen alguna medida es porque est\u00e1 sometido su presupuesto hace muchos a\u00f1os al crecimiento cero?Cuando crece demogr\u00e1ficamente el mundo, cuando crecen las necesidades, cuando crecen las Naciones miembros del sistema de Naciones Unidas el crecimiento cero impone restricciones que no le permiten aplicar la ayuda n ecesaria. Entre los mecanismos excepcionales de los que podr\u00edamos hablar hay uno que se llama Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica. Este es un mecanismo excepcional, operativo, expedito, de transferencia tecnol\u00f3gica a trav\u00e9s de los peque\u00f1os proyectos, peque\u00f1os proyectos que llegan a juicio del que lo solicita, cada pa\u00eds; la FAO da la transferencia del apoyo y la ayuda de t\u00e9cnicos, en su mayor\u00eda t\u00e9cnicos del mundo desarrollado. Estamos conscientes del nivel de desarrollo y de la diferencia del nivel de desarrollo y son los t\u00e9cnicos de los pa\u00edses desarrollados los que llegan a nuestros pa\u00edses con estos peque\u00f1os proyectos que no han creado deuda en ning\u00fan pa\u00eds y que garantizan una transferencia tecnol\u00f3gica limpia. Ahora, se\u00f1or Presidente, despu\u00e9s de dicho esto creemos que si la ley fat\u00eddica del intercambio desigual del que aqu\u00ed se ha hablado mucho, persiste, si los precios de nuestros productos b\u00e1sicos contin\u00faan deterior\u00e1ndose hasta niveles nunca conocidos, si se incrementan las medidas proteccio-nistas, si se reconooen las pr\u00e1cticas del dumping que arrebatan mercados a nuestros productos, si contin\u00faan altas las tasas reales de intereses, si no se realiza la corriente de recursos financieros en condiciones apropiadas al desarrollo econ\u00f3mico a que aspiramos, si se aplican pol\u00edticas monetarias que encarecen el d\u00f3lar estadounidense, moneda en la oue tenemos establecida la mayor\u00eda de nuestras deudas, y si no se desestimula la fuga de capitales nacionales hacia los Estados Unidos de Norteamerica, si no se revierte la irracional tendencia de convertir a nuestras regiones en exportadoras netas de recursos financieros y no se nos da acceso a los productos agr\u00edcolas, en el Tercer Mundo, en los mercados internacionales con precios justos no podremos ni siquiera mitigar nuestra tragedia econ\u00f3mico-social dentro de la guerra de los aranceles que se desarrolla en todos nuestros despojos. Con tendencia feroz se acaba de expresar nuestro colega de Francia; y nosotros en el medio. Actualmente uno de los problemas m\u00e1s graves que tiene el mundo, que considero que en el documento se ha tratado en algunos p\u00e1rrafos con un poco de ambig\u00fcedad, pero con bastante objetividad en todo su an\u00e1lisis, es el de la deuda externa. Esta deuda externa que tiene el mundo subdesarrollado hoy, debido al hecho de que por imperiosa necesidad de desarrollo, en ocasiones incluso de supervivencia, los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados se vieron en la necesidad de ir a dquiriendo progresivamente compromisos que han tra\u00eddo como consecuencia un incremento notable de su deuda exterior y de su dependencia. Las estructuras econ\u00f3micas de nuestros pa\u00edses d\u00e9biles y subdesarrollados se deforman aun m\u00e1s a causa de la deuda. Abundantes y f\u00e1ciles cr\u00e9ditos otorgados por la Banca Internacional, han convertido a los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados atrav\u00e9s de la deuda y del pago de sus servicios, en un conjunto de pa\u00edses cautivos, rehenes y tributarios de ese capital financiero sin perspectiva de pagar los intereses de esa deuda. -78- Ante este panorama creemos que m\u00e1s que analizar posibilidades y alternativas debemos pensar seria-mente en revalorizar la lucha por un nuevo orden econ\u00f3mico internacional. Un nuevo orden econ\u00f3mico internacional que nos ayude a suprimir las diferencias, a suprimir el desequilibrio en el desarrollo, el hambre, la miseria, la marginaci\u00f3n por la pobreza, todo lo cual genera violencia; la violencia individual del hambriento que tantas inquietudes pol\u00edticas produce, no s\u00f3lo es la amenaza de la guerra nuclear, que nos tiene que concitar a defender una paz precaria; hay que crear una convivencia humana, saludable, educada y nutrida. Estos son los problemas primarios para un nuevo orden econ\u00f3mico que elimine tambi\u00e9n todo vestigio de violencia, de subversi\u00f3n, de racismo, de apartheid , de guerras locales. Con guerras nucleares el mundo ecol\u00f3gicamente se hace inhabitable. \u00bfC\u00f3mo podremos resolver eso si el egoismo econ\u00f3mico no nos permite ver m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de nuestras fronteras? Se\u00f1or Presidente, un mundo t\u00e9cnico y cient\u00edficamente en condiciones de grandes empresas extraterres-tres que insume miles de millones pero que no es posible dar algunos millones para apoyar a la FAO, Organismo del Sistema de Naciones Unidas, especializado en la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 se ataca al sistema multilateral?. Este mundo tiene que cargar tambi\u00e9n con la afrenta de no ser capaz de resolver el hambre de m\u00e1s de setecientos millones. Creo que la expresi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica bajo este orden econ\u00f3mico financiero no permite la utilizaci\u00f3n de recursos y riquezas, sometido por un mecanismo de endeudamiento. Se\u00f1or Presidente, si las Naciones Unidas deciden que el primer paso para liberar al hombre de la necesidad es liberarlo de la necesidad de a limentos ello requerir\u00e1 una rigurosa acci\u00f3n nacional en cada pa\u00eds y una, igualmente fuerte, de car\u00e1cter internacional para asistir a los pa\u00edses que carecen de conoc imientos y medios financieros n ecesarios para mejorar la producci\u00f3n de a limentos. Este p\u00e1rrafo es producto de la mente fecunda de Mc Dougall en su famoso memorandum. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 en vez de mantener una posici\u00f3n intransigente no recordamos su grandeza, su dedicaci\u00f3n a la causa del desarrollo, cumpliendo con sus postulados?. Hay que crear la verdadera solidaridad libre del egois-mo econ\u00f3mico que es el que nos ciega fuera de nuestras fronteras. Para finalizar, porque sobre las virtudes del documento y sobre la situaci\u00f3n incierta los colegas han hablado con bastante objetividad, queremos finalizar diciendo que la delegaci\u00f3n de Cuba apoya la propuesta del Presidente Barco, de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia, sobre la convocatoria de una conferencia para erradicar la pobreza absoluta en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. Esperamos que la FAO pueda participar en esa Conferencia para apoyar los esfuerzos de nosotros, los latinoamericanos. Queremos tambi\u00e9n apoyar la petici\u00f3n de la delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico para que la FAO termine el estudio sobre la actuaci\u00f3n yparticipaci\u00f3n de las transnacionales en la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n. Estas son cuestiones muy importantes para Latinoam\u00e9rica en estos momentos. Chavaly SRINIVASA SASTRY (India): Permit me to join the other delegates in complimenting the Economic and Social Policy Department of the FAO Headquarters for the outstanding report in the two documents presented to the Conference. These cover not only food and non-food production but also forests and livestock and fish. Indeed they present the primary sector as a whole in its global dimensions. The analysis presented in the report is all the more praiseworthy when we consider the limitations in terms of availability of data and variations in definitions over space and time. The two footnotes on page 49 of the document CL 90/2 succinctly sum up the difficulties that Dr Nurul Islam and his colleagues must have had to contend with in preparing this report. The quality of this documentation has been bettered, if I might say so, only by the masterly presentation yesterday by Professor Nurul Islam while introducing his report for the Conference. I might add that, on certain aspects where our definition for agricultural statistics have been different from those of FAO standards, we have recently decided to adopt the FAO pattern. Before I deal with some of the aspects covered by the report I would like to congratulate and compliment the developing countries from Africa on their agricultural success in 1985 and 1986. One could regard this effort as testominy, if testimony were needed, for the effectiveness of FAO in helping the developing countries tackle their food production problems. -199- As paragraph 30 of supplement 1 points out, there has been a growth of over 8 percent in food production in 1985 and 1986 combined. In the contex t of the drought and the scarcity prevailing over large areas in Africa in the r ecent past, it is heartening to note that seven African countries have an exportable surplus of 2.5 million tons of coarse grains, while six others have clearly proves that given conditions with the national and effort, coupled with the international cooperation, the problem of food shortages, at least in terms of production, if not in terms of distribution and availability, can be solved in most developing countries. We should African countries are still facing abnormal shortages and that there is a serious risk of widespread starvation in Southern Sudan. We have no doubt that through the efforts of FAO, World Food Programme and other international organizations and also through triangular in the also hope that in the long term, programmes will be drawn up and implemented to augment production aiming at self-reliance, if not self-sufficiency, wherever possible. Reading the report leaves me with some uneasiness with the trends and portents in world trade in agricultural commodities. While on the production front, or on the supply side, the signal could be regarded as cautiously optimistic, on the demand or distribution side, whether it is in terms of trade in international markets or the purchasing power of vast multitudes in the developing countries, the signs are somewhat disturbing. As the report says, the production gains have been greater in the traditional importing food countries, while deceleration in output marked in the developed country exporters, particularly North America, the main exporting regions among the developing countries in Latin America. As we are all aware, in the developing countries the base of the datum line is relatively low. As a result even small increases in absolute could look are in absolute terms be rather impressive. The report on failed to products. The report also points out that developing regions, the Far East in particular, are severely affected by adverse movements in agricultural terms of trade in 1985. What is, however, more worrying is that the report points out in paragraph 58 that with the lone exception of coffee a further fall in agricultural terms of trade is expected in 1986. However, many developing countries can draw some comfort from the to the which many developing countries, including India, have to import to step up agricultural production have declined steeply. The fall ranges from 50 percent over one year for urea and ammonium sulphate to 12 to 16 percent for phosphatic and potassic fertilizers. This, in a manner of speaking, is some consolation. We all know the compulsions, the complexities and the intricacies of international trade, particularly in agricultural and the various factors which influence the fluctuating terms of trade. We aware that in various international agencies and fora, whether it is GATT, FAO or the United Nations, efforts are being made to sort out these complicated problems. One does wish that these efforts will su cceed in forging a solution that is just, fair and equitable. But what is really more worrisome is the long-term view, what is likely to happen in the next ten to twenty years on the world food front. As more and more developing countries increase their agricultural production and productivity and more and more carry-over food supplies have to be stacked in godocons, how is the situation going to be tackled? As the report points out, the most troubling issue for agricultural trade in recent years has been the escalating competition in the world markets and the mounting proliferated. As the years go chances are that this issue might assume larger proportions. In that event, how does one deal with the world order if, as the report says, even low cost producing countries cannot compete in world markets. -80- The second major policy issue, as so ably summed up by the Director-General, DrSaouma, in his address yesterday, is that food security is not just a problem of production but of income as well. As the report points out, in 1980 to 1984 the per caput calorie intake declined in 46 out of the 102 developing countries for which data is available. Referring suffered by countries with the of DES. In terms of the long-range perspectives for world order this is an aspect which calls for careful and serious consideration. The other major issue is the level and extent of subsidies to agriculture to make it competitive in international markets. This is the only way in which, if the current trends continue, exports in the future the developing to the developed countries. In a country like India where about 70 percent of the population is engaged in agriculture and agriculture contributes over 50 percent of the gross domestic product, any substantial subsidies to agriculture will cast a burden on the non-agricultural segment of its economy burden that might well-nigh become unbearable of In in the developed countries with the percentage of population in agriculture being often in the single digits and the contribution of agriculture to the GDP not of significant magnitude, cross subsidization could possibly be an expedient which one could live with. In this context it is significant and it is very interesting that the United States has to lower the price support levels for cereals for the 1986 crops. Predictably, however, this step has led to a further reduction in the wheat and maize prices. In the long-term perspective how can this problem be tackled? One solution that is being tried out is to have more trade bilaterally so that imports and exports get tied up and matched. It is arguable whether in terms of international trade this is a healthy or desirable development, but this practice does seem to have some advantages at least in the short term. I am sure that these larger issues must be all the the developed countries or the developing and one does the and the built-in conflict of interests some pragmatic solutions could be hammered out in the world fora so that the comity of nations get a feeling that the problems have been tackled fairly and justly. I would now make a few observations on the aspects relating to India in the section relating to the Regional Review. We are happy to note from paragraph 62 of the report that in the 1980s growth rates in land and labour of productivity have increased in India, though with a score of 4 percent in labour and 5 percent in land we are well behind the Republic of Korea with 7 percent. While this is an area in which we have achieved some progress, the ways by which the farmer can be given flexibility in cropping patterns are now as the report observes in paragraphs 151 and 155, India achieved a 5 percent growth in food and agricultural output resulting in plentiful supplies of cereals, cotton, tea and increase the production of edible oils. However, despite the drought of 1985, we were able to maintain the record production levels of 1983 and 1984. In 1986 this was also the case despite the current drought and floods, and we are confident of reaching the production levels of 1983 and 1984, if not marginally ex ceeding them. But the real problem, as highlighted in paragraph 158, is that the grain surpluses can neither be exported without subsidies nor be disposed of. internally without reduction in market and support prices. The dilemma of the policy makers, as the report so per ceptively observes in paragraph 160 is the immedi ate concerns for food security, remunerative returns to alleviation poverty and the achievements We have as indicated in paragraph 161, increased grain distribution to target groups through enlarged food-for-work programmes. Simultaneously we have liberalized mills purchase their wheat requirements directly from the market and not through the -81- Food Corporation of India. Agricultural prices constitute an important factor in increasing production. tabled policy document parliament se approach to the long-term agricultural price policies. The pressures and the competing demands have been delineated, and it is hoped that the policy document charts a course of action which would make for a speedier and more balanced growth and development of agriculture with a rational cropping pattern consistent with the national priorities. Another observation made in the repo rt in paragraph 162 is th at in r ecently against rainfed Under Prime Minister Rajat Gandhi's 20 point programme of 1986 a special programme has been launched in India to increase production and productivity in rainfed farming. Simultaneously efforts are being made for a viable technology package, a responsive extension service, and for a delivery system and pricing policy to diversify III of the paper, dealing with f inancing agricultural development, I was fascinated by the turn of the phrase in paragraph 224 that there have been signs of \"aid fatigue\" in some donor constituencies. On behalf of the developing countries, may I express the hope that this fatigue will be temporary and will be overcome agree paragraph both complements other economic sectors and also competes with them for financial resources. Yesterday, when the Director-General, Dr-Saouma, was referring to the financial state of the FAO which we shall be discussing here in the next few days, my mind went back to India where due to a sudden resource constraint an exercise expenditure. Predictably the cuts are likely to be heavy on agriculture, rural development and welfare programmes. We also agree with the findings about rural savings and agricultural investments. It is heartening to higher than such savings and once mobilized how to effectively channel them for agricultural progress and development. Referring to taxes on agriculture, it is true as observed in paragraph 240 that explicit taxation of agriculture is not a major source of revenue. The reasons for this situation are notfar to seek. In a country with a large majority engaged in agriculture, if one tries to keep the \"constituency\" satisfied the segment of the economy likely to be least taxed is agriculture. An off-shoot of this tendency is the policy towards land tax. More and more States in India are abolishing land tax, although in terms of incidence it has getting progressively light. A fall-out to this measure, however, which provide authentic proof about ownership tenure, mutations, etc., and which had to be kept up to date when land taxes were to in extending developmental credit to rural farmers based on security or pledge of the land. As regards the dualistic development strategy referred to in paragraph 245 and 246, and the explicit and implicit taxes, based on Indian experience permit me to differ from the view presented in the report. With a predominant and vocal lobby of agriculturalists it would be difficult to slap on implicit taxes which the farmers lobby would not become wise to in a matter of days, if not hours. On the other hand, there is a feeling that the agricultural sector is heavily subsidized. The fertilizer subsidy in India alone totals up to Rupees 2 billion per year. In flow irrigation from canals in Government projects the farmer pays precious little as an extra for a ccess to water, although the State invests an average of Rupees 37 500 per hectare to extend it. Similarly, power to agricultural pumpsets is supplied at rates which are one third to one quarter of the cost of generation and distribution. In another area of the report I find this aspect has been touched upon in a different context in paragraph 303. In this context we feel that the observations in paragraphe 245 and 246 do not seem to be applicable to the Indian situation. -82- As regards external sources as a means of funding agriculture it is gratifying to note that the OCA (Official Commitment to Agriculture) from the FAO as indicated in Table 13, page 55 is all concessional. May I express the hope on behalf of the developing countries that despite the be able to maintain the annual growth rate of 4. 8 percent. As far as foreign direct investment in agriculture is concerned, we in India have very little experience to be able to comment. However, the long assistance should ideally be, first, strengthening the infrastructure and extension service in the donee country. Secondly, to provide the necessary inputs in terms technology, fertilizers, and pesticides, etc., wherever required. Lastly, to build up science and research capabilities to innovate, adapt and improve what has been made available through external assistance programme. Against this background our delegation would support the suggestions made in paragraph 317, 318 and 319 of the document. May I conclude by saying that we eagerly look forward to the fuller report promised in paragraph 225 of the document. Guillermo Enrique GONZALEZ (Argentina):Siendo \u00e9sta la primera oportunidad en que mi delegaci\u00f3n hace uso de la palabra, quiero expresar mi satisfacci\u00f3n por verlo a usted nuevamente presidiendo nuestras deliberaciones. Felicito, asimismo, a nuestros tres vicepresidentes, que estoy seguro sabr\u00e1n ayudarle en su dif\u00edcil misi\u00f3n. Agrad ecemos tambi\u00e9n al Dr. Islam por la presentaci\u00f3n en la tarde de ayer que nos hiciera del documento pertinente para este tema. El mismo constituye un excelente an\u00e1lisis de la situaci\u00f3n actual de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n y, en general, mi delegaci\u00f3n coincide con sus apreciaciones y conclusiones, que estamos en condiciones de apoyar. He escuchado las excelentes intervenciones de los se\u00f1ores delegados y en este sentido deseo dejarconstancia de nuestra total coincidencia particularmente con lo expresado por los se\u00f1ores Gonzalo Bula Hoyos y Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez-Portillo, representantes de Colombia y M\u00e9xico, respectivamente. A fin de no extenderme en esta intervenci\u00f3n me referir\u00e9 s\u00f3lo a algunos de los aspectos m\u00e1s importantes para mi delegaci\u00f3n, pero en el entendimiento de que a los efectos de las estad\u00edsticas que suele llevar la Secretar\u00eda se cuente a mi delegaci\u00f3n apoyando lo dicho por los referidos representantes de Colombia y M\u00e9xico. Mi delegaci\u00f3n no puede dejar de reiterar los perniciosos efectos de las pol\u00edticas prot eccionistas, de la subvenci\u00f3n a las exportaciones y de las otras pr\u00e1cticas an\u00e1logas que algunos pa\u00edses industrializados llevan a cabo. Estas pol\u00edticas, miopes a nuestro juicio, est\u00e1n causando un da\u00f1o irreparable a pa\u00edses en desarrollo y particularmente a aquellos productores de bajo precio con vocaci\u00f3n ecol\u00f3gica que no s\u00f3lo hemos perdido mercados tradicionales, sino que debemos enfrentar hoy competencias desleales en terceros mercados. El sistema de promoci\u00f3n aplicado tiene adem\u00e1s, a nuestro juicio, caracter\u00edsticas en las que cabr\u00eda una consideraci\u00f3n a nivel moral. Se incentivan producciones que se sabe que son excedentarias ahora y en el futuro. Los agricultores siembran y cosechan sabiendo que s\u00f3lo el Estado absorber\u00e1 en buena parte los productos, y que parte de ellos terminar\u00e1n siendo destruidos. El sistema, evidentemente, ha avanzado de manera tal que ya casi no es sistema el riesgo comercial para muchos sectores agr\u00edcolas de pa\u00edses industrializados, pues \u00e9ste est\u00e1 cubierto, al menos en gran parte, por el Estado. Todo ello contrasta seriamente con la situaci\u00f3n y con los problemas de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo con sana vocaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola. All\u00ed se produce sin apoyos, sin subsidios, sin prot ecciones y, en defin itiva, siempre con la incertidumbre de saber si se podr\u00e1 vender. Por ello, cuando el documento que comentamos habla de la reducci\u00f3n y debilidad de los precios, de la disminuci\u00f3n y del crecimiento de la producci\u00f3n mundial y de las perspectivas futuras, croemos que ser\u00eda conveniente identificar y poner con mayor evidencia las causas de todo esto y las graves consecuencias que esas actividades tienen y tendr\u00e1n en forma creciente para el desarrollo de muchos pa\u00edses. -83- En lo, que concierne a la Argentina, estamos sufriendo con intensidad estos problemas afectando desde un punto de vista econ\u00f3mico y social a importantes \u00e1reas de nuestra poblaci\u00f3n rural. Es claro, Sr. Presidente, que nuestros pa\u00edses dif\u00edcilmente puedan continuar haciendo frente a los pesados servicios de la deuda externa si no se producen cambios importantes en esta materia, si nuestros productos no reciben un precio razonable, y en definitiva, si no se alcanza un orden econ\u00f3mico internacional m\u00e1s justo. Como resultado de los factores clim\u00e1ticos adversos y de l contexto internacional nega tivo, hubo en el per\u00edodo 1985- 86 una menor \u00e1rea sembrada en la Argentina y con rindes inferiores. Durante dicho ciclo agropecuario 1985-86 se experiment\u00f3 un descenso del 3, 4 por ciento general respecto ai ano precedente, atribuibles a un deterioro en la rama agr\u00edcola del-4, 1 por ciento y un leve ascenso en la pecuaria del 0, 6 por ciento. Este leve incremento que manifest\u00f3 el sector pecuario debe exclusivamente imputarse a la reactivaci\u00f3n de la producci\u00f3n l\u00e1ctea en un 5 por ciento, o sea, que los dem\u00e1s componentes reflejaron importantes declinaciones, que en el caso de ganado vacuno se debi\u00f3 a la forma en que ciertos pa\u00edses industrializados manejaron sus excedentes y que causaron el estancamiento y la descapitalizaci\u00f3n de todo el sector en Argentina. Durante el mencionado ciclo agr\u00edcola 1985-86, la producci\u00f3n triguera disminuy\u00f3 en un 27 por ciento respecto al a\u00f1o anterior, y en un 12, 9 por ciento respecto al \u00faltimo quinquenio, alcanzando un volumen por debajo de los 10 millones de toneladas. La producci\u00f3n de ma\u00edz, por el contrario, aument\u00f3 en un 25, 3 por ciento respecto al ciclo precedente y un 25, 5 respecto a la media del quinquenio, alcanzando un volumen del orden del 11, 9 milliones de toneladas. Esta cantidad que constituye un segundo r\u00e9cord hist\u00f3rico debe atribuirse en gran medida a un mayor rendimiento de la superficie cultivada que super\u00f3 los 3 560 kilogramos por hect\u00e1rea. La producci\u00f3n bruta de algod\u00f3n disminuy\u00f3 en un 8 por ciento respecto al a\u00f1o anterior, pero fue significativamentesuperior al promedio del \u00faltimo quinquenio. La uva para vinificar alcanz\u00f3 un volumen de 2, 2 millones de toneladas, lo que implica una sensible reducci\u00f3n en cualquier comparaci\u00f3n. Cabe se\u00f1alar, por \u00faltimo, que las previsiones para la presente campana 1986-87, no permiten ser muy optimistas como consecuencia directa de las crecientes dificultades en el contexto internacional que, l\u00f3gicamente, afectan a nuestros productores rurales. Confiamos en que este round de negociaciones que se abre en el seno del GATT. constituya un \"turning point\" de estas pol\u00edticas y estas tendencias que han caracterizado al comercio internacional en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y que, sin duda , hoy limitan severamente toda posibilidad de crecimiento en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo, profun-dizando as\u00ed el problema de la pobreza. Es por ello, Sr. Presidente, que con todo entusiasmo midelegaci\u00f3n apoya la iniciativa del Presidente Virgilio Barco de Colombia para librar una verdadera batalla contra el flagelo de la pobreza extrema. Por \u00faltimo, reiteramos tambi\u00e9n nuestro respaldo a la cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica y econ\u00f3mica entre los pa\u00edses en desarrollo en el campo de la agricultura y a la labor de coordinaci\u00f3n y apoyo que estamos seguros la Organizaci\u00f3n puede prestar. Dominic D. BALLAYAN (Liberia): My delegation highly commends the FAO secretariat for preparation of documents CL 90/2 and its sup 1; we are also pleased with the comprehensive picture presented on food, agriculture, fishery and trade. excellent previews to our deliberation, and it is our that we will amicably reach unanimous consensus in resolving some of the pressing organization on agricultural and rural development. -84- Althoughthe increase in food production shows more modest progress in 1986 than in 1985, and even shows significant recovery specifically in some developing countries, my delegation is displeased of threat of food shortage or starvation still confronting some of the regions of the world, especially those of Africa, as we see in paragraph 31 of document CL 90/2 Sup 1. We therefore support paragraph 36 of Sup 1 and its sub items in this line. My delegation will not dwell on impediments to food production and economic growth in all regions facing malnutrition, starvation or even death since many have elaborated on these issues. Moreover, we are aware of these calamities some of which causes are natural and unnatural, or internal and external. My delegation is appealing to and other organizations and donors to continue giving both moral and financial support to all initiatives put forward by the Director-General and FAO in fully achieving better agriculture performance in those regions facing starvation. We must support the ideal of an in-depth study of African agriculture with respect to aid in kind as we feel this may remedy some of our immediate problems in promoting agriculture recovery. Furthermore, there are the region producing surpluses, and my delegation feels that with this study of aid-in-kind, donor nations may be able to purchase these surpluses to be used as aid to other food deficit countries. We also agree that aid-in-kind that technical cooperation warning systems are key areas that deserve unanimous support for they have continued to play an effective role in handling some of the worst food problems in Africa and other developing African countries are receiving moral and financial aid, to continue giving agriculture high priority, and in that respect supports paragraph 300 of CL Chairman, my delegation is gratified to see you chairing this 90th Session of FAO Council and we congratulate those Vice-Chairmen elected to aid you guide our deliberations in the cause of FAO's future and including suffering humanity. Robert SEVCOVIC (Czechoslovakia): Mr Chairman, since this is the first time my delegation has taken the floor, I should like to follow up on some of the principal problems to which the Director-General has drawn our attention. As for our position on all the secretariat documents prepared for consideration in the Council, we should like to express a tribute for the generally thorough preparation of these documents. Document CL 90/2 is undoubtedly of fundamental importance. Together with document it provides a relatively balanced and well-rounded overview of world food and agricultural situation. It has already become a matter of tradition as well as of FAO's prestige that the Organization's statistics, analyses and other documents on the food situation offer a valuable source of information to Member Governments on the state and development of world output and consumption of food. However, what the documents on the world food situation lack, in our view, is a more profound socio-economic and political look at this set of problems. Whereas we live at a time when the world stocks of cereals have surpassed by several percentage points the recommended size of stocks for world food security and, at the same time, three-quarters of a billion people suffer from hunger and malnutrition, this situation may rightly be called a paradox and the food problem may gravest developing countries the longer developing countries the agricultural output, the redistribution of food and agricultural products, their consumption as well as trade with them are highly vulnerable. Neither the current situation nor the positive trends in to the development of interest rates and inflation. As the document states, in our view correctly, certain encouraging trends in the world economy be a grave mistake to overestimate their significance, particularly with regard to their impact on the development of agriculture. All the more urgently arises the need for an analysis of the broader socio-economic aspects of the food problem. We regard the food problem as a special form underdevelopment of technical, demographic, as as political, aspects of the and consumption of foodstuffs. Despite some positive shifts that have occurred of national agricultural policies in many developing countries, not only in Asia but also, as the document states, in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, the problem of hunger and malnutrition remains a pressing one in many other countries, particularly the least developed ones. It is precisely this trend that we consider to be extremely unfavourable and we are gravely concerned about the continuous growth of the disproportions between the level of agricultural development in the advanced countries and in the least developed ones. The an outbreak of starvation in many parts of the world date back to the period before the gaining of political independence by the majority of today's developingcountries. We are entitled to ask:what stands today in the way of solving the food problem?We are convinced that the problem successfully tackled and solved without an overall restructuring of the whole system of international economic relations on a democratic basis and without the establishment of a new international economic order. The economic and, as a result, frequently also political dependence centres, the continuing exploitation of the human and natural resources of the developing countries along with a number of other neocolonialist practices and the unjust and unequal division of labour between the developed capitalist states and the developing countries in the field of food production represent a serious hindrance to the economic development of the developing countries. This division of labour is imposed on the developing countries by the international market mechanism and by the of the transnational corporations. Very often a situation arises which a produces not what is urgently needed by its inhabitants but what is in demand on the world market. The priorities of that market are the decisive and determining factor in relation to the vast majority of the liberated territories. At the same time, the impact of that market leads in many cases to a distortion of the production profile of many countries and has thus a considerable share in the complicated situation in developing countries. In enumerating the and the interrelations of the food problem it would be a mistake not to mention the impact of bad weather on agriculture and on poor crops. The document contains a sober and, at the same time, matter-of-fact assessment of the consequences of the rains in Africa and the Middle East which followed the disastrous droughts of the first half of the 1980s. This year in particular FAO has been giving particular attenion to the problem of locusts and grasshopper attacks in Africa and in the Middle East, and it has already undertaken a number of steps towards the solution of these problems. The common denominator of the climatic and natural factors is the fact that neither is insurmountable. We are convinced that their impact can be mitigated if the right agricultural policy is designed and. implemented. It is necessary to see the of such economic programmes that would utilize both other resources, closely match the reconstruction of obsolete agriculture with the activities of other economic branches, with decisive assistance being provided by the state, which plays an irreplaceable role in economic development. Today agricultural development also represents a broad field of activity involving operational and technical assistance including the transfer of technologies and know-how. We believe that this aspect of the development of agriculture would deserve greater attention in the document. -86- As far as the evaluation of the situation of agriculture in the region as well as individual countries is concerned, we are of the view that document CL/90/2 assesses the situation on the whole objectively and in a balanced manner. With regard to the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic it should perhaps be added to the stated evaluation tha t in the course of the last two years Czechoslovakia not only managed to reach self-sufficiency in the output of cereals but also, at the same time, to fully satisfy the demand for meat and dairy products and to produce also certain surpluses which have been exported to other countries of the world. The Czechoslovak delegation is convinced that in order to overcome the current food situation it is important for a number of developing countries to strengthen their over their the activities of the transnational corporations, to increase the share of the state and cooperative sectors in agriculture, to utilize their own food resources and the experience of those developing countries which have succeeded in reaching self-sufficiency in staplee food stuffs, and to strengthen their regional independence in food. We are deeply concerned about the unprecedented financial situation in FAO, especially in light of the shortfall in resources caused by delayed or reduced payments from the largest contributors. The social and economic development of the developing countries in the broadest sense is related to progress in international negotiations on securing universal peace, gradual reduction of military budgets and disarmament. My country will continue, as to assistance as well as its tried and tested experience from the development of state and cooperative sectors in agriculture. We have again a great deal of valuable experience in that respect, and we have successfully resolved the question of self-sufficiency in the output of principal agricultural commodities. As a founding and long-standing member of FAO, continue to provide aid to the developing countries and to give support to their demands aimed at attaining their independence in food. Javed MUSHARRAF (Pakistan): The most striking aspect of this commendable document and of the deliberations that ensued on it have been to highlight, (as stated in paragraph 4 of the document) how an essentially external factor, namely the overall economic environment of the world, can exert an influence on agricultural production and trade comparable to the factors and policies within the sector itself. The inter-dependence between the various parts of the world have been pointed out by everyone--the massive chain (to quote the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia) linking South and North in the matter of growth and trade etc. At the cost of over-simplification, I would like to confine my intervention to a cursory look at the relation of the developing to the developed countries as a whole (labelled as North and South) and what prospects the South can be said to have for growth, development and for trade in a world that has come to be organized along North/South lines--a world in which growth and trade have stalled and protectionism and indebtedness have become endemic. In a way, I would like to start where the delegate of Turkey left off in a statement on this item yesterday when he said that we in the South seem to be getting the advice that, \"since the neighbourhood has gone a bit awry, put your own house in order\". The delegate of Turkey went on to say, and one would like to ask, \"What about the neighbourhood? Doesn't the neighbourhood affect the household well?\" In statement I would like to explore, in a wider and longer context than focused in our discussions, the relationship between that household and that neighborhood. What it perhaps is, what it might be, and what it may mean for trade, growth and development. -87- The bleak the Director-General in a length by almost every delegation. Therefore, without repeating that part of the picture, I will confine my comments to, and remind the delegates of, certain not unknown broad and general aspects of a global and historical nature against which the overall prospects and tasks before the developing countries arising from the documents have already been gone into, I wish to address a few broader, and I hope not too trivial, or irrelevant, aspects. It has commonly been accepted that growth in the developed parts of the world acted, through the mechanism of trade, as the engine of growth, pulling the less developed countries ahead on the growth path. Now, as we are informed by this document, that engine seems to have run out of steam. The question, and an important one for us, therefore, is when is the engine likely to speed up again? And what will happen if it does not?Can the \"train\" of developed countries keep going forward fast enough under its own steam or momentum?Looking at the first of these questions, namely when is the engine likely to speed up again, no one can be so bold or rash as to say definitely when. One may, however, perhaps look at the historical record in awareness, of course, of any rigid \"historicism\". Over the last 200 years or so there have been with a striking, (and not fully explained) regularity, four long periods or cycles of or so-the second half of each cycle of twenty to twenty-five years being the downswing or depression. The four periods of depression, one may recall, were: firstly the 1830s and 40s, (those 25 years); then again from 1873 to the end of the 19th century which came to be called 'The Long Depression'; thirdly, the \"Great Depression\" of the late 20s and 30s of this century; and, finally, this one since the last decade (and if one date is to be given--maybe since 1973). The question is, will it go on to the end of the century?Who can say?Whether what we have at present is \"long or such in case a sham (like the Babylonian exercises in numerology) is a matter for nervous speculation. On the second question, namely what will happen if growth does not a ccelerate? One may recall and take heart from the fact that Germany, France, and the USA had developed their industry during the \"long\" depression in the end of the 19th century. Later, Japan, USSR, Canada, and Australia industrialized during the \"great\" of century. Therefore (with caution again, given the historical and other differences ) develop during the and have an autonomous engine growth to ultimately pull the stalling engine of the North and then both engines might work together in tandem? Are the tropical countries too hot (in climate) to develop? Are people too lazy and unenterprising? One may dismiss all such prophecies by remembering how, a few centuries ago, Ibu Khaldun, the Tunisian philosopher (from your country, Mr Chairman), perhaps the most original historiographer of all times, had declared that Europe could never develop since it was too cold. But at that very time, the Renaissance was about to surface in Europe. The safest bit of speculation is that people anywhere, at all times, of all cultures and climes, have the equal potential given the right circumstances, environment, policies and so on. To point to one historical episode, there was, in fact, an incipient industrial revolution in Bengal when the British came to India. Had it not been thwarted through colonial commercial policy, the history and position of what is now Bangladesh could have been very different. Thus, an optimistic answer to the second question (and we do seem to need under this Agenda item a dose of optimism), is that it can in principle be done i. e. an autonomous, independent growth -88- momentum for the South (independent of the North), should be possible -- the mechanism for South / South, and. South/South arrangements. The developing countries can, in fact, import their food, their fertilizers, their cement, their steel, their machines from other developing countries and make their own later. Some developing countries, the fast-growing ones, can, to start with, take the position of the present developed countries as. the engine of growth to pull the rest along. Preferential arrangements, however, on a global South/South level will have to be worked out, or perhaps a more restricted \"customs that route had not fulfilled its earlier promise). The really difficult position, of course, for some time to come will be that of the \"least developed\" countries. For them, special support a rrangements and frameworks will have to be n ecessary -- in-cluding, in particular, aid during the transition period. Internally, the developing countries organizational and policy making capacities as late developers amongst the developed countries, such as Japan. They will have to reduce their technological dependence and embark on a rapid personnel, even avoiding perhaps foreign investments in their major industries. Even a little \"turning-in\" the reduction of too much interdependence, at least for some time, may be called for. Some of the leading developing countries are already embarked on that route. The others have to be sucked in, as it were, into this age-old process, through South/South cooperation (what we now call ECDC/TCDC). Of course there are complicating factors not experienced before by the earlier late developers. For example, the existence of the transnational corporations. In a world in which two-fifths of world trade is conducted by transnational corporations and their subsidiaries, where developing country of food and technology are controlled by transnational corporations, and a world in which the exports of these countries are controlled by, or dependent for their market access upon, these corporations, it may be difficult to change flows from the current North/South pattern to new South/ South routes. To take some UNCTAD figures, corporate control of the global commodity trade is such that in 1980 a handful of transnational traders, (as few as four or five in each case) accounted for 60 percent of the sugar market; 70 percent of bananas, rice and natural rubber; 80 percent of tea; 85 percent of wheat, coffee, corn, cotton, rubber, cocoa, pineapple; and 90 percent of forest products. There are, of course, both positive and negative aspects of the role of the transnational corporations. One cannot, and should not, paint things black and white. It depends on the specifics of the situation and the type of arrangements worked out with them. There is a need for terms and agree with the delegate from Mexico when he proposed yesterday that there is an urgent need for a study by this Organization on the role of trans-national corporations and their position in the world trade of commodities. In addition to the transnational corporations, factors facing developing countries. To cite only one is the reverse flow of technology called the \"Brain Drain\". Having briefly at, as above, some aspects pos ition on the side of the developing countries, one may now turn to the side of the developed countries and ask, \"What can or should the North be (hopefully) expected to do?\"Perhaps the answer is two things: first, put its own house in order; second open its windows; and if one may add a third, even help the less developed countries to put their house in order, including their efforts at South/South cooperation. In the matter of putting their own house in order, the developed countries should tackle their own \"structural\" pending reliable research, be at the root cause of their present crisis). Their crisis is, in some respects, \"structural\" (apart from, or in addition to, being \"cyclical\"). over-capacity in what are called \"ailing industries\", as motorcars, shipyards, steel and due to technological and economic reasons. For example, in the case of steel, development of substitutes, use of lighter construction materials, saturation of -89- such a structural situation, recovery of the overall demand when the general recession is overmay still not be enough to restore the demand for such industries. Their malaise cyclical. The answer therefore is \"structural adjustment\", something which in many respects is easier capacity to adjust. Their capacity to adjust is more limited. Even if the will is there, the capacity to respond and to adapt is less. The domestic expenditure and to \"reposition\" themselves, as it were, in new directions at high cost in terms of austerity. All this is far more difficult for an underdeveloped country with underdeveloped organizations situation, however, are that the structural have over time to (through perhaps a perverse form of development), become regional problems as well, with regional, political and economic dimensions. Whole regions have become specialized in some of the The regionalization brought about by, I believe, an historical process of a few large themselves in a locality, sucking in all the labour and factors of production into its vortex, and driving out other industries and activities from the locality. The original local networks of economic were it were, (literally in some places, figuratively in many more). Once situation be like trying to replant still, it need may see fit to have the IMF assist them in this respect. As regards the second task of the developed countries, namely what I referred to as the windows\", both morality and mutual interest dictate the doing away with protectionism -- \"morality\", from the point of view of alleviating human suffering in the developing countries (granted that morality has never cut much ice since Adam, Abel and Cain), but \"mutual interest\" should countries. Of course, in the long run, it may be true (as was said by Arthur Lewis) that even if the whole Third World sinks under the sea, it will really not make any difference to the \"North\". But that will be in the long run. In the short, or medium run, as Brandt has pointed out, plainly there is a mutuality of interest. The delegate of Colombia has quoted leaders of the North, Mr. Craxi, MrPandolfi, and members of delegations who attended the recent Punta del Este meeting as saying that it was not just an act of humanitarianism but one necessary to achieve economic balance and peace in the world and so on. Yet all such declarations have never led to action. What is the explanation for this puzzle? Neither \"morality\" nor \"mutual interest to cut I think the explanation lies in the politico-economic facts they might be in the \"general\" interest, the \"general\" interest. Now that explanation has to be grasped and acted upon because it has implications for policy and how the matter is to be approached. Even in the 19th Century when free trade was accepted in Britain, and in the post-First World War free trade period in the USA, it was \"particular\" interests which had spurred action in the direction of both; \"particular\" interests of industry and trade in Britain in the 19th Century and \"particular\" interests of industry and trade in the United States in the post war period had led to free tradism. But now the powerful \"particular\" interests will have to be watered down and perhaps one has to use other methods in approaching these particular interests. The approach that can be taken is a sort of \"bargaining approach\" where the be to In fact, are where in the recent past this has worked. several member countries sitting here, without naming any. In one a restriction on textile exports was su of orders of textile machinery. In the case of another pair of countries, a better treatment for the students of one country were sort of \"extracted\" through a boycott of that country's goods. In the case of another set of countries, an IDA replenishment was facilitated when one country threatened to withhold certain major contracts in order to get the support of another country for the replenishment. -90- In the case of yet another set the reduced grain purchases led to the removal of restrictions on textile imports. And so on. The is of course, such bargaining methods and distorting effect, may escalate economic wars, and may really be further in the nature \"beggar-thy-neighbour\" policies. The possibility of retaliation and so on would also be there. But it would not be the worst off policy in every case. In a situation which is already not the first-best or the second-best, but perhaps the the improve situation, as indeed in the examples where I cited it did. Another example of a worthwhile second best policy, which would be bad in a free trade situation but would be all right in a protectionist environment, is the example of counter trade (now accounting for almost 20 percent of total trade). So the point is that second-or third-best policy, in an the use of such an approach. But then the answer is collective bargaining. But, of course, caution has to be exercised in all this, as it may lead to situations where ultimately everyone is be predicted in individual situations. Therefore there is a need to play by the ear but best, of course, to avoid it altogether, that is approach of \"bargaining\" and \"beggar-thy-neighbour\" policies. For this the initiative, of course, lies with those who hold the cards, namely, the developed countries. Finally, since it is already too long, to touch upon the third aspect which the developed countries could do, namely try to promoteSouth-South cooperation, the North could try to promote this South/ South cooperation through technical the necessary structural adjustments through assistance for human resources development and through the creation of infrastructure and information networks which would facilitate true South/South cooperation. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Aunque en primer lugar debemos expresar nuestro apoyo al informe en discusi\u00f3n, quiero comenzar por manifestar mi congratulaci\u00f3n al doctor Islam por la eficiente labor que revela este informe, y asimismo debemos expresar aqu\u00ed algunas reflexiones a que nos han movido el estudio de ese informe. Este informe pone en evidencia de manera clara una nueva realidad, la interdependencia econ\u00f3mica, independientemente de las posiciones ideol\u00f3gicas y pol\u00edticas de los pa\u00edses en referencia. La interdependencia, sin duda, es un concepto nuevo que supera aquel cuadro tradicional de los pa\u00edses dominantes y pa\u00edses dependientes en el plano internacional, ciertamente, en el hecho subsistente por una diferencia en cuanto a la capacidad productiva de unos y las necesidades de otros. Hoy tenemos, por cierto gracias al Sistema de las Naciones Unidas, y muy en especial de esta Organizaci\u00f3n para la Agricultura y la Alimentaci\u00f3n en la cual estas relaciones pueden ser discutidas en el plano multilateral, una oportunidad en que todo puede ser discutido sin mengua de la soberan\u00eda de los pa\u00edses pobres, o como algunos los denominan pa\u00edses subdesarrollados o pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo. Esta interdependencia significa que no pueden subsistir pa\u00edses capaces de bastarse a s\u00ed mismos sin estar aislados de la Comunidad Internacional, por m\u00e1s poderosos que ellos sean pol\u00edtica y econ\u00f3micamente. Los dominantes sin duda necesitan la solidaridad y las relaciones externas que es la base para llegar a su posici\u00f3n con base a la producci\u00f3n y necesitan adem\u00e1s quienes consuman esta producci\u00f3n; esto es, necesitan un mercado. Es este justamente el punto que nos conduce al problema de la ayuda alimentaria, problema que concierne a la FAO y al cual se refiere el informe que hoy debemos aprobar. Y es este problema el que ha dado lugar al nuevo concepto de seguridad alimentaria, el cual no debe considerarse de otra manera que no sea el cumplimiento de la responsabilidad de velar por la supervivencia de poblaciones que por m\u00faltiples razones no disponen de medios propios para atender sus n ecesidades de supervivencia. Estas poblaciones son dependientes de tal ayuda alimentaria que n ecesariamente debe venir de aquellas naciones privilegiadas, por decirlo as\u00ed, -91- privilegiadas por la naturaleza, por su situaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica, su clima y, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no decirlo tambi\u00e9n?porque el devenir hist\u00f3rico les ha permitido las condiciones pol\u00edtico-sociales propicias para su desarrollo cultural mientras que a los otros les han sido negadas las condiciones m\u00ednimas para la superaci\u00f3n de su atraso y las posibilidades de acceder a otros estadios del desarrollo, o lo que es lo mismo medido en t\u00e9rminos modernos, la capacidad de producir para autoabastecer sus necesidades esenciales. Si analizamos este hecho de la interdependencia nos preguntamos: \u00bfpodr\u00edan subsistir, podr\u00edan haber alcanzado el desarrollo que hoy ostentan los pa\u00edses industrializados, es decir los principales productores, sin haber tenido un mercado para sus productos y que, en consecuencia, son sus clientes consumidores?. No son precisamente los pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo, los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo, unos porque es de aqu\u00e9llos de quienes dependen para el intento de desarrollo de su agricultura y su industria, otros, los del Tercer Mundo, porque precisamente gracias a este programa de la ayuda alimentaria han encontrado una oportunidad para que de una manera muy eficiente puedan disponer de sus excedentes, en suma los pa\u00edses desarrollados son tambi\u00e9n beneficiarios de este Programa de Ayuda Alimentaria. Es, pues, un juego de intereses el que se produce en esta relaci\u00f3n de interdependencia, en el cual la parte d\u00e9bil es la de los que por efectos del subdesarrollo han llegado a unos niveles de pobreza extrema de los cuales es dif\u00edcil, y ser\u00e1 muy dif\u00edcil, levantarse sin la cooperaci\u00f3n de todos, y es precisamente este el programa de mayor excelencia que posee la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentaci\u00f3n es decir la FAO, que con sus programas de cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica cumple de un modo eficiente esa tarea de asistencia a los miembros de la Organizaci\u00f3n que aspiran a mejorar sus condiciones de vida y de supervivencia; por ello queremos dejar constancia de manera expresa muy en especial nuestro respaldo a la permanencia de este Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica del cual tantos beneficios derivan los pa\u00edses pobres. Asimismo queremos apoyar la idea expresada en este Consejo por nuestro Director General, doctor Saouma, para extender este Programa de Ayuda Alimentaria, para que incluya adem\u00e1s de alimentos insumos tales como semillas, fertilizantes, maquinaria, etc. al mismo tiempo que el Programa pueda extender su cobertura no s\u00f3lo al Continente Africano, sino al Medio Oriente, a Asia y Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. Ser\u00eda de esta manera la forma en que la ayuda alimentaria y la coordinaci\u00f3n de esta ayuda alimentaria con el desarrollo de estos pa\u00edses pudi era ser realmente efectiva. Queremos ratificar aqu\u00ed la posici\u00f3n de Venezuela expresada en la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas frente al proteccionismo agr\u00edcola y otros medios de descr iminaci\u00f3n contra los pa\u00edses en desarrollo que son exportadores de productos b\u00e1sicos. Finalmente, porque quiero ser breve, debo recordar que est\u00e1 pendiente el estudio hace tiempo solicitado sobre las corporaciones transnacionales que no ha sido presentado todav\u00eda. Quiero apoyar la solicitud de la delegaci\u00f3n mexicana sobre este punto a fin de que sea conocido tal documento. Y por \u00faltimo, queremos dejar constancia del apoyo de Venezuela ya expresado por nuestro Canciller en el foro de las Naciones Unidas a la proposici\u00f3n del Presidente de Colombia sobre la Conferencia sobre la probreza absoluta a realizarse en fecha pr\u00f3xima. No quiero agregar nada m\u00e1s porque todo lo han dicho quienes me antecedieron en el uso de la palabra. Haris ZANNETIS (Observer for Cyprus): Being an observer and following so many statements I will be very brief. Nevertheless I would like to express my delegation's satisfaction for the comprehensive document and its supplements and to commend Professor Islam for his introduction. The state of food and agricultu re in 1986 in general can be said to repres ent a positive picture. Production of cereals and other major foodstuffs increased globally. What is more important is the even distribution of this increase between developed and developing countries. As a result of this increase in production carry-over stocks are rising and world prices are dropping. This by itself would have been a factor if developing countries, importantly the poorest of them, -92- were financially able to import the food that they need. But the ever growing burden of debt servicing of these countries their agricultural balance of payments financial resources of these countries, making it increasingly difficult for them to finance commercial inputs. The result is the reduction of food availability in these countries and the reduction in per caput food consumption. This brings me to paragraph 52 of the present document, where we read with concern that in thecountries with relatively high levels countries with the lowest levels of DES. This is very worrying and represents, we believe, the major tasks for the international community. Massive efforts should would be helped to be able to produce or import the food they need for their people. We recognize that efforts have been made but perhaps they should be intensified. We conceded the agreement reached early this year for the second replenishment of IFAD's resources to be a positive step. Although the agreed level of resources is our it will neverthless enable the Fund to be operative for a few more years. We hope that negotiations for the aid replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association will aso be sucessful and resources will keep flowing through this body for the agricultural development of less developed countries. Mrs Malgorzata PIOTROWSKA (Observer for cannot be neutral on the point raised this morning by the Australian delegation. The future leadership of FAO is of extreme importance to member countries. We fully agreed with the Chairman, who decided that a discussion on this subject was out of order at that time. It was the reason why we did not raise our hand in protest and since we are here in the observer capacity. However, we cannot miss the opportunity to express our full support for Dr Saouma. The very difficult situation that FAO is facing now calls for the best man with a lot of experience to Bead the Organization. Dr. Saouma proved to be such a man. The interests of the Organization requirethat we profit from his knowledge and experience during his further term of office. Coming back to the item on the agenda, I would like to Say that an analysis of the document under discussion indicates that i t correctly reflects the progress in world agricultural production and in the rural life of most continents. The favourable trend of production and rural development growth in most countries of Asia, South America, socialist countries and some Africa countries is being consolidated. Also Poland food self-sufficiency has restored unjust North/South. In part of the developing countries, particularly part African countries, the agricultural food situation is aggravated dramatically without a real outlook for averting that dangerous trend. It is emphasized rightly in the document that a reason equally important as the drought, and maybe more important, is the worsening credit relations between South and North and insufficiently effective aid granted to those countries. exchange exercise stronger checking effect on the agriculture of developing countries and the international aid programmes can act favourably. Also there is increasingly subsidized food production. It brings out ever growing economic social problems, not only in the agricultural environment but also among the consumer. The reluctance of taxpayers is also growing. On the other hand it also hinders the export of agricultural raw materials and food supluses on the part of developing countries. All the above indicates that there is necessary radicalization of thinking of the international community and of our Organization in this respect. New ways and instruments have to be found for regulating production and for improving rural development by single countries, groups of countries, FAO and other organizations dealing with problems. Such that approach to the difficult problems of world agriculture can be the recent in itiative of the Director-General on agricultural development of Africa. Poland welcomes that initiative with appreciation and satisfaction. It will be important for the future aid, the acknowledgement of the need and the acceptance of the possib ility of assistance in kind that facilitate to may countries, Poland included, a wider aid programmes to other countries. -93- Poland expects that the FAO Council will devote considerable attention to the working out of effective forms of mobilization and use of the assistance in kind, which is more difficult that mobilization, and particular spending resources in cash which has been dominating so far. The programme \"Africa\" also synthesises the experiences of the past years of the expert work of FAO and the instruction of specific features of the countries such as minor traditional of consumption and technologies of food preparing in households in social areas, women's role etc., which might increase effectiveness of both multilateral and bilateral assistance. Difficult problems of world agriculture, its dependence on conditions of general and trade development, make it necessary for FAO to join, especially, actively the new round of GATT. Without progress in improving general conditions of exchange there can be no improvement in the agricultural and food situation, not only in Africa but in Europe as well. Poland expects the FAO Council to handle those issues with great care and activity in the coming years. By way of conclusion, let me emphasize the satisfaction that in the document under discussion the agricultural questions of socialist countries were treated with more insight than they have been in the previous report of the State of Food and Agriculture. We wish to thank Mr Hjort and his colleagues for so cooperative an approach and for efforts undertaken to provide the Council with an objective picture of the Polish agriculture. We are willing to cooperate with respective services in the future in improving those analyses. Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Es para m\u00ed un honor asistir por primera vez a este 90\u00b0 Consejo de la FAO. Nos complace mucho, se\u00f1or Presidente, verle presidir nuestros trabajos, al intervenir a pr\u00f3posito del tema 4 de nuestra agenda sobre la situaci\u00f3n mundia l en la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n, tema sin duda dificil en los tiempos que corren. El Sr. Director General de la FAO en la sesi\u00f3n inaugural destac\u00f3 en breve s\u00edntesis la situaci\u00f3n mundial poniendo \u00e9nfasis, en opini\u00f3n de mi delegaci\u00f3n, en los problemas de comercio que, sin duda, cobran crucial importancia en estos momentos. Poseemos para nuestros trabajos una buena herramienta en el interesante y valioso documento de la Secretar\u00eda CL 90/2 presentado acertadamente por el Dr. Nurul Islam. El Sr. Director General nos ha complementado su texto haciendo referencia a las tendencias actuales en torno al proteccionismo, agregando una nota de moderado op timismo que genera el inicio de una nueva ronda de negociaciones del GATT comenzada con los acuerdos de Punta del Este. Seguimos, por cierto, muy atentamente tales negociaciones y, en especial, en materia silvoagropnecuaria, complaciendo a mi delegaci\u00f3n el anuncio de la contribuci\u00f3n que de la FAO para el \u00e9xito de las mismas. Mi pa\u00eds cree firmemente en que la decidida liberalizaci\u00f3n del comercio agr\u00edcola y el consiguiente crecimiento del mismo traer\u00e1 beneficios para todos y ser\u00e1, asimismo, una verdadera contribuci\u00f3n a la cooperaci\u00f3n y a la paz mundial. Al igual que otros pa\u00edses presentes, creemos en los esfuerzos en estas materias. Cabe recordar respecto al problema de las barreras al comercio que, seg\u00fan revelara un reciente estudio del Banco Mundial, el proteccionismo agr\u00edcola en arroz, carnes, productos l\u00e1cteos y az\u00facar reduce el ingreso nacional tanto de los pa\u00edses desarrollados como de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Estos \u00faltimos pierden por este concepto 18 billones de d\u00f3lares al a\u00f1o y los desarrollados 46 billones en el mismo per\u00edodo. Dem\u00e1s est\u00e1 decir, Sr. Presidente, que mi pa\u00eds particip\u00f3 decididamente en los acuerdos adoptados en las reuniones celebradas en los pa\u00edses en los que no se subvencionan sus producciones agropecuarias, que tuvieron lugar en Pattaya (Tailandia) y en la ciudad australiana de Cairns en julio y agosto del a\u00f1o en curso, respectivamente. Debo se\u00f1alar al Consejo que en mi pa\u00eds la balanza comerc ial arroj\u00f3 en 1985 un super\u00e1 vit de 586 y medio millones de d\u00f3lares, es decir, 67, 5 por ciento superior al a\u00f1o precedente, a lo cual cabe agregar otro super\u00e1vit en el sector de la pesca por 500 millones de la misma moneda. Pero de igual fo rma, el informe de la Secretar\u00eda nos alerta por el deterioro de los t\u00e9rminos de intercambio que llegar\u00eda al orden del 3 por ciento en el a\u00f1o reci\u00e9n pasado y que afecta por igual a todos los pa\u00edses. -94- Tambi\u00e9n, a pesar de que la CEPAL estima en su estudio sobre el \"Panorama Econ\u00f3mico en Am\u00e9rica Latina\" que las exportaciones chilenas crecieron un 19 por ciento, es motivo de reflexi\u00f3n la tendencia mundial negativa que menciona la Secretar\u00eda en cuanto a vol\u00famenes exportados (en el p\u00e1rrafo 13), especialmente si consideramos que se nos indica que para Am\u00e9rica Latina hubo un descenso del 1, 2 por ciento. Es asimismo inquietante la tendencia a una mayor baja que se observa en los precios de productos silviagropecuarios en relaci\u00f3n a los manufacturados, variable que nos obligar\u00e1 a ser particularmente atentos respecto a los factores que generan tal situaci\u00f3n. De gran inter\u00e9s para mi delegaci\u00f3n ha sido, Sr. Presidente, examinar el Informe en lo relativo a los sectores de pesca y silvicultura en los cuales se cita a mi pa\u00eds como de aquellos ribere\u00f1os en el Pac\u00edfico sudoriental en los cuales la pesca ha crecido (en el p\u00e1rrafo 72). En tal sentido quisiera expresar ante este Consejo que los 5 millones de toneladas desembarcadas por mi pa\u00eds representan el 13 por ciento de las exportaciones. Es interesante agregar que en mi patria la tasa de crecimiento del sector pesquero es en los cinco \u00faltimos a\u00f1os del 14 por ciento anual situ\u00e1ndose por cierto como primer pa\u00eds pesquero cuyas capturas tienen lugar dentro de su propia zona econ\u00f3mica exclusiva. Tambi\u00e9n mi delegaci\u00f3n ha visto con detenci\u00f3n el cap\u00edtulo dedicado a las pol\u00edticas de ajuste y el sector agr\u00edcola en el decenio de 1980 contenido en los p\u00e1rrafos 138 y siguientes, que se refiere a Am\u00e9rica Latina. Mi delegaci\u00f3n observa con alg\u00fan desconsuelo que en este p\u00e1rrafo se ha mencionado por ejemplo los programas nutricionales que se han suspendido y reanudado, pero que no se haya considerado una alusi\u00f3n de est\u00edmulo para aquellos que pese a cualquier contingencia han sido mantenidos en el tiempo, como el caso de mi pa\u00eds. Puesto que estamos apoyando la Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentaci\u00f3n, especialmente en este \u00faltimo aspecto de la alimentaci\u00f3n, nos complacer\u00eda mucho ver en los documentos de esta naturaleza algunos ant ecedentes sobre la evoluci\u00f3n de los \u00edndices nutricionales m\u00e1s importantes. Para completar este documento CL 90/2, mi delegaci\u00f3n tiene el placer de poner en conocimiento del Consejo que en Chile el \u00edndice de nutrici\u00f3n escasa baj\u00f3 del 15, 5 por ciento en 1975 a un 8, 1 por ciento en 1985. Por otra parte, el \u00edndice de nutrici\u00f3n seria baj\u00f3 de un 0, 7 por ciento a un 0, 1 por ciento en el mismo per\u00edodo. El notable repunte del nivel nutricional se tradujo por ejemplo en una impresionante baja en los \u00edndices de mortalidad infantil, partiendo de un 95, 4 pro mil en 1965 baj\u00f3 a un 55, 4 por mil en 1975 y a s\u00f3lo un 20 por mil en 1984. En el documento CL 90/2 apreciamos asimismo el p\u00e1rrafo 3 relativo al financiamiento del desarrollo agr\u00edcola y en especial la letra \"c\" referente al uso de los fondos. Sin embargo, ya en el Consejo Mundial de Alimentaci\u00f3n mi pa\u00eds expuso sus reservas respecto al exagerado significado que en algunos sitios se tiende a da r a ciertos par\u00e1metros tales como el gasto p\u00fablico en el sector silvoagropecua-rio, que no nos parece un \u00edndice significativo ni valedero para medir la dedicaci\u00f3n de un pa\u00eds al sector social y agr\u00edcola, debiendo prestarse tal vez m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n a los resultados y muy especialmente a los conceptos m\u00e1s modernos, como es el del porcentaje del gasto social en el presupuesto, que coadyuva a entender mejor el efectivo apoyo en \u00e1reas rurales en pro de los sectores de poblaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s necesitados. Tengo el honor de informar a este Consejo que en mi pa\u00eds este porcentaje del gasto social en el presupuesto, excluido el servicio de la deuda, se ha elevado de un 40 por ciento en 1970 a un 5 por ciento en el a\u00f1o 1980, y al 57, 9 por ciento en 1985. Este ga sto se utiliza principalmente en salud, asistencia social, previsi\u00f3n, educaci\u00f3n y desarrollo regional en un proceso calificado como exitoso en el reciente informe del Banco Mundial sobre la pobreza en Am\u00e9rica Latina y al cual agradecemos su dedicaci\u00f3n y tendencia innovadora en esta materia social tan importante para mi Gobierno. Los aspectos de la deuda y del financiamiento externo mencionados al concluir el informe son sin duda importantes, porla trascendencia de la materia en todos los planos de la vida de los pa\u00edses Creemos que siempre ser\u00e1 posible la acci\u00f3n nacional al respecto y mi delegaci\u00f3n desea hacer notar que es posible disminuir la deuda principalmente como resultado de las operaciones de compra de pagar\u00e9s de la deuda externa en el mercado secundario, materia en la cual mi pa\u00eds ha obtenido ya algunos resultados. Concluyo estas palabras renovando la satisfacci\u00f3n de mi delegaci\u00f3n por la preocupaci\u00f3n de la FAO por la situaci\u00f3n general de la agricultura y de la alimentaci\u00f3n en el mundo, y en especial en el Africa subsahariana en la lucha contra los saltamontes en ese mismo continente, igual que respecto a la contaminaci\u00f3n originada por Chernobyl. Asimismo, confiamos en que llegue a ser una realidad el estudio sobre Am\u00e9rica Latina que se recomend\u00f3 en Barbados y que el se\u00f1or Director General alent\u00f3 en su declaraci\u00f3n en el d\u00eda de ayer en este Consejo. -95- Lino VISANI (Observateur le march\u00e9 agricole, mais aussi les rapports du rappeler, pour information, que le Social Policy Department): Mr Chairman, distinguished delegates, I thank the for thei r valuable comments and sugge stions which will help us improve and expand the final version of the State of Food and Agriculture. In my remarks I shall only cover a few of the queries made by distinguished delegates. First, a request is made that the indepth study of the financing of agricultural development should be presented at the next Conference. I must point out for the distinguished delegate that in fact this section in the present document is a preview (as I mentioned in my introduction) of the special chapter in the full SOFA (State of Food and Agriculture). This section therefore will be expanded in coverage and in and analytically for this purpose. The comments and suggestions made by the delegates will certainly help us in improving this section. A point was made that the document does not refer to the net outflow of capital from developing countries and its adverse impact on agricultural development. It is true that this issue, even though referred to in passing on page 6, paragraph 22, has not been dealt with in depth. The emphasis in this particular section was on the flow of external resources to agriculture, (gross flow rather than net flow) to the entire economy. The chapter refer to two issues equally great importance, such as the fall in terms of trade, to two issues of equally great importance, such as the fall in terms of trade and debt service payments, which in constituted export earnings -96- It was pointed out by some delegates that the document seems to emphasise the importance of domestic market resources to the neglect of external market resources. This was certainly not the intention of the document. The choice is not between one or the other but one of optimum combination depending on the particular circumstances in emphasises in various places the role of liberalization of trade as a factor in the growth of the developing countries. It was stated that not enough attention has been given to fisheries as a the particular section on fisheries does concentrate on production and trade aspects, but in a separate section where we discussed dietary and energy supplies, fisheries do come in as an importance source of and dietary supplies. Some distinguished delegates, the delegate from the UK, mentioned that the documentdoes not refer to the International Timber Organization recently established. It is a unique organization. This was covered in the State of Food and Agriculture 1985 and the details are given in the Commodity Review and Outlook of 1984/85 . Similarly with the Forestry Plan of Action to which reference was made, to those who mentioned the earlier State of Food and Agriculture we do not necessarily cover all these issues in every State of Food and Agriculture . In fact, one must recall that the International Timber Organization is not the only organization of the type which concentrates on research and development, diversification processes, etc. The International Jute Organization had exactly the same purpose, and it has also been covered earlier. Delegates from the EEC, Australia and a few others referred to paragraph 40 of the main document and considered that this was out of date. Indeed, it was, but the supplement does bring it up to date in paragraph 16 of document 90/2 Sup. l. Of course, the updating is also very brief n ecessarily in view of the size of the document itself. We also agree that in the future we should provide greater space for treatment of EEC policy, because of its internal importance but also because of its importance for the rest of the world; but we hope in this context that we would be able to get access to various EEC publications to which at the present moment we do not have access. Reference was made to the need for preparing and implementing and long term in African This has already been initiated. An informal consultation held concerned and the the the medium and long will be to technical and donor meetings that will be held between 15 and 18 D ecember this year at FAO Hea dquarters. The delegate of Mexico and a few others asked a question about the state of progress of the study on the role of transnational corporations in the agricultural sector which has been undertaken by the secretariat at the request of a few delegations. The study, based on a survey of existing literature and studies undertaken by various international institutions, is at an advanced stage. We have sent it to the UN Center for Transnational Corporations for review and comments on it. As delegates are aware, this centre is the unit responsible in the UN system for the study of transnational corporations in all its various aspects and in all sectors. In the meantime, the study can be made available to delegations informally at the time of the next meeting of the.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: On the Secretariat side we had not understood that what the distinguished representative of Mexico was asking for was the inclusion of an item on trans-national corporations in the agenda of the next session of the Committee on Food Security. There is no difficulty at all about doing so. For the record, the rule is that any Member Nation may request the inclusion of an agenda item on the agenda of the Committee at least thirty days before the Committee meets. The Committee will be meeting next spring so we shall be happy to include the agenda Item requested by the Government of Mexico. As for striking the reply from the record, I think the reply of yesterday was on the record. If there was any misunderstanding we apologise for it. However, I think the matter is entirely clear now and we shall go ahead as I have indicated. IV. PROGRAMME, MATTERS IV. LE PROGRAMME, LE BUDGET, LES FINANCES ET L'ADMINISTRATION IV.

BUKHARI (Chairman, Finance Committee) (Original language Arabic): We have two reports from the Finance Committee. We have the report of the 57th Session which was held in Rome from 12th to 20th May 1986, and the report of the 58th Session of the finance Committee which took place from 22nd September to 2nd October 1986. As per the agenda for today you are referred to certain paragraphs in these documents for discussion this morning, and the rest of the report will be reviewed later if you agree and if the Members of -104- the Council think that that is the best way of proceeding with our business, namely that we should most usefully follow the Order of the Day as given to us. As for the report of the 57th Session of the Finance Committee, the matters for discussion refer to paragraphs 10 to 32. Paragraph 10 refers to the financial position of the Organization. This paragraph gives the results of 1984/85. Before I go over the content of those paragraphs, I should like to thank the FAO Secretariat for the information which has been supplied to the Finance Committee. We have never had any difficulties whatsoever in carrying out our dialogue with those representatives in the department of the FAO concerned with these matters. Paragraph 10 deals with the financial of the Organi zation: the out-turn , 1984/85 gives us figures which to be understood as provisional because they were given to us in May at the time of the discussion which is herein reported upon. Therefore, please understand that these figures are not definite. As you can see, the cash surplus is $34 758 000. Paragraph 11 refers to the factors which have led to the generation of that cash surplus. Paragraph 15 shows that at 31 December 1985 the cash balance of the Working Capital Fund amounted to $13 253 975. Paragraph 16 first of all shows the status of contributions to the FAO budget. There is a comparative table, that is a comparison of the years 1985-1986. That is on page 4. The amounts outstanding at 12 May 1985 were also given to us. Consequently, amendments must be made to them because those figures are certainly not up to date. If you turn to paragraph 17, current receipts, and the amounts outstanding in 1986, you will see a co mparison for the four previous years, at the same date of course. In paragraph 18 you will see a table which indicates the percentages of current assessments r eceived. This is the usual presentation of these figures. Paragraph 19 gives receipts to date of 1986 which were only $63 461 670, that is, almost 32 percent of the assessed contributions for 1986. Still on paragraph 19, you will obser ve that 105 me mber nations had made no payments for their 1986 assessment. S till on paragraph 19, there is a diagram of the percentages of current assessments r eceived. Paragraph refers situation is described in paragraphs 20-22 which refer to the position of the Organization in the future. Moving to paragraph 25, the FAO indicated that the contributor would be known only towards the end of 1986, which is why the members of the Committee felt at the time that it would be premature to make proposals to Council. In paragraph the to examined a series of measures which could be implemented to try and settle this matter of delayed r eceipt of assessments. The question was again discussed the 58th Meeting of the Finance Committee, in fact in this document we have indicated that the matter was going to be dealt with during the 58th Meeting. Paragraphs 29 and further on the financial situation, and for the Technical Cooperation Programme. Paragraph 31 deals with the cash flow of the General Fund. At 31 March 1986 the balance for the 1986/87 biennium was $21. 5 million. In paragraph 32 we refer to the status of the Special Reserve Account, which is there for information. When it reviewed these matters, the Committee t ook note that the dollar ex change rate was 1 613 lira, whereas the exchange rate for the budget calculation was 1 760 lira to the dollar. These are the paragraphs which require particular attention from Council this morning, and having introduced them I am here to answer any further points of information which you may care to raise. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie que nous pourrions l'examiner point par point -105- et, le Conseil nous Je si le Conseil en convient, que D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom's statement will be in two parts. First, I should like to address the issues arising from the reports of the Finance Committee which have relevance to the Organization's financial position, and with your permission, Mr Chairman, this will be slightly broader than the paragraphs we have referred to earlier since we think these are relevant to the very important problems before us. Secondly, I should like to set out the position of my government on the proposals contained in document CL 90/23. We have read the reports of the Finance Committee. with considerable interest. Once more we have to be grateful to the Committee for its guiding wisdom and the manner in which its work stimulates our desire to learn more about the issues which its reports bring before this Council meeting. The report gives us a rich menu. Time permits us the choice of only a few items at this meeting. In any comment on the financial position of the Organization we must begin by endorsing the comments of the Committee in paragraph 24 of document CL 90/4 \"that other Member Nations should not be called upon to compensate for the deficit caused by reduced payments by any contributor\". At this point we should like to make our position on this very clear. In common with other members of the European Community my government takes the view that all member states should meet their financial obligations in full and promptly in accordance with the constitution. Turning again to the report of the Finance Committee, we were, however, slightly surprised that in its consideration of the financial situation no mention was made by the Committee of what we take to be the very high level of liquidity in FAO which, according to the figures in the financial statement, stand at nearly $300 000 000. This is the amount of money that FAO has in liquid assets in the bank on short deposit or in cash. Of course, this amount is in addition to the working capital and other funds held by FAO, so there is a lot of money already in the Organization. We consider this high level of liquidity poses serious questions about the style of financial management within the Organization. These are questions which call for examination by the Committee, by Council and by Conference. We were also surprised to see no mention of the very slow rate of disbursement on the Technical Cooperation Programme where again, according to the financial st atement, only $26. 8 million was spent out of a budget appropriation biennium-leaving $45 to into 1986/87 biennium. We would submit that these are significant items in any consideration of both the financial health and the financial management systems of the Organization, and they are factors which have to be taken into account when examining spending and income. At the beginning of this session the Director-General referred to the fall in administrative costs and establishment costs. These falls are very commendable,-but when we look at the overall programme delivery costs, that is all the costs FAO incurs to deliver the programmes, including statistical programmes, the global information and early warning system as well as the Technical Cooperation Programme, we believe there that these further savings could, in fact, enable the Organization to live within the current financial provisions without the need to reduce any programmes. I think this is a very salient point. Normally, in these circumstances we would expect an agency to reduce its programmes when faced with a shortfall, but we believe in the case of FAO that the delivery costs and the liquidity of the Organization put it in a very fortunate position it can afford to live within its means and not reduce its programmes, and do so by saving on overheads. We were very interested to read the information about the level of project support costs on page 13 of the Finance Committee's report. Since the exchange in Conference on administrative costs we have been examining the information contained in the Programme and Budget document. This is an FAO document C 85/3 which we all received at the last Conference and we find this document per mits us to undertake a calculation of FAO's programme delivery costs. We have written to the Secretariat about this and, in the interests of transparency and to help with this discussion, we have given details to Council Members of our analysis of the real level of the FAO programme delivery costs. I should emphasise that these are calculations which have not been agreed with the Secretariat, but they are entirely based on FAO's own figures, and figures published in the Budget -106- Our analysis leads us to believe that the figures given in the Finance Committee Reports are a considerable underestimate of th e true programme delivery costs i. e. the cost of FAO's whether are in project Our analysis based on FAO figures puts the overall cost of delivery for all programmes (that is the Regular Programme, UNDP and the Trust Fund) at over 36 percent of the delivered programme. The figures for the actual budgetary fund from the information contained in the Budget is approximately 14 percent, that is close to the maximum that the FAO can charge the UNDP and Trust Fund donors, but the figures for the Regular Programme appear to be 97 percent, in other words, if we are to believe the Budget on the Regular Programme it costs FAO 97 cents to spend a dollar! This cannot be correct and it does suggest to us that there i s a greater element of cross-subsidy between the programmes than revealed in the figures put to the Finance Committee. The cost of delivering the Trust Fund Programme and the UNDP Programme has, in fact, been put to the Regular Programme. Even then, at over 36 percent of the overall level of programme delivery costs, we think the overhead costs in the FAO are far too high. We would expect that a reasonable level of costs would be in the region of 15 to 20 percent. In the face of the financial crisis w e believe that it is of crucial importance that the Organization reduces its overheads and we believe that the time has now come for the question of programme delivery costs to be considered in depth by the Finance Committee and subsequently by the Council and Conference. The question of transparency discussed by the Finance Committee is also to discussion. We are sure that the Committee is correct when it says that it is satisfied that such information, as it needed to fill its mandates, had been, and would continue to be, made available to it. In our dealings with the Secretariat we have found them extremely ready to supply us with information and at this point it would be appropriate particularly to thank Mr. Shah for the information that he has provided u s with in terms of the documentation which is always made available to this Council. The problems in our experience stem from the nature of the information available in FAO itself. In our view there is a clear distinction between the nature of the informati on which is necessary for accounting purposes and the nature of financ ial information which is necessary if senior management is t o manage the programme effectively. Unfortunaltely, our experience has been that such information is often unavailable within the FAO. It is not simply a question of transparency, it is a question of the absence of basic information necessary for senior management to manage programmes effectively. For almost a year now we have not been able to obtain information regarding spending under the Technical Cooperation Programme. We have obtained information of commitments, and this has its uses, but we have not been able to obtain information about hard cash transactions. Effective programme management requires information of hard cash transactions. Every day I know how much money I spend. I also know how much money I am obligated to spend. It seems sensible that FAO should have the same information. This does not appear to be available in FAO. Coupled with such the auditors' criticism regarding the purchase of word-processing equipment, and our own examination of delivery cost s, its absence must raise grave reservations about the effectiveness of the financial and management information systems within th e Agency. In view of the considerable financial crisis faced by the Agency, we consider as a matter of urgency, the financial and management systems of the Organization should be subject to full scrutiny and consideration by Council in Conference. Turning now to document CL 90/23 I would like to make the following observations on behalf of the United Kingdom. of budgetary contribution which is largely brought about by the present financial crisis is as a result of a default by a Member Nation. It must therefore be treated differently from the normal delayed payments which occur in every biennium. We believe that Director-General must further expenditure postponements The shortfall be bridged the Working Capital Fund or by mortgaging the financial future of the Organization beyond the current biennium. We do not agree with any proposal that involves borrowing by the Agency. First and foremost, as the Director-General has already recognized, the Organization significant other strategies to face similar difficulties, for example, in the United Nations, in UNIDO and in Unesco. To be more specific we invite attention to the potential for achieving further savings in the following areas of financial management and budget. There should be a once and for all tightening up of financial management systems to ensure that the Agency makes optimum use of the money it has. For example, more effective financial management would enable use to be made of the 300 m illion dollars shown as liquid assets on page 27 of document C 87/5. It must be noted that this amount is in addition to the special funds and as such there is no reason why it cannot be managed more effectively to reduce it to a more realistic lev el. Closer scrutiny is obviously costs. in the Regular Programme in the 1986/87 biennium is for 209 m illion dollars, yet the proposed savings on page A. 9 CL 90/23 is only 59 000. This is relatively insignificant and there must be scope for a greater reduction. Similarly, savings of only 1.8 m illion dollars have been found from appropriation of 45 m illion dollars for FAO Representatives. Given the magnitude of this provision it does seem to my delegation that in the face of the financial pressures of the Organization it is necessary to seek greater economies here. -107- Document CL 90/23 is vague on the savings made in spending by Regional Offices yet the appropriation in the Budget for Regional Offices is nearly 38 million dollars. We would have expected far more specific treatment of item. but the importance this Programme and we believe that with improved financial management it should be possible to maintain the Programme and, at the same time, make a substantial contribution to the further economies which the present situation demands. We believe that this can be achieved by a more realistic approach to financial forecasting and better cash-flow management. It is clear from the financial statement that this Prog ramme is slow spending. In 1983/84 on a 72 million dollar programme, 45 million dollars remained unspent at the end of the biennium. We have no reason to believe that this slow rate of spending will-not be repeated and compounded in of Programme would clearly voluntary funding to fund TCP projects in the future so the momentum of the Programme can be maintained. We have already referred to the very high programme delivery costs associated with all FAO programmes. We remain that there is further scope in such items as field programme support, administration and common services. To conclude, we believe that the economies proposed in CL 90/23 are a beginning, but they are not more than that. 16 million dollars is not a significant saving when we see that programme delivery cost s amount to more than 200 million dollars on the Regular Programme alone. We think it is essential for the Director-General to come forward with additional savings. The Organization like all other parts of the UN system must adapt to the new financial realities. None of us can live beyond our resources and it would be irresponsible of this Council not to acknowledge points tel que l'a annonc\u00e9 le calendrier: le point 12. 1 qui est la photographie de la situation actuelle et du document CL 90/23, ainsi que ses suppl\u00e9ments I do not want to infringe in any way on your ruling which will, I believe, permit the Council to have an orderly debate on a very complicated subject. Before hearing I would, nevertheless, like at this stage, if I may, to make one or two general comments on the statement by the United Kingdom, not dealing, however, specifically with the measures dealt with in document CL 90/23. He questioned, in the first place, the whole concept in the way of transparency. What he appeared to be saying was that the concept of transparency so far applied is not enough. If it is not enough, we would like to know how and in what way it is inadequate. This was discussed, as he pointed out, in the Finance Committee. The Director-General has made every effort to provide the information requested by Member Governments and he is to provide systematically and on an across-the-board basis such information as may be required collectively by the organs of the Organization. In more also FAO has applied extremely prudent and careful managerial standards in the handling of its resources. Indeed, it is thanks to a very prudent approach in the management of resources that the management is not in a very much worse financial state now than it might have been. There are one or two additional points of a somewhat more technical nature which may help the Council to appreciate the general background to the Finance Committee Report and the other related matters which will be coming up in the course of today and if you agree, Mr Chairman, perhaps Mr Shah could give one or two additional explanations without at this stage broaching the actual measures proposed under document CL 90/23. PRESIDENT: Nous nous en par souci d'une analyse plus approfondie du document, au point 12. 1 et dans ce contexte je demande \u00e0 M. Shah de bien of Programme, Budget and Evaluation): As desired by you and by the Deputy Director General may I at this stage respond only to two matters among those raised by the delegate of the United Kingdom. Firstly, I would like to deal with comments he offered on programme delivery costs in FAO. We have listened with attention to the points made by the delegate regarding his administration's assessment of programme delivery costs in FAO. It had been my personal pleasure to see the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom and his advisor a few months ago when they came to discuss the subject with me. They requested clarifications on our Programme of Work and Budget document which my colleagues and I gave, and I appreciate his kind remarks on the matter. We never heard a word more until the day before yesterday. Because it was then somewhat of a surprise to r eceive Mr Deare's letter to me of the 17th of November forwarding ODAs assessment and conclusions which I never had the opportunity to comment on. If I had had a chance to discuss the paper and the conclusions with its author, I would have been able to say in private rather than in public that it is based on faulty and therefore arrives at paper the bulk of our expenditure under the Regular Programme into two categories, the delivery programme and the programme costs. Putting of our substantive output and our overhead. Now it is pretty clear that in the case of projects executed in the field what is a substantive output and what is the overhead. The delivery'programme and the programme delivery costs can be identified and measured without much controversy and in fact this is the information we regularly supply to the Finance Committee and which appears in its report. The output under a field project may be a laboratory, an irrigation scheme or a training institute. The overhead consists of the costs in Rome for technical and administrative services provided to the project. However it is much more difficult in the case of the Regular Programme to distinguish between the substantive output and the overhead. For instance, a large part of the delivery programme under the Regular Programme consists of publications drafted and produced in Rome. The dividing line between the programme cost of a publication and its overhead costs is much less obvious and consequently more difficult to define. Again, individual staff members may be devoting part of their time to substantive activities and part of it to activities that could be considered as overhead. It is perhape surprising that the British analysis has fallen into a number of basic errors in attempting to separate programme costs from delivery costs. The first series of mistakes is in counting as delivery costs our expenditure on activities which are actually substantive in output and let me give one or two examples. Programme 1. 3 Legal is counted entirely as a programme delivery cost. This includes the offices of the Legal Counsel and the legislation branch. Seventy percent of of legislation branch which Member Nations on its formulation, on its application. I am sure members of the Council will be personally acquainted with the substantive work done particularly in the field of water and fisheries legislation. Now, how can this be categorized as a programme delivery cost. The same can be said about our documentation systems like AGRIS which are counted as a programme delivery cost, and yet this is a technical programme with an output in publications, magnetic tapes, services provided to the member countries. They are certainly not overhead, or in the United Kingdom phraseology, programme delivery costs. I could go right on through the United Kingdom analysis picking out parts of the Programme of Work and Budget which are actually substantive and which have been put down as overhead. There is another series of fundamental errors in this analysis. Certain expenditures are common to both the Regular Programme and the Field Programme. The analysis has treated them entirely as a cost of delivering the Regular Programme. For instance, the full cost of our Assistant Directors-General, our Division Directors, our Regional Representatives is counted as a Regular Programme cost. Now as we all know they and their senior staff spend at least as much time on field activities as they do on Regular Programme activities. Even more striking is the fact that the full cost of the \\FAO country offices is counted as if it were an overhead of the Regular Programme. Yet the functions and activities of these offices relate almost entir ely to the support of projects in the field in our field activities. Another major error is to put down the regional offices in their entirety as a programme delivery cost, in other words, as an overhead. However, as you well know, most of the activities of the regional offices are substantive in nature. There are technical officers working in the regional offices, visiting countries and working with them. These are programme activities and not an overhead\u00b7 I could continue but I fear that I might confuse the Council even more than it might have been confused already. I would merely like to add that I must emphatically reject the conclusion of the analysis that 49. 4 percent of the Regular Programme budget is the Regular Programme delivery cost. The true figure might be a fraction, maybe about one-third of what is alleged. -109- I would like to invite the authors of this paper, this analysis to come to Rome for a few days to sit down with me and my colleagues. In this way we could agree to methodologies and and arrive objective is to compare FAO with other organizations and the United Kingdom's own bilateral programme we would be able to see the comparative figures for the United Kingdom bilateral aid programmes and for the other organizations with which a comparison was attempted to be made. As far as we know FAO compares very favourably with other institutions, both multilateral and bilateral. In a broader context the United Kingdom analysis-calls for two things. The first is \"for more detailed information\", and I am quoting from this analysis, \"for more detailed information to be given to member states the calculation and allocation of echoed his words and sentiments a few the Director-General said also in his closing statement to the last session of the FAO Conference that he is willing to give any explanation that Member Nations want. All that is necessary for the members to agree on what is required; for instance, in the format of the Programme of Work and Budget document. Member Natio ns should also be aware of any extra cost involved in providing any additional information. This is surely a matter that needs to be discussed freely in a technical body such as the Programme Committee, the Finance Committee, before it comes to the Council. Some relevant issues were, in fact, discussed by the Finance Committee at its 57th Session in May under the heading \"Transparency of FAO Activities\" and attention has already been drawn to paragraphs 74 to 77 of the Finance Committee report which is before you. In the second place the United Kingdom analysis calls for \"A continued attempt by the secretariat to reduce delivery overheads\". It is not necessary for me to summarize now all that we have done in the last ten years or all that we are doing now to achieve this objective. On this issue the paper, the analysis can only be described as preaching to the converted, or what is sometimes referred to in the United Kingdom as carrying coals to Newcastle. I would now like to deal with the second subject of the Technical Cooperation Programme. Some fairly strong made amount of the TCP appropriation which is alleged to be unutilized and for which the funds from 1984/85 have been carried over into the present biennium. To some it may be a little surprising but this subject is raised with such regularity because it was something which was considered not only by the Council but by the Finance Committee and by the Conference itself when the Technical Cooperation Programme was established in 1976. In fact, the amended the financial regulations of the Organizations to provide for the TCP funds to be available over two biennia. Why was this? It was quite simply because the TCP is a are approved during the entire course of a biennium right up to the last day of 1985 in the case of the 1984-85 biennium, and these projects then had to be executed, implemented, and the related expenditures effected during 1986 and to some extent even in 1987. There has been complete transparency on this principle and on all the financial and accounting information related to it. What are the funds carried out from the TCP appropriation from one biennium to another? In 1976/77 they were 63 percent. There was a reason for it. The TCP was just starting. In fact the first projects were not approved until the end of 1976, so percent, around the same order, in the case of 1984/85 the $15 million for the African Rehabilitation Programme for Africa in addition to the normal TCP provision, which was only approved in the spring of 1985. If we are going to consider what is used and what is not used of the TCP appropriation let me share with the Council figures which were shared with the Finance Committee. If we take the 1984/85 appropri ation of $56. 5 million, to which was added the $15 million, which raised it to $72. 5 millio n, those were the total funds available for the TCP in 1984/85. How much of that amount was approved for projects? It is the amount signed by member governments constitute our commitments. The amount approved for projects at the end of 1985 was $72 290 000 out of $72 470 000. This does not strike me as an underutilisation of the TCP. Take the appropriation for the TCP for this biennium, $61. 4 million, how much has been approved so far from that appropriation for projects on the approved projects which have been signed and to which we are committed? As at the end of October, $30. 7 million, almost a good half by the end of October. How many requests are pending? There are 247 valid requests, not counting requests which are discarded because they do not meet the criteria of the TCP, and our resources permit us to approve only about 30 a month, whereas new requests come in at the rate of at least 45 a month. I will with your permission stop there. I felt that the point raised was substantial enough that if it also raised questions in the minds of other Council members assist in providing this explanation at the outset. -110- James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): Normally it has been my experience in FAO meetings that. interventions have been dealt with at the end of the debate. I am very grateful for the explanatory introduction by the Deputy Director-General and by Mr Shah and I hope that in this spirit you will permit me to reply immediately to their comments. In connection Mr. Shah's comments about delivery costs, I would emphasise that all our figures have been taken from FAO's own published documents and that they have been distributed between the Regular Programme and the Extra-Budgetary Fund exactly in the way they are distributed in the budget document, so if there is any confusion, it is a confusion which must come from the presentation of that document. To turn to specific items, Mr Shah said that we included legal costs and the costs of documentation as project delivery, when, in fact, these were substantive programmes. I am glad to hear this. This information is not in the budget document. Treating them all as substantive programmes still means' that the delivery costs amount to over $270 million as these are relatively minor programmes. We appreciate the point about publications. This is why we did not include them at all as programme delivery costs. Turning now to the question of the resident FAO representatives, we are very grateful to Mr Shah for his statement that resident representatives are deployed funds because, quoting from the budget, we see cost for resident representatives under extra budgetary funds is only $2. 6 million, while under the Regular Programme the cost for resident representatives is listed as $45 million. I understood from Mr Shah that within this $45 million the resident representatives are undertaking work in the Field Programmes. It would have been better if this had been made clear from the budget. This comes back to our original point that there is cross subsidy between the Regular Programme and the Field Programme and the extra budgetary funds. Mr Shah has confirmed this himself by his statement. My first comment on this would be that we hope that the budget document would correctly reflect this cross subsidy. Turning to the TCP, I would simply say that we are very impressed by Mr Shah's presentation and his knowledge of the cash flow payment in the Programmes. Given this knowledge of the spending in the Programme that he displayed, we continue to be surprised that in the circumstances there is such a large roll-over. Our experience has been that normally financial managers are expected to keep the roll-over to a minumum. We are therefore very surprised, given clear knowledge of the spending profile of the Programme, that so much money goes to another biennium. We are questioning not the level of the programme but the way it is managed. John GLISTRUP (Denmark): I am getting slightly confused. I came here prepared to discuss Agenda Item 12.1 Financial Position of the Organization including Measures to Deal with Problems of Delayed Payment of Contributions, have listened very carefully to the intervention by the Chairman of the Finance Committee. I have listened to an interesting intervention by the United Kingdom. I have listened to a statement by the Deputy Director-General and Mr Shah commenting upon a document which is unknown to me. Mr Chairman, may I request you to help us direct our debates in such a way that we can deal with this important issue in front of us. I was waiting to hear from the Secretariat on the measures to be taken in the difficult financial position that we have and I was prepared to comment on that. LE PRESIDENT: En fait, un annonc\u00e9 point, 12. 1a), \u00e0 savoir les mesures (Brazil): I cannot say as well that I enjoyed the private and bilateral exchange of views between Mr Shah and the United Kingdom representative on this question of programme delivery costs. I must recognise on the other hand that I enjoyed the quite excellent introduction that Mr Shah made of the TCP. But I agree with your views, Mr Chairman, that the -111- discussion was clearly out of order and that we should try to concentrate on the Agenda as it has been put to us. On the other hand, it is not exactly too easy to try to deal with the performance of the Agenda as it is. It is difficult to deal with the Report of Finance Committee without dealing to some extent, or to a large extent, it depends on the speaker, with the point raised in 12. 1(a), Budgetary and Cash Flow Forecast relating to the Programme of Work and Budget. I should like to go along with your ruling and to deal with the report of the Finance Committee in a broad context, and to deal later on with point (a) concerning the approach necessary to with the regrets that contributor against its assessed contribution has brought insecurity to FAO and is leading the Organization towards a financial interbudgetary crisis. As has been said already, the worst features of the present situation are (a) the uncertainty that such a Member is not going to pay its full contribution due to FAO; and (b) the uncertainty regarding the timing and amounts of present and future payments by that Member. In spite of severe economic and financial problems, a year ago developing countries gave their full support to the modest increase proposed by the Director-General in the Programme of Work and Budget for 1986-87 biennium and this was approved by the Conference. Therefore, it is with great concern that we envisage embarking now on a revision of Programme of whose approval resulted from a commitment Member Nations. Returning to the main question envisaged in the report of the Finance Committe, I should like to say that shortfalls in the payments of contributions have occurred previously but where as a whole confined to the rules of international organizations and justified problem FAO activities as they have represented around 5 of estimated not to depart in any significant way from the average of recent years, namely around US $20 million. This in itself is an extraordinary performance, given the financial uncertainties faced by developing countries and I should like to this point which we consider to be quite important. Special cases of previously authorised the However, our view the present situation is completely different because it relates to almost 72 percent in 1986. percent results also from a unilateral and arbitrary decision of a Member State and is the reflection of a political decision. Actually; if the debt contribution of that Member State is paid, the financial situation of the Organization will improve in relation to the situation over the five preceding years. The percentage of current assessments received in 1986 would then rise to 89. 84 percent, about 90 percent of the current contributions r eceived, (the highest in many years) and, not about 65 percent as mentioned at page 3 of the document CL 90/LIM/1. I should like to stress a point concerning the report of the Finance Committee, and this point in broad terms is that the liquidity crisis is not in itself or members. The crisis revolves around the financial decision by the main contributor regarding its contribution. Let us not disguise the issue. Taking into account your ruling I will refrain now from commenting upon the proposals made to deal with the situation, and I shall ask your indulgence to speak concerning the specific proposals made by the Director- General as to the ways and means of eventually the Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 financier, dans le cadre du point 12. 1, afin qu'il nous pr\u00e9sente le document CL 90/17. Atif Y. BUKHARI (Chairman, Finance Committee) (Original language Arabic): This document which we have-CL 90/17, is the latest report of the Finance highlights the 90/17) contains a certain number of points which were discussed and which are up before this Council for review. What we have to do is to look particularly at paragraphs 13 to 45, which are the paragraphs for particular attention this morning by Members of the Council. Other items will be contained in other points which we are called upon to examine. -112- Paragraph 13 refers to the financial position of the Organization and the status of contributions as it stood at the meeting. Some of the sums still outstanding on 25th September, which is the reference date, are large sums. For the period 1986 these are, I repeat, amounts which are quite considerable. If you refer to paragraph 14 you will observe a table which gives the current status of contributions and in following tables. These sort of percentages are presented on a basis to highlight what was paid in January, February, March, April and so on up to the end of the year. In September (paragraph 15) we have in 1986-63. 35 percent; 1984-60. percent; 1983-55 33 percent; and so on. In paragraphs 18, 19 and 20 we have the statement of arrears which are in arrears status. In paragraph 18 you will note that there is reference to receipts of the Organization-US$9 841 273, a sum which is reasonably satisfactory as compared to what was paid in 1985 or in previous years. In paragraph 20, once again the Committee as usual, appeals strongly to all Member Nations to match up to their financial responsibilities namely to pay in what is currently due and their arrears. The Member States must be fully aware of the difficult situation of the Organization in order to understand the strength of that appeal which is made to them. I will stop at that paragraph and be ready to answer any questions which Members of Council may raise, if that would be satisfactory to you, or perhaps you would like me to continue with the presentation of the rest of the paragraphs in this document. LE PRESIDENT: Si vous t gagner du temps, terminer l'expos\u00e9 aux orateurs? Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal. Republic of): On this point, you ask whether or not we are content that the Chairman of the Finance Committee should continue. I think that now there is confusion in the room. Do you consider your proposal to change the agenda as taken by the majority of the Council, and that we can follow this rule because with regard to our agenda I should like to draw your attention to the fact that we have already separated agenda item 12. 1. In our view we should not continue to separate the agenda items. We are prepared to bring everything together in our statement. The Danish and Brazilian delegates are of the LE Ma proposition \u00e9tait que le pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 financier termine la lecture du document CL 90/17. Sans plus. Terminons le CL 90/17 qui se trouve dans le point 12. 1. Apr\u00e8s quoi, nous passerions la parole \u00e0 M. Crowther le document qui reste toujours dans le calendrier du point 12. 1, \u00e0 CL 90/LIM/1. passerions la parole aux orateurs sur le point 12. 1. Si le Conseil pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que l'on fasse les deux en m\u00eame temps, pouvons le faire. Si le Conseil d\u00e9cide que l'on lise le document CL 90/23 en temps que le CL 90/17, COUTTS (Australia): I should to say that the Australian delegation is also getting a little confused. We would certainly prefer to hear the introductions to the document now from the Secretariat and then to have the opportunity to make a statement in a general way covering agenda items 12.1 and 12.1 (a). This would be much easier for us and, I suspect, for other delegations. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Deseo opinar, se\u00f1or Presidente, sobre la consulta que usted hace al Consejo en relaci\u00f3n con -- el modo de proceder. Estoy de acuerdo con el delegado que me ha precedido en el uso de la palabra en que se ha creado una confusi\u00f3n que, obviamente, es evitable. Si bien recuerdo, el haber dividido los temas, el 12, digamos, como el documento que nos ha presentado el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, habla sido solicitado por la delegaci\u00f3n del Reino Unido. El y su delegaci\u00f3n han expuesto ya su punto y ha sido incluso aclarado \u00e9ste por la Secretarla. -113- Creo que conviene en este caso, y adem\u00e1s es inevitable, que nos centremos en el problema principal, el tema financiero que es la incertidumbre de la misma, ya que ser\u00eda artificial e innecesario evitar llegar al punto concreto que est\u00e1 contenido en el documento 23. LE PRESIDENT: Si vous le permettez, nous allons aborder point aurons la lecture du point 12 \u00e0 concr\u00e9tiser par le document 90/23 avec ses suppl\u00e9ments le (Original language Arabic): I find it a little difficult to see where the misunderstanding is because the items which we have to deal with this morning particularly are from paragraphs 13 to 45 of this document. I did propose to subdivide these, but as Council seems to wish an overall presentation, I will go on. The question which still requires introduction on these paragraphs is the measures examined by the Finance Committee to deal with delays in payment of contributions. We have dealt with these matters in previous sessions, and in the latest session of the Finance Committee, that is in September, we came back over this ground again and looked particularly at seven possible solutions-six alternatives if you like-which could help to see a way out of this impasse of assessments in arrears. These options were all put to Council, and three were particularly highlighted which we thought would be the best offered way to try and get out of the present situation. I refer you particularly to paragraph 31 : \"Notwithstanding the difficulties and complexities felt that it should continue to pursue this matter a subsequent Session, particularly, on solutions which respond to the following criteria. \" Three alternatives are listed. Council, therefore, will take decisions on the most judicious measures and refer them back to the Finance Committee, and if n ecessary to the General Conference. These solutions will serve to encourage member states to pay up their contributions. At least, that is what the Finance Committee thought. Of course, there is no punitive incentives, to to pay their contributions. The Committee also wish that these three alternatives should in no way harm the contributions of the Member Nations concerned. I move on to paragraph 32 which introduces a section on Other Information on the Financial Position. It refers to the expenditure and obligations up to the time of that meeting-i. e. the September session of the Finance Committee. In paragraph 34 we have a statement on the Cash Flow of the General Fund. You will see that we had $31. 5 million up to 31 August 1986-for the biennium 1986-87. In paragraph 35 we make a statement on the status of the special reserve account. Again, up to 31 August the sum was $16. 8 million. In paragraphs 36 and 37 we have a forecast on budgetary and cash flow status during the biennium. These paragraphs are very important as they do refer to the budgetary situation in the future and we draw your attention particularly to them. In paragraph 44 , we should like to invite you to bring your attention to bear on all of this section. It states that the Director-General in the meeting of the Finance Committee announced what savings he proposed to make in programme delivery. The measures which he proposed are quoted here. Staff costs are involved. This is based upon a meeting which was held before we were fully aware of the situation involving the non-payment of a large assessment to the Organization. Paragraph 45 also states that the Committee welcomed what the Director-General had proposed, and the proposal is quoted in the preceding paragraph 44. In fact, the Director-General has asked for a special session of the Finance Committee to be held next month on 15 to 16 December so that a final review of the financial situation of the Organization may be made. Mr Chairman, members of the Council, that concludes my introduction. I stand ready to answer any questions which may be raised by Council members. I thank you for your attention. Dean K. CROWTHER (Assistant Director-General, Administration and Finance Department): I will refer to document CL 90/LIM/1, and at the same time in comparison with the information which was just reported by the Finance Committee Chairman, would you have available document CL 90/17 page 3 , because document LIM /1 updates page 3 from the period of 25 September up to. -114- last Saturday and gives you the status of contributions up to last Saturday. It is important to note the changes which have occurred since the reporting to the Finance Committee to give Council the latest information. Would you look first at page 3 of document CL 90/17 on which the Chairman of the Finance Committee was reporting and note the third underlined heading \"Amounts outstanding at 25 September\". You will assessments together with contributions in arrears totalled $87, 138, 947 at that date. That represents the amount owed to the Organization by the Member Nations in current assessments and contributions. Since that time, as shown on the face of document CL 90/LIM/1, you will see that we r eceived a sum of $3, 480, 000 since 25 September and as of 15 November, last Saturday. If you will turn over the page of CL 90/LIM/1 you will see the 1986 colu mn again which compares with the same information reported to the Finance Committee on 25 September, and you will see that the amount owed as of 15 November has been reduced now to $83, 730, 609. That compares with the opposite for 1985 of only $62 substantial difference. There are two reasons for the difference. One was that there was a distribution of surplus in 1985 that applied heavily against the paying faster in 1985 than they are in 1986. If I can call your attention to the following page, and particularly paragraph 5, you will note there is a comparative schedule for 1986 and the previous four years as to the r eceipt of current assessments. This does not include arrears. This is current assessments only. I should particularly like to call your attention to the September/October figures, and note a particular pattern, because it is an important point. to show that there are many Member Nations who are not paying this year at the same rate as they have been paying in prior years. The largest contributor has normally paid in November, the percentages and compare October with November for the prior four years you will see a substantial jump in the percentages. For the most part, that represents the payment of the largest contributor. But now look at the October figures. In October the largest contributor had not paid, you see respective paid by the remainder of the members, the amounts which have been received at that point. For 1986 we are comparing in October 64.75 percent with 73 percent in 1985, 86 percent in 1984, 75 percent in 1983, and 56 percent in 1982. It was only the year 1982 in which r eceipts were coming in slower than they are in this year. It is important to note that receipts are not coming in as rapidly from many Member Nations at this point. LE votre permission, vais passer la Shah pour exposer le document CL 90/23 Sup. 1 et 2. V. J. SHAH (Director, Office of Programme, Budget and Evaluation): It is my pleasure to introduce this item on behalf of the Director-General. We face a serious problem of liquidity affecting the implementation of our Programme of Work and Budget for 1986/87. This has led the Director-General to submit a document for the consideration of the Council, document CL 90/23 with its supplements 1 and 2, and to invite the Council to deal with this matter at the earliest time during this Session. In November 1985 our Conference approved the Programme of Work and Budget for 1986/87 on an amount of $437 million, and requested the Director-General to implement it up to that amount. The fact that we currently have to face is that contributions are not paid in on time and up to the amounts due. The assessment of the income shortfall is a difficult and fluid matter when we are not certain what each Member Nation will pay and when it will pay the amounts due. The situation has worsened considerably since the Finance Committee met in September and considered the matter. It has even worsened since the document before you was prepared. We now estimate the income shortfall fo r $92 million. There are three factors responsible. Firstly, we face, as always, the fact that all Member Nations do not find it possible pay Memb er Nations at $26 Secondly, because of the sharp decline in interest and a lower level of our funds, of the lower contributions, our be less was estimated in the Programme of Work and Budget. The third factor is that we face, for the first time, the prospect of a shortfall in the payments by our largest contributor. This shortfall is totally different from the arrears of other Member Nations, because it is based on legislative action not to pay the full contribution due to the United Nations and some specialized. -115- agencies, including FAO. Consequently, it is a real cut in our income and it will represent, and it will be treated as, arrears due to the Organization. We have no way of knowing when these arrears would be settled. In the circumstances a full implementation Work and Budget as authorized would inevitably lead to a cash flow problem before the end of this biennium if no corrective measures were taken. The problem is not a legal one. It is not a question requiring submission to the Conference to amend the Programme of Work and Budget which it has We are not debating whether the question requires submission to the Conference, it is a fact of force majeure of the Director-General not receiving the resources required needed to implement the full Programme of Work and Budget. In the circumstances he does have the option of making use of the authority to borrow which was conferred on him by the Council in 1981 and reconfirmed by the Conference in 1983. However, the Director-General has rejected this option for the time being so as not to create an additional burden on Member Nations. He prefers to take managerial action to contain expenditures where possible in order to avert a cash flow problem for as long as possible. His policy aim in the circumstances is two-fold. Firstly, on the one hand, to implement the approved Programme of Work and Budget to the maximum extent possible and, on the other hand, to avoid problems of cash flow. He has studied the situation in all its aspects and considered all options. The first course of action is to make programme savings from postponements, reductions, of certain activities. We should not close our eyes to the fact that all these measures have programme implications. In the circumstances, these are managerial measures to to the maximum extent possible the programme content, particularly in the In particular, the Technical Cooperation Programme is not proposed to be affected at all. We do have precedents for programme savings. We were obliged to make them in 1972/73 by as much as 7. 6 percent of the then budget. We were also obliged to make them in 1980/81 at a level of 2. 5 percent of the then budget. The proposals now total 3. 7 percent of our current budget. Other organizations in the United Nations system affected by the same problem are also forced to make similar adjustments ranging from 4 percent in the case of the United Nations to around 7 percent in the case of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite the measures which I have just indicated and in addition to them, it will be n ecessary to draw on the Working Capital Fund for the maximum extent of its resources of $13 million. The Working Capital Fund exists precisely to deal with the present situation and its use would be fully in accordance with the financial regulations. With the implementation of the measures proposed we estimate that we would a cash flow problem during this biennium. We would begin 1988 with a cr edit of $98 million, a credit representing outstanding contributions, legally due to the Organization. part of this amount is settled promptly we will not have the resources to meet our financial obligations in the first mo nth of 1988 arising from commitments incu rred in 1987. It is entirely normal that the expenditures relating to the activities of one biennium are not spent entirely within the same biennium. There are expenditures, for instance, for supplies or contractual services, the invoices for which are only received in the year following the biennium. In 1988 we would need to meet financial obligations of some $60 million relating to the present biennium by the contributions actually paid. At the present time we have indicated an estimate of some $30 million. In recent days number of Representatives have raised the the 1984/85 cash surplus amounting to $34. 7 million which will be distributed to Member Nations on 1 January 1987. The witholding of the distribution of this cash surplus, which would indeed require a special session of Conference to be convened at thirty days notice before 31 December 1986, would not resolve the problem. The Council will realise that the share of each Member Nation in surplus applied to the arrears outstanding and the contributions due in 1987. As regarding countries with arrears of contributions there would thus be no net cash flow benefit. There would only be a benefit if those Member Nations who are not in arrears and pay their 1987 contributions in full are prepared to relinquish their share of the cash surplus. This can be done voluntarily. There would be no need for a special session of the Conference to be convened to deal with this matter. The Council is invited to consider and note the serious situation regarding the liquidity and urge Member Nations to pay their contributions due in full and on time. In the circumstances, the Director-General has no alternative to the programme adjustments on the lines and on the scale proposed, as well as the other measures he has The situation will remain fluid. We to the contributions actually received. It is precisely for this reason that the Director-General has convened, as you have just heard, a special session of the Finance Committee to meet on 15 and 16 D ecember of this. -116- year. The Programme and Finance Committees will have thei r usual two sessions in 1987 and the Council itself will have the opportunity of reviewing the situation and requirements in June and November of voudrais parler document CL 90/23. Octavio Rainho da SILVA NEVES (Brazil): I would just like to recall briefly the main points, perhaps if you would allow me, of my previous intervention that are now somewhere lost in this difficult discussion. I would like as well to thank both the Chairman of the Finance Committee and Mr Shah for the very helpful explanations and contributions. One of the points that we tried to develop in our previous intervention concerned this overall question of this liquidity crisis facing the organization is that the Worst features of the present situation are the certainty that the largest contributor is not going to pay its full contribution due to FAO and the uncertainty regarding the time and announcement of present and future payments by that member. Another point, and I will be quite brief, that we tried to stress but, whereas whole conformed to the rules of the international organizations and were justified by the commodity of goods and by the currency scarcity in developing countries, they have major problem to FAO's activities as the largest, making up to the past in any single way to the contribution of recent years of around 20 million dollars, and I would suggest once more that we consider this in itself an extraordinary performance given the financial uncertainty faced by the majority of the developing members of this organization. The point is that if the contribution by the main contributor to the organization is paid the financial situation of the organization will improve in relation to that of the five pr eceeding years. The liquidity crisis is not of itself in our view attributable to the arrears or the delayed payment by developing countries. That is why we take some exception with the suggestions in the report of the Finance Committee in document CL 90/17 paragraph 31 when they suggest some three specific measures to take and they would examine those measures at a subsequent session to take care of the matter in connection with prompt payment of contributions. I do not see how any of those suggestions, any of these ideas by the Finance Committee is going to solve the main point, our main problem and the problem that we are concerned with, the probable non-payment of the future contribution, or a large part of the future contributions by the main contributor. All the measures envisaged here by the Finance Committee, let us say they have an historical connotation but they do not adjust themselves to this new situation. So from this point of view, with all due respect to the Finance Committee I take exception to those measures. Taking into account the seriousness of the prompt presented by the to curb the most immediate difficulties faced by the organization. At this point we wish to present our support for the programme adjustments proposed of th e order of 16. 4 million dollars, or 3. 7 percent of the budget for 1986/87. As the Director-General pointed with document CL 90/23 we would prefer as well to have no adjustments at all but as they are necessary we prefer that they address consultancies, services and travel where they would do the least damage to the approved Programme of Work. We deeply appreciate that the technical and economic programmes have not been touched. Brazil, as well as all the other developing member countries of this organization, has been a strong supporter of the Technical Cooperation Programme: a very universal programme that FAO to intervene rapidly and give the necessary relief in the case of emergency and support to development-oriented projects. Once more I think the intervention made by Mr Shah in connection with TCP was once more quite helpful. In order to facilitate the needed consensus and to help the Director-General to overcome the present difficulties, my delegation would make no additional comments on savings or on the We prefer to offer our unconditional support to the proposal, cons idered that the Director- General is sufficiently aware of FAO's needs at present the person suited to monitor programme adjustments. -117- We support also the proposal for drawing on the wo rking capital fund for an to a strong United Nations system and to FAO. We do believe that all member countries should participate in equal terms in the work of United Nations international agencies and no country or group of countries should be allowed to have an undue influence on decision-making mechanisms. We must preserve rules and we have constructed during the course of more than 40 years. In accordance with your ruling, Mr Chairman, we will come later on to the next point of the agenda concerning this financial situation. Eiichi KAWAHARA (Japan): I should here like to make a very few brief remarks on the subject of the utmost importance which has exercised the minds of many of us in recent months. I wish to give my government's view on how we might deal with the substantial shortfall that is foreseen in contributions and the assessment for 1986 and 1987. I should like to refer to the matter of contributions first. According to the report of the 58th Session of the Fi nancial Committee the position at the end of September 1986 regarding 1986 assessments of Member Nations indicated the best performance for the last five years. This is no mean achievement given the fiscal difficulties is available, these Member Nations, including the largest contributor, had s till not made contributions under their 1986 assessment. I fully support the Finance Committee's earnest appeal to all Member Nations with contributions in arrears to honour their obligations to the FAO and to take urgent action now to give the amount due so as to ensure effective implementa tion of FAO activities in th e financial period 1986/87. Japan is unable support prop by efforts relating to the total current budget. In this connection I wish to refer to the relationship of the TCP appropriations to the FAO budget as a whole. We recognize that the Technical Cooperation Programme can play valuable roles as a rapid meet unforeseen needs in the developing countries. Nevertheless, reservations and the hopes that there will be a review of the rapid growth of the TCP budget item have been expressed. I wish to draw the attention of the members of the Council to page 23 of the 1984/85 financial report and statement of the FAO Regular Programme document C 87/5. Statement one gives the budget appropriations for TCP during year as around $72 million, but actual disbursements amounting to no more than an approximate amount of $26 million. An unutilized balance 45. 6 million dollars has consequently been carried forward for use in the current financial period. If one adds these transferred financial resources to the TCP budgetary appropriations already approved for the current period, which is 61. 42 million US dollars, the total TCP appropriation thus available for the current financial year exceeds 100 million US dollars. We congratulate the Secretariat on the efforts made for TCP programme savings of around 45 million dollars in the preceding financial period, savings which are greatly to be given the unprecedented shortfall envisaged for contributions we should consider the advantages of using ensure that FAO may continue to maintain a sound and solid financial foundation across the board. I should also like to mention the need in this connection for the evaluation of TCP programmes already implemented in order that TCP effectively as possible. We would greatly appreciate it the would stage its proposals for such being studied. alternative in the medium and long. term , we would at a ABDELHADI autorisation, la et de l'Organisation et les Comit\u00e9 financier dont nous de tous contributions, dans le paragraphe du du document qui fait l'objet de notre examen.

Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros tenemos un problema para el enfoque de la discusi\u00f3n. Despu\u00e9s de la presentaci\u00f3n del informe del 57 y 58 periodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, creo que lo que nos corresponde es aprobar o rechazar lo que nuestros representantes en ese Comit\u00e9 han aprobado ya previamente y no entrar en un an\u00e1lisis de auditor\u00eda, que no se puede llamar externa, sino auditor\u00eda de Consejo. Creemos que la presentaci\u00f3n por parte del Embajador Bukhari constituy\u00f3 un an\u00e1lisis muy sencillo y muy claro de la real problem\u00e1tica que presenta la Organizaci\u00f3n con respecto a la situaci\u00f3n financiera. De aqu\u00ed se sacan las conclusiones, de aqu\u00ed se sacan problemas fundamentales que nos ha presentado con brillantez y objetividad el se\u00f1or Crowther y el se\u00f1or Shah. Con estas tres presentaciones nosotros quisieramos hacer solamente un compendio con enfoques objetivos; a que se ha compendiado la situaci\u00f3n de crisis financieras provocadas, podemos aclarar que no hay una crisis financiera de la Organizaci\u00f3n, que es una crisis provocada. Nosotros queremos insistir, apoyando totalmente lo expresado por el Embajador del Brasil, en el sentido de que es necesario ver diferencias, y que esta crisis que se atravies a la provoca uno s\u00f3lo de los contribuyentes, precisamene el m\u00e1s importante, esto es una peque\u00f1a casualidad, por lo que creeemos que debemos hacer diferencias a la hora de enfocar los problemas. Hay precedentes de c\u00f3mo se vienen retrasando o difiriendo los pagos y c\u00f3mo se van tambi\u00e9n llegando a pagar; pero en el caso que se nos presenta de unilateralidad de uno de los grandes contribuyentes, del principal contribuyente, que inclusive presenta como condici\u00f3n de su no pago la legislaci\u00f3n de su pa\u00eds, legislaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n de problemas internos de su pa\u00eds, nos hace pensar dos veces la situaci\u00f3n que tenemos enfrente. Creo que esto es lo principal, analizar. 0 sea, que estamos en la obligaci\u00f3n de reprobar la actitud unilateral del principal contribuyente. Queremos aclarar, sin embargo, que para nosotros sin un an\u00e1lisis, dir\u00edamos directo de esta situaci\u00f3n, no podemos analizar la problem\u00e1tica del no pago de ese contribuyente. Se nos hace muy dif\u00edcil juzgarlo sin o\u00edrlo. Por lo tanto quisi\u00e9ramos que nos hablara espec\u00edficamene sobre el problema del no pago de un contribuyente. Nos reservamos el derecho de volver a intervenir cuando ese contribuyente hable porque es dif\u00edcil juzgarlo si no olmos las razones que debe tener. Independientemente de esta situaci\u00f3n, ya esta ma\u00f1ana se han expresado opiniones sobre los otros temas. Queremos decir que nuestra delegaci\u00f3n apoya en todas sus partes, despu\u00e9s de analizados, los documentos que nos ha presentado la FAO y despu\u00e9s de m\u00faltiples discusiones, que hemos hecho inclusive en el seno de nuestro Grupo Latinoamericano y del Caribe, apoyamos en todas sus partes las medidas propuestas por el Director General para evitar la crisis de liquidez de inmediato, sin afectar a las bases fundamentales del Programa que es el objetivo. Apoyamos, adem\u00e1s, esas alternativas que el Director General nos propone y que se analizaron brillantemente por el se\u00f1or Shah, donde se expresa claramente que no se va a tocar el Programa de cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica. Esto no es un capricho del Director General. El Director General es persona din\u00e1mica, valiente, audaz, pero nunca lo he visto en el plano caprichoso, siempre ha sido realista y el realismo est\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n del PCT, es una realidad de la transferencia tecnol\u00f3gica directa, f\u00e1cil y oportuna que piden los gobiernos, que no nos impone nadie. Nosotros hemos o\u00eddo algunos criterios contrarios a los Programas de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica, lo venimos oyendo desde hace algunos a\u00f1os. No creo que la coyuntura de esta crisis ha alentado a querer enfrentar el Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica. Tenemos experiencia de otras sesiones del Consejo y Conferencias en que hemos tenido que defender los Programas y no hab\u00eda crisis de liquidez en aquellos momentos. Por lo tanto no creo que debemos unir esto con la crisis. -120- Queremos decir, que creemos que hay una peque\u00f1a diferencia entre los que consideramos que los proyectos de cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica son utiles, que deben seguir increment\u00e1ndose y los que niegan su existencia y su mecanismo. Esta peque\u00f1a diferencia es la de los que la necesitamos y la de los que no la necesitan. Los que los necesitamos, y utilizamos, y pedimos a FAO que los aumente y que no se toquen, son los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo. Los que niegan su utilidad, todav\u00eda no me han convencido con razones, porque no saben explicar las razones, porque expresan criterios eminentemente te\u00f3ricos, fuera del programa, porque ellos ni han implementado ni han sido sujetos de proyectos de cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica. Si la situaci\u00f3n critica mundial llegara a tal punto de que fueran sujetos, nosotros estar\u00edamos de acuerdo en que la FAO les diera proyectos de cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica para que salieran de su crisis econ\u00f3mica. Queremos decir que a veces el alto coeficiente de inteligencia nubla los sentidos y hay que ser m\u00e1s objetivos. No podemos ligar cuestiones que no est\u00e1n en estos momentos en discusi\u00f3n. Posteriormente, despu\u00e9s de que hable la distinguida representante de Estados Unidos, dar\u00e9 mi criterio para poder calificarle de unilateral, aunque ya hay un principio que puedo adelantar, porque hay una cifra que aprob\u00f3 el Co mit\u00e9 de Finanzas y esa cifra nos dice que hay unos 83 millonee pendientes de cuentas corrientes y de esos 83 millones, de acuerdo con la cuota que le corresponde a ese gran pa\u00eds que es de 51, 5, se mantiene la proposici\u00f3n que planteaba nuestro querido Embajador de Brasil de que solamente el 20 por ciento corresponde al resto de los pa\u00edses. Esta es una cifra que yo quisiera que se me aclarara si no es real como est\u00e1 en los documentos. Esto es todo por ahora. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I cannot resist saying a few words now but I hope that we can reserve for later a more technical response to some of the most important and interesting interventions that we have been listening to. Concerning this particular intervention, I must say in good friendship and good humour that it is pretty hard to be scolded because you have been giving too much money over all these years. I mean, that is the trouble. In times of difficulty we do not expect to find strong things said against those who do not give anything or those who want to be Members and still never make up their arrears. To me that would be something very understandable. Of course, I am joking now because I understand how people feel. It is hard. It is also hard for some countries where one person can say \"give, I sign\", to understand how difficult it is in another country where 435 people are in charge of the money, 435 people who have to get elected every two years, and this is a problem also. We have to have understanding-one of the other. I understand that there is a certain amount of resentment obviously that we who have been, we may say, the major support in all this, have found this I hope, temporary, difficulty- although we do not know what Congress will say. I hope that they too will understand that we sit in a different seat and we have different powers and different abilities to respond. So, you scold people, dear friends, who do not give. Stop scolding us. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie Mme la pour qui financier ainsi que les explications compl\u00e9mentaires donn\u00e9es par M.

En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la FAO ne Denmark. We have noted the wish of the Secretariat and of you, Mr. Chairman, to divide the debate into two parts. We would have preferred more broadly to comment on both short-term and long-term measures since we believe they are somewhat interrelated and that it may also save some time. However, we shall comply with your ruling. May I start by thanking the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr Crowther and Mr Shah, for their introduction to this important agenda item on which we have received a number of documents, some immediately before this meeting. We accept that the financial situation of FAO is difficult, but at this stage not yet to the extent as described by the Secretariat.-It is, however, an excellent opportunity to have a thorough and comprehensive discussion of the situation in the Council, FAO's governing body, in order to provide guides to the Finance Committee and to the Secretariat on appropriate measures to be taken within the next year as well as in the long term. Parts of the problem have existed for some time. As stated in the documentation, unpredictability of payments from a number of contributors, including the one, is an important factor in influencing the liquidity of FAO and other UN agencies. exchange problems. We are living world subject and unpredictable changes. Therefore, member states should refrain from adding to these uncertainties and instead support United Nations agencies in their longer-term aim of carrying out their approved programme of work. We cannot accept unilateral decisions not to meet international financial obligations. Turning now to the short-term measures proposed by the I will concentrate from the Working Capital Fund of $13 million. Like other United Nations agencies, FAO is undoubtedly forced to make some programme adjustments. Let me say at once that the Nordic countries are not impressed by the proposals concerning the programme saving of $16. 4 million. It is impossible for us to judge from the documentation whether it is the appropriate level, and I want to stress that it is the responsibility of the Director-General to the technical backstopping and servicing of programmes are measures which have only very limited justification. In the short term FAO may save some money by reducing its servicing activities in relation to the volume is a deliberate and visible choice between programmes. In the future , we must insist on that kind of priority saving. We agree to the proposed transfer of $13 million from the Working Capital Fund. It goes without saying that we cannot a ccept TCP as a high priority goal in itself. It should rather be an ad hoc support for achievement of the more long-term goals of the Organization's programme of the process of making economies. In connection with the cash situation of FAO, we have some difficulties in fully understanding the stated gravity of the problem. This might be due to lack of information. From the financial statement, document C 87/5 Vol. 1, we note that the total cash of FAO at the end of the biennium 1984/85 amounted to some $300 million. we cash disposal is in the range $300-400 million, which is a rather large amount, probably too large in normal circumstances. While we acknowledge prudent cash management, we feel there is a need for having a detailed breakdown of the bank deposits in order to know about their composition and degree of liquidity, and before being able to take any position on short-term measures. We would appreciate further clarification on that point\u00b7 In closing, let me stress that the matter before us is. of direct concern to each and every Member State. It is not an East-West nor a North-South issue; it is a matter of common interest and concern, and the Nordic countries wish to underline that whatever measures of reform one undertakes, the financial liability of our Organization can only be fully restored and secured if all member states pay their assessed contributions in full.

I hope that all the members of this Council now know as much as we know, as members of the Finance Committee, about the situation. Usually in Italy, as in many other countries, we say that the host should take care of the guest's health, so that if the guest has a headache or something the host should call the doctor. As Mrs Fenwick was speaking a few hours ago I was just thinking of what would happen if the host country were still the same as it was at the beginning of the life of this Organization and I would like, as many of us, to recall how important and how determining the aid of that LC has been, the largest contributor, for the life and activities of this organization; so as she did, I would also remind the Council that many countries have their own parliament and sometimes the executive cannot change what parliaments will decide: the legislative power is the real power to determine what has to be done. Now it is not our task to decide what has caused what; but we have to face the reality that has been given in very crude terms to us as members of the. Council, and before that to the few who have the privilege to serve in the Finance Committee. As a member of the Finance Committee my delegation has no major comments on the report that our Chairman Bukhari summarized and we have to concentrate -125- on the shortfall that in September was not as tragic as it appears today. The expected shortfall in September did not imply any cash flow problem at all, so that at that time we just suggested, apart from the appeal we launched to arrears, that the Director-General by managerial means present to us some proposals of savings in order to face any turn of events. I will repeat that at that time there was no cash flow problem which arose when the Director-General told from contributor. Now the uncertainty at the present stage is still there. We do not know exactly, as the ambassador of the largest contributor told us, we do not know yet what will be the real contribution; but let us face reality and the reality shows that, according to the figures that were projected for us in that spirit of transparency that the Secretariat has always shown, we immediately got the projection until the end of 1987 of what wo uld be the situation in the various branches and funds of the Organization. At that time the projection was for a cash balance general fund active of 9.3 million dollars. And by that time the special reserve account, on account of the dollar lira fluctuating rate, was minus 0. 9. I have never seen a special reserve. fund in the minus in my life, in the red, but it happens here. The situation changed when the Director-General told us that he had find a way to offset th e expected problem of cash flow of over $25 million. He has proposed savings of 16. 4 dollars and a shift from the working capital fund of 9 million dollars. to the cash balance general fund and, according to my calculations. (I do not know whether Mr Shah finds them correct or not). I see it as 9.3 plus, offset by 34. 7 munus, which would bring about 25.4 So figure the Director-General is proposing these savings and a shift from the working capital fund. I think if these figures are correct, it is not a minor problem, and, as a conscientious member of this Organization, may I say for the delegation of my country, as host country for the Organization, that we must take these needs into consideration. It happened to FAO in 1983, to ILO in 1986. In both cases the deciding body, the sovereign body had to decide. Unfortunately the Council does not have the power to change the budget or change the regula tions of any time. We can give very competent advice, but that is all, we can recommend, but nothing else. So we have to give the advice that the Director-General is asking of us and we cannot follow the example of 1983. Let me just mention the case: in 1983 there was a resolution which has been mentioned in our documents, Resolution 14/83 which took of a certain number of countries. By and large we are in the same situation with one change, one difference, that the situation now is affected by the arrears the of special reserve account because of the fluctuation of the dollar. So the reasons why that resolution adopted for a biennium and giving the Council the power to suspend certain regulations in 1963 is practically the same, however the problem was minor vis-\u00e0-vis our difficulties of today. Only three or four months ago, ILO had to face another situation which was due to another reason, the tremendous depreciation of the US dollar in terms of Swiss francs and the ILO Council, they call it governing body, made a recommendation to the Assembly which met a month later and the Assembly took a decision to use the whole cash surplus to offset the tremendous loss of power of the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the Swiss franc. Now none of these occasions is at hand for us because our Conference is one year away. My delegation had thought that it would be the case to call for an extraordinary Conference; but no consensus was reached, so I do not dare to re-propose it here. We promoted the idea because the Conference could have taken the necessary measures. So we are facing this situation of a cash flow problem and the Director-General has made some proposals and expressed his approach, which we support. Our first worry is to limit the extent, the possible extent of damage to any of the expectations by the developing countries that are counting on programmes to be regularly developed, or on the implementation of technical cooperation projects. It is a very difficult exercise for the Secretariat to find a way not to touch them, but I see these are also the intentions of the Director-General not to impair or compromise any of these programmes. And coming to what the Director-General suggests, I must say very frankly as I am used to doing in this body, that we, like the Nordic countries, are not very much impressed by the amount of these savings, 16. 4 million dollars, of which 6.5 for not filling vacant posts, etc. If I recall rightly, in the last meeting of the Finance Committee, we had asked the Director-General to present us a programme of savings by managerial means without the need to cut anything -126- in the programme substantially, and that was before the bad news of further shortfalls had reached us. I mean the bad news of a cash flow problem which was not yet envisaged at that time. So 1 would first of all, in the name of my delegation, encourage the Secretariat and possible managerial other savings, possibly before the Finance Committee meets again, and again I am also very glad to find in this list of savings a little contribution by my country. Now and here immediately I can say that we have the approval of the Italian Government for the utilization of part of the balance of the Italian special contributions. As you know, we are not obliged to spend any money for the additional premises that the Organization needs. This applies to all international organizations, such as the United Nations, UNICEF, etc. when they want more space, they pay for it, and not the least is the host country obliged to pay for it. Nonetheless we have been giving for 15 years special contributions and in document CL you have the figure, 2 millio n 163 thousand dollars\", so as of now, I say if Italy will agree to this by an exchange of letters. In addition, the Italian special contribution that is mentioned page 10, document CL 90/17, paragraph 57 of the Report of the Finance Committee for the month of September, and I a s uplementary one-time allocation fo r 1986 of Lire 1 billion\", which is approximately 700 thousand dollars. We also agree that this amount be treated as part of the budget; part of the miscellaneous income, whatever is the financial means to use it in the budget for relief. So it is another way to relieve. But we will not stop at that. I think that as responsible donor countries in this body, we should go beyond that. So I would refer to a paragraph of the same report of our beloved Finance Committee, page 6, paragraph 24. The last renouncing or delaying the r eceipt of their share of the cash surplus in order to permit its use by the Organization\". I think that in addition to the almost 3 million dollars that I just mentioned, we could inform the Council, as a contribution of ideas, that the Italian delegation is strongly considering that possibility. We just need the green light. The Director-General thought that it would be better to have this discussion in two phases this week-telex to the Government, answer by the Government, and answer to the Council-and next week we will be in a position to tell you whether this consideration will be approved by the Ministries concerned. As Mrs Fenwick was remarking for her country, we are also not a country in which one man decides. We have a parliament and we have many persons who decide on measures of this kind. So the measure of coming in aid of the situation of the cash flow of the Organization, so that the Organization may be relieved somewhat, is to say that we do not pretend that the 1987 assessed contribution of Italy would be diminished by the amount that is owed to us by the Organization on account of the cash surplus of 1984/85. This is what we are expecting to be allowed to tell the Organization. It is not a multilateral affair, because we are not asking Council backing, or permission, or prohibition: we are just announcing it as a contribution to the ideas that we are trying to shape up here. It will be a bilateral affair, Italy/FAO. Finally, we are also going to accelerate the full payment of our 1987 contribution. Usually it is paid in April, but we would like to do our very best so that the necessary procedures be completed before in order for the Organization to have this cash in 1987 earlier than in previous years. I hardly need to say that we have no arrears, we are in the lucky position of having no arrears, so Mr Shah will be glad to notice that our offer is not just 'blah-blah-blah': it is a real offer, because this cash contribution will be handed over to the Organization with no cuts if our proposal is approved by the beginning of next week in this way. But, until then, Mr Chairman, will our cash surplus share be left with FAO? Our sovereign body is called the Conference of FAO, and the Conference is meeting in November of next year. One way or another we must find a way to restore the 100 percent contributions. Now if you add the percentage of the quotas, you do not reach 100. When I hear Mr Shah saying that this is a real cut, this is what we mean: it is a real cut and we think it is wrong to carry out this shortfall in contributions by whatever country as arrears. In a case where a legislative -127- body by enacted law has decided to cut, no human being can redress the situation: that will be a cut-period. So the 100 percent budget for 1986/87 is cut-I do not know, to 83 or 84 percent. We shall have, one way or another, to revise the quotas to reach 100 if we want to maintain the healthy operation of this indispensable Organization for the benefit of the agricultural and food situation in the world.

Asimismo felicitamos y agrad ecemos al se\u00f1or Crowther y al se\u00f1or Shah por la presentaci\u00f3n de este tema y por las aclaraciones que recibimos en la ma\u00f1ana de hoy. Es lamentable que hoy, cuando millones de seres humanos se enfrentan con el hambre cr\u00f3nica y que la crisis econ\u00f3mica condena a la miseria la mayor parte de la humanidad, este Organo, el Consejo de la FAO, deba dedicar su actitud prioritaria a resolver problemas de liquidez que se prev\u00e9n en el futuro. Esos problemas surgen en buena parte y unilateralmente por leyes promulgadas en un pa\u00eds que determinan incumplir con las obligaciones internacionales y que violan as\u00ed la Constituci\u00f3n de los Organismos de Naciones Unidas. -129- Esas decisiones llevan consigo la p\u00e9rdida de credibilidad en la seriedad de ese pa\u00eds que al votar la Constituci\u00f3n de este Organismo admite la superioridad de su ley internacional. La crisis econ\u00f3mica en aquel pa\u00eds, su alto d\u00e9ficit presupuestario, su enorme deuda se extiende y castiga las econom\u00edas y la efectividad inclusive de los organismos creados por la humanidad para resolver precisamente esos y otros problemas. Pero no hay disculpa cuando s\u00ed se pueden aumentar alarmantemente los recursos armamentistas. Por otro lado, pa\u00edses subdesarrollados, con situaci\u00f3n financiera cualitativa y proporcionalmente m\u00e1s grave, est\u00e1n haciendo un gran sacrificio para responder a sus compromisos, a pesar de que flujos multimillonarios netos de capital son succionados hacia econom\u00edas industrializadas; o bien alabamos la actitud de otros pa\u00edses industrializados que hacen el mejor de sus esfuerzos por responder noble e incondicionalmente a los altos objetivos de Naciones Unidas. Que nadie se equivoque, los problemas de liquidez que probablemente enfrentaremos no conforman una crisis en FAO porque se origina fuera de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n y en muy buena medida en las decisiones, como he dicho, unilaterales de aquel pa\u00eds y de sus objetivos. Son precisamente esos objetivos los que deben distinguirse de las razones que han llevado a otros pa\u00edses a retrasar o a suspender sus pagos a esta Organizaci\u00f3n. Se busca y se ha declarado imponer un castigo al sistema de Naciones Unidas a fin de ejercer un control mayor sobre \u00e9l y debilitar o eliminar los programas operativos que no respondan directamente a intereses o a un manejo directo. Ciertos pa\u00edses se han unido tambi\u00e9n a esa actitud. En \u00e9poca de crisis es f\u00e1cil coincidir en que deben racionalizarse recursos y hacer mas eficientes los programas; de hecho, conforme m\u00e1s radical se hace ese criterio m\u00e1s superfluo, innecesario o inconveniente puede aparecer y puede convertirse la ejecuci\u00f3n de programas y actividades; en el extremo de los absurdos todo puede suprimirse. Nos oponemos a la intenci\u00f3n de esos pocos pa\u00edses que proponen como programa la reducci\u00f3n de la atenci\u00f3n efectiva que da esta Organizaci\u00f3n a las necesidades precisamente de aquellos que hoy enfrentan el hambre y la muerte, y buscan como soluci\u00f3n atropellar los derechos de los gobiernos que hoy puedan hacer valer su voz y su voto equivalente para que se respete aunque sea su opini\u00f3n. Si he dramatizado, se\u00f1or Presidente, ha sido como respuesta a la impotencia. Buena parte del fanatismo que recorre hoy el mundo seguramente as\u00ed se explica. El hecho es que debemos aceptar econom\u00edas y hacer previsiones financieras para el futuro; el objetivo, pues, consiste en afectar lo menos posible aquellos programas o actividades que beneficien m\u00e1s directamente a los que deben ser beneficiados. Hemos revisado el ejercicio hecho por el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y el paquete de recortes propuesto por el Director General. Tal paquete descrito en el documento CL 90/23 y que monta 16, 4 millones de d\u00f3lares previsibles nos parece aceptable y, lo apoyamos, no porque coincidamos con una po l\u00edtica de contracci\u00f3n de los programas de la Organizaci\u00f3n, ni tampoco con cada propuesta de recorte, sino porque tales econom\u00edas son, como lo dijo el Director General, una necesidad de facto. Lo apoyamos tambi\u00e9n porque una discusi\u00f3n sobre detalles entre m\u00e1s de 50 Estados Miembros aqu\u00ed reunidos ser\u00eda inconveniente, interminable y confusa. Lo aprobamos tambi\u00e9n porque tenemos confianza en la actitud responsable de la Secretar\u00eda y del Director General. En todo caso, nos interesa conocer con antelaci\u00f3n todo recorte o reestructuraci\u00f3n futura a fin de estudiarlo y dar nuestra razonada respuesta. Es imperativo hacer respetar el principio de universalidad y de equilibrio entre todas las regiones en las actividades y asistencia que otorga la FAO. Esperamos que los Comit\u00e9s de Programa y de Finanzas eval\u00faen a fondo los impactos de los recortes propuestos y nos mantengan informados, particularmente sobre futuras necesidades de hacer econom\u00edas; pero subrayo: hay programas que est\u00e1n en el coraz\u00f3n mismo de la FAO y que nos oponemos a que se toquen; tal es el caso del PCT en vista de que su impacto en los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados es tan importante. Desear\u00edamos, inclusive, que esta asistencia por parte de FAO siguiera creciendo y que respondiera m\u00e1s a las prioridades que le hemos dado los pa\u00edses beneficiarios y tambi\u00e9n que se le diera una mayor agilidad a su aprobaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n. Asimismo apoyamos, y no entrar\u00e9 en detalles, otros programas que est\u00e1n ligados \u00edntimamente a la promoci\u00f3n de la seguridad alimentaria mundial. -130- Observamos, sin embargo, que si la FAO no se encuentra en una situaci\u00f3n financiera inmanejable es precisamente porque se ha llevado a cabo una pol\u00edtica eficiente, cautelosa y transparente. Esa actitud responsable nos permite ahora prever con toda calma las medidas mas adecuadas para cumplir lo mejor posible con el Programa de Labores y Presupuesto aprobado por la Conferencia de 1985, respetando prioridades. Hemos tomado nota de los an\u00e1lisis hechos en los documentos CL 90/4, 90/17, 90/23 y observamos que tales recortes no afectan sensiblemente las prioridades, pero diferimos con aquellos delegados que afirman que estos recortes de todas maneras permitir\u00e1n a la FAO ejecutar sus programas normalmente; no es as\u00ed. Sentimos que s\u00ed los afecta, as\u00ed como la asistencia a nuestros pa\u00edses. Reconocemos que la negativa a pagar de un pa\u00eds, las demoras de otros, montan 93 millones de dolares en este bienio; se nos informa tambi\u00e9n que adem\u00e1s la reducci\u00f3n de las tasas de inter\u00e9s y de fondos invertibles conlleva una reducci\u00f3n del cap\u00edtulo de ingresos diversos de 19 millones de d\u00f3lares. Tambi\u00e9n que la devaluaci\u00f3n significativa del d\u00f3lar frente a la lira ha hecho descender la Cuenta Especial de Reservas\u00b7 Coincidimos con el objetivo de utilizar 13 millones del Fondo de Operaciones. Tomamos nota de la necesidad de enmendar los proced imientos actuales para la aplicaci\u00f3n del super\u00e1vit de tesorer\u00eda, y lo apoyamos en tanto que todos los pa\u00edses aqu\u00ed reunidos y por consenso renuncicmos voluntariamente al reintegro de tales excedentes calculados en cerca de 34 millones de d\u00f3lares; esto lo tratar\u00e9 de nuevo cuando pasemos al siguiente tema. En relaci\u00f3n al p\u00e1rrafo 31 del documento CL 90/17 coincido con lo expresado por el delegado de Brasil en el sentido de que no creemos que lo dicho ah\u00ed resolver\u00e1 nuestros problemas necesariamente. Apoyamos al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas cuando insta a todos los contribuyentes en mora a que hagan sus pagos lo m\u00e1s pronto posible con el fin de evitar la necesidad de nuevas econom\u00edas o, en \u00fa ltima instancia, de recurrir a cr\u00e9ditos. Pedimos al Director General que nos mantenga informados sobre tal situaci\u00f3n y lleve el exhorto ya expresado aqu\u00ed por muchos pa\u00edses a todos aquellos que aun se encuentran en tal situaci\u00f3n de mora. En todo caso, reconocemos la facultad del Director General de recurrir al cr\u00e9dito a corto plazo en vista de lo dispuesto por la Conferencia y en espera del pago de las contribuciones que a princi pios de 1988 se calculan en 95 millones de d\u00f3lares. Finalmente, volvemos a exhortar al mayor contribuyente a esta Organizaci\u00f3n a que busque f\u00f3rmulas para honrar los acuerdos constitutivos de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n y a que corrija lo que consideramos debido a la falta de credibilidad que conlleva un error hist\u00f3rico que, sin duda, la conciencia de su noble pueblo sancionar\u00e1. Horacio CARANDANG (Ph ilippines): proposals the Director- General regarding the use of the amount of 9 million from the Working Capital Fund and the programme adjustments which would yield economies of some 16. 4 million. The Council is empowered by FAO's Basic Texts to authorize withdrawals from finance expenses pending r eceipts of to the proposals the Director-General. The Philippine delegation believes that the conditions defined for the use of the Working Capital Fund have been met. Therefore the Council can authorize withdrawals from that Fund. competent collaborators have done their best to limit the damage to the Programme of Work, particularly to the economic and technical programmes. As the Director-General said, these adjustments have not been made at random. However, we regret that adjustments are now being made to the Programme of Work which all member countries approved during the Conference last year. It is not perhaps entirely true that adjustments have no implications on the Programme of Work. What the document is saying is that care has been taken so the damage to the economic and technical programmes is limited to the minimum and planning assistance, just to name a few. As the other delegations have said, the adjustments are the least evil. If a doctor has to make a choice between letting a patient die or cut off a finger, an eye, a nose or a toe, saying that we regret such adjustments are being made on a Programme of Work approved by all members of this Organization principally because of the unilateral action by one member country. aid-giving agency, and one of FAO's primary functions, as defined in Constitution Article I, 3(a), is \"to furnish such and represents the most important needs the FAO programmes into the Cooperation Programme. I believe record of disbursement the Technical Cooperation Programme is very favourable in comparison with other financial institutions. I do not believe that the old proposals already rejected regarding the nature of the contributions to the TCP should again be raised now. One member proposed another evaluation of the TCP, but we have just had an evaluation programme of the TCP at the 88th Session of the Council. I do not think that another evaluation is warranted, particularly in view of the financial crisis of the Organization. The Philippine delegation cannot but express its concern that the financial difficulties of the Organization are being caused by to honour their obligations to the Organization. Finally-and at this stage I am not making a proposal, I am just thinking aloud-the only sanction against late payment of assessments is of voting rights, after being in arrears of payment to the Organization, after payments equivalent to the assessment of four full years; but even that is avoided if the member pays just a part of that money at that time. Everybody is aware of the time value of money. Let us suppose that interest rates were at 5 percent and a owed the Organization $100 on 1 January but paid the money only at the end of the year, actually that member country has deprived the Organization of the opportunity of earning interest on that money over the duration of a whole year. If it paid it after two years, the value of that contribution would only be something like $90. 25; if it paid it three years later the value of the money that it owed would only be something like $85. 74; and in four years' time the value of that money is only $81. 45. In other wo rds, there is such a thing as a time value of money. Therefore, there should be a premium on early payment of dues and a penalty for late payment of assessed contributions. As I have said, this is just a thought which I am throwing out, but if a member pays all its contribution at the beginning of the biennium, I think that member is worthly of all praise and at the same time I think it should be given some incentive; but if a member country voluntarily delays payment over a long period of years, probably that member country merits some kind of sanction. But that is up to the member countries, to the Director-General and all to think about might be appropriate in the future. Milutin TAPAVICKI all, I should like to congratulate Ambassador Bukhari and Mr Shah introductory statements. The Yugoslav delegation would express its satisfaction with the findings and conclusions on financial matters at the last two sessions of the Finance Committee. In this connection, the problems of delayed contributions give the impact the recent unprecedented legislative action by the largest contributor on the financial situation of the UN system, including the FAO. The Finance Committee rightly emphasized payment a treaty obligation of all Member Nations and that other Member Nations should not be called upon to compensate for the deficit caused by reduced payment by any contributor. My delegation fully shares the appeal made by the Finance Committee to all Member Nations to make a special effort to remit their outstanding contributions to alleviate the impact on the Organization of the unilateral action of the largest contributor. In this connection, allow me to inform the members of the Council that the Yugoslav government has made such an effort to Committee's appeal. ago, our assessed contribution for 1986 paid in full. Therefore all delegations are kindly requested to remove the name of Yugoslavia from the list of outstanding contributions in document CL 90/17, Appendix solve to a significant extent FAO's financial crisis. We have before us the document on the Budgetary and Cash Flow Forecast Relating to the Programme of Work and Budget for 1986/87. Part 2 of the document indicates clearly the magnitude and, indeed, the nature of the crisis. Let me emphasize that we are not faced with a resource crisis but with the likelihood of severe cash flow problems towards the end of the biennium. -132- Given the nature of the crisis, the most logical step should be to resort to the existing mechanism devised for such a purpose, including the use of the authority to borrow. However, while we very much regret that prudent management; in other words, we believe that the package proposed in the document is appropriate. We appreciate that a reduction in TCP has not been proposed, and we share the view that TCP represents an indispensable instrument for translating FAO's programmes and and through the publications, consultancies, contractual services and travel. Having mind in cannot be avoided, the the approach and proposals made by the Director-General. Finally, as to the part of the United Kingdom statement about the ratio between programme delivery and delivery costs, I trust that Mr Shah's has fully settled the issue. Malikana Mike Let me begin by expressing my deep appreciation to the Chairman of the Finance Committee and the Secretariat and for the lucid manner in which they introduced the documents before us. I do not want to sound alarmist, but going through documents CL 90/4, 90/17 and 90/23, one is left with clear that the crisis of multilateralism is approaching the stage where the very existence of the UN system is threatened. The financial position of our Organization, as amply given in paragraphs 13 to 45 of document CL 19/17, is a source of grave concern to my delegation. The question that comes to mind is: what do we do next? In his address to the Council and, indeed, in the documents before us, the Director-General came up with specific proposals aimed at steering our organization from the current financial storms, at least in the short term. the timely and to deal with the current situation. However, I have a few comments and observations to make. First, the FAO effective budget for the biennium should, contributor recently passed limiting its contributions to the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It will be noted that the largest contributor took this action long after the Conference had approved the FAO budget for the 1986/87 biennium. This has put us in a quandary. By depriving FAO of funds we are not only jeopardizing its operation but indirectly making it also difficult for it to carry on with its noble task of fighting poverty, hunger, malnutrition, social and economic injustice. The importance of food need not be over-emphasized. Food comes first in all walks of human life. Any country needs well fed and healthy nationals to drive the wheels of economic, industrial and social development. It is in this context that I once again call upon the largest contributor to pay its share of the contribution due to FAO. As I mentioned earlier it is encouraging that the Director-General has already used his usual foresight inititative be taken to cushion the undesirable the current financial crisis. The Zambian Delegation supports his initiative in the proposals as laid down in document CL 90/23. However, we should like to stress that in trying make savings no programme, which has a beneficial the peasants of the be cut. In this in mind the Technical TCP a saviour to It is an effective quick action and positive programme in a time of human and natural disasters. Secondly, there should be no substantive revision of the Programme of Work and Budget approved by the Conference. The Director-General should use his managerial and administrative ability to cushion the serious effects of financial crisis. Across the board cuts should be avoided. A case by case approach is the best under the circumstances. The proposed programme adjustments, as shown at document CL 90/23, should only be used as a guide but not an authority. Should the situation become worse than anticipated, the guidance. -133- Thirdly, my delegation also sees no objection to the proposal to use the Working Capital Fund to cover delayed Member State payments. The idea be needs further circumstances, it is imperative that FAO should work out measures to reduce future financial crisis. The proposals should be submitted to the 91st Session of the Council for further study and consideration. We should begin to 1986/87 abolition of certain posts, may have to be taken in concert with what the mother body has already dono in New York. In conclusion, I feel that time has now come for self-inspection and criticism. My delegation's appeal is that no other State should withold its contribution to FAO this biennium. It is in times of crisis such as this when we all need to work together to overcome the challenges before us. The Director-General should, various governments who defaulting on their contributions so that they can clear the arrears of contributions to FAO as a matter of urgency. My experience with international organizations is that we spend a lot of time discussing about our contributions, but do very little to honour our obligations. This negative approach should come to an end if the international organizations, in which we are members, are to deliver the goods. With these few remarks, I wish to thank you once again for giving me the floor. Hermann REDL (Austria): I would like to thank the Director-General and his staff for a clear presentation of the financial situation of FAO. In particular, for referring to the difficulties ahead of us. I would also like to thank Ambassador Bukhari for his additional remarks. At the Conference in November, last year, not only the Programme of Work and Budget but also the shares of the Member Nations' contributions were decided upon. In this connection, I would like to draw your attention to Resolution 8/85. It is now our duty to stand up for this decision and to support the Director-General in his work. One prerequisite for this is the timely compliance with our financial commitments. Furthermore, I would like to refer to the provisions in the Financial Regulations C/5. 4 of the Basic Texts, reading as follows: the beginning of each calendar (c) request Member Nations and Associate Members, as the case may be, to remit all contributions and advances due. \" As can be seen from the latest FAO document CL 90/LIM/1-The Financial Position of the Organization-a number of Member Nations have, in line with the pertinent regulations of the Constitution, paid their contribution on time. Those Member Nations should not be punished for their orderly payments. I would like to take the opportunity of pointing out that we all have not only adopted FAO's budget 1986/87, the defaulting debtors provisions and ask them to implement their obligations in line with our rules. The proposals by the Director-General to solve our full most recent developments show that FAO activ ities have not only to be continued in the future, but also strengthened. The measures of programme adoption suggested by the Director-General arc undoubtedly a matter of high priority which will meet with our full support. We hope that TCP activities will continue as proposed by the Director-General, and approved by the Conference last year, for the benefit of the developing countries. In concluding, I may therefore remind the individual members once more of their reliability with the FAO for the biennium 1986/87 and ask them to discharg e these liabilities, if it has not yet been done, and to support the Director- General in the implementation of the budget adopted by all of us. Sjarifudin BAHARSJAH (Indonesia): Allow me to take the floor not only on behalf of my delegation, but also to represent the Group of 77. On this occasion I would like to present to the Council comments and suggestions with regard to the topics on hand and also to the statements made by the Director-General, in particular, concerning the financial crisis faced by the FAO, adjustment of the Programme of Work for the biennium 1986/87 and follow-up action of the Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. -134- Firstly, may I express my appreciation and admiration to Ambassador Bukhari and Mr Shah for their very lucid and useful report and explanation. Allow me to comment on the financial crisis of FAO which has grown to such proportions that it calls for a speedy and efficient solution. It is the responsibility of all members of the Organization to help find a solution. We all know that a smooth functioning of FAO in performing its task as formulated in its Constitution is, to a very large extent, dependent upon the availability of adequate financial resources member countries. by the Director-General the financial crisis affecting FAO at present is caused primarily by the fact that the member country with the largest contribution is going to reduce its contribution to FAO. There is also the drop in interest rates and the fact that the US dollar has weakened throughout the year and there remains, of course, the problem of arrears of contributions by member countries. The solution to the financial crisis should, first of all, be sought in the timely fulfillment of the financial obligations by that contributions commitment have assumed before FAO started implementing its Programme of Work in the 1986/87 biennium, which was approved by the Conference in its Plenary Session in November 1985. It is only logical that the contributions should be paid in full within the shortest possible a country, under the domestic problems be compelled to reduce organizations, such a move should not be applied to the present biennium. The reason is that the Programme of Work in 1986/87 was approved during the Conference in November 1985, assumption member countries determined by scale of their contributions. For this reason any substantial drop in the total of contributions to FAO, relating to the current biennium would, understandably, give rise to grave difficulties in the of the Programme of Work, and the developing countries as a whole would feel the harmful e ffects of the sudden incapability of FAO to pro ceed working according to schedule. In this regard the suggestion of the Director-General deserves serious consideration and he should be praised for the manner in which he dealt with the financial problem which is now a grave concern to the Organization. In connection with the foregoing, on behalf of the Group of 77, allow me on this occasion to appeal to all member countries of FAO to fulfill, in due time, their obligations in respect of their contributions. In particular to appeal to the member country with the largest contribution assessment, at least to postpone its plan to reduce its contribution to FAO, so that the work of the 1986/87 biennium would not be affected. We have been told that this is almost impossible, but it is only reasonable that we expect that all commitments large and small once made should be honoured. With regard to the strategy proposed by the Director-General in coping with the faced by FAO on a short-term basis involving the investment of programme of travels which are less urgent and through the use of the working capital fund, the Group of 77 considers these strategies acceptable with the understanding that these measures would not give rise to other problems. For instance, in the case of the postponement of the recruitment of staff, it should not in any way hamper the work of one unit or another. The same applies to the reduction of the number of publications, meetings, consultancies and travels which should be effected with the greatest care. After the Council has given its approval to the proposed strategies, their Director-General. After having dealt with the financial difficulties of FAO and with adjustment of the Programme of Work 1986/87 to the shrinking financial resources alLow me to draw your attention to the necessity for maintaining the Technical Cooperation Programme as it is now. To be specific I am suggesting that the TCP should not in any way be subjected to cuts in its financing. The reason is that TCP plays an important role in accelerating agricultural development in many developing countries. Since it came into being some ten years ago, the TCP has shown\" its usefulness in developing countries with agricultural training, preparation for investment, emergency advice, formulation of agricultural projects. Not less 2 044 projects were implemented under this programme during the period 1976 to 1984; twenty-seven projects a year in developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Near East and Europe. The advantages derived from those projects must by now have increased manifold. For instance, in the case of training, those workers who have once been trained under the programme are now organizing -135- training courses for others. There are also large projects which are to be considered as a follow-up to TCP projects. Recognizing the positive impact we welcome the statement by the Director-General to ensure the continuation of the TCP in the course of the biennium in accordance with the approval given to it in its session in 1985. With regard to the follow-up of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the economic crisis in Africa, in particular with respect to the proposal of the ministers of agriculture in African countries for the Director-General to undertake a study on aid-in-kind, the Group of 77 is pleased to support the proposal and suggests that the study should be extended to include other regions and donor countries as well. It is necessary to know the amount of need for aid-in-kind and its utilization in the recipient countries, but it is equally important the availability of staffs donor countries. These data the and for obtaining the highest results Director-General should therefore to such a study. Khalil M AKKAWI (Lebanon): Allow me first to say how delighted we are to see you back in this important Chair conducting our deliberations in the most efficient way. We are confident that under your wise leadership this Council will achieve positive and su ccessful results. Equally I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency the Chairman of the Finance Committee and Mr Shah for the excellent presentation they have made this morning and I am sure this is going to help to a great extent our deliberations. In reference to the item under discussion, which is the budgetary and cash flow forecast relating to the Programme and appreciates the fact that the Director-General drawn this serious matter to our attention. We share his concern. We are firmly of the that the problems affecting the implementation of the Programme of Work and Budget for 1986/87 stem from Member Nations not honouring their commitments agreed at our Conference, the highest governing body in this organization. We are aware that a number of Member Nations are not always in a position to pay their contributions each year according to the financial regulations of FAO. This happens in every biennium and they pay their contribution as soon as they can, either during the biennium or after. As a matter of fact, if I may say so, this is the case of my country, Lebanon. Everybody in this room is undoubtedly aware of our great difficulties, but in spite of this my government has taken the n ecessary steps to pay its full contribution for 1986, and I hope in the very near future. However, the problem that we are now facing arises from the fact that a shortfall in contribution represents one-fourth of our total budget it is no wonder that with any significant shortfall in its payment the organization faces a serious problem. We therefore join in the appeal made by the Finance Committee to all Member Nations and in particular to the largest contributor to honour their contribution obligations and to make their contribution as early as possible. We would face no problem if we were this would be heeded. However, the chances are most it will not. What aggravates the problem moreover is the fact we ar\u00e9 in an entirely fluid situation, not knowing what amount w ill be paid for 1986 and when it will be paid. We are even more in the dark as regard s 1987. We thus appreciate how the Director-General has exercised a constant vigilance order to foresee all possibilities. We appreciate as well the change in the situation as discussed by the Finance Committee barely two months ago from the prospects as seen today. In the circumstances we welcome the strategy proposed by the Director-General and give it our full support. We regret that in order to ensure the financial viability of the organization he has to propose programme adjustments which would yield US dollars. We are sure that every Member Nation who looks to FAO for support and assistante regrets this. The Director-General himself regrets this too. However, under the circumstances his proposal is a wise one, and one we should accept as a package. He has formulated this package with all due care, examining the possibilities for adjustment and the likely impact on programmes. We cannot possibly undertake such a review with an intergovernmental body. He has our confidence as the chief executive elected by us. We also accept the fact that he w ill need to draw on the working capital fund for an amount of 9 million US dollars pending receipt of the contributions. This is precisely one of the main purposes of the working capital fund and it w ill be done entirely according to the organization's resolutions. -136- Finally we the possibility that should the present estimate of income by the end of the present biennium not improve, the Director-General would need to borrow some 30 million US dollars in early 1988 to cover the usual obligations arising from commitme nts in 1987. The Director-Gener al, we are certain, has no desire to borrow. If he is forced to do so, it will be because Member Nations will not have paid their contributions. The remedy, therefore, is in the hands of these Member Nations. It is those who have created this problem who have the means of resolving it. We hope that wisdom will prevail. that, should the prospects indicated by the Director-General materialize, we give him full support in implementing the measures that he proposes. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): I think we can be since most of the delegates have already emphasized the points we want to make. But first of all, of course, I want to congratulate His Excellency Mr Bukhari and thank Mr Crowther and Mr Shah for their introduction to the item. I especially thank Mr Shah for the clarifications he has given this morning on the occasion of the debate we have all heard. Perhaps I will have the occasion to refer to his clarifications later on in my intervention. The situation is difficult. We all know it and I think most of us here are dealing with this problem, at least thinking about it since many days, if not weeks now and we thank the Director-General for the transparency, the very clear transparency on this subject which he provided us by briefing us, by giving all the necessary information beforehand. We well informed on all aspects of the question. Let us say that I do not want to dwell much on the causes of this financial difficulty. In our minds it is very clear that there is a single factor which induces us today to discuss this subject. It is the internal legislation of the largest contributor. There are, of course, two other factors; there are arrears in the contribution of other Member States and a shortfall in the miscellaneous income but in our eyes these arrears of other Member States are a recurrent situation and we completely agree with our colleague from Brazil when he said that it would not change the situation much if we made an appeal. Of course, we are for an appeal but even if everybody else has paid the situation will remain the same unless the largest contributor, let us say, takes back his step. Well, as for the miscellaneous income, the fluctuations in this I think are a conjectural factor and they would not, again, much change the situation. So with due respect to Madame Fenwick, of course, scolding did not cross our minds but perhaps if we cannot help, we are unhappy about the situation. So let me again not dwell too much on the causes but concentrate on the proposals of the Director-General. My delegation considers that these proposals are timely, they are logical and reasonable and we can a ccept them, agree with them en bloc , including all the elements of the strategies, that is the cuts, the adjustments of 16 million, having recourse to the working capital fund and, if the situation is not better by the end of the biennium, of resorting to borrowing. So we agree with all the points in the strategy and we thank the Director-General for these wise proposals. As many other delegations, we of course regret that you have to go along with these cuts in the programme, but we are confident that the Director-General has chosen the right economies-\"economies\" is not the right word, as we do not consider these cuts as economies, but necessary adjustments. So we trust him and his staff to have found the less hurting solution and we do not think discussion on the content of these cuts is advisable. In any case, my delegation is not in a position to do so and we do not think it will be useful. We understand that it will hurt. But we also want to say, as again, many other delegations have said, that we welcome the pledge of the Director-General not to reduce operations under the Technical Cooperation Programme. We all know that this is not a Programme by itself, but the main tool of all FAO programmes to be put into action. So we think that these will be the funds which will be less touched, if at all, and we welcome this pledge again. As I said, we completely endorse these short-term measures which are proposed by the Director-General. But our worry is not for this biennium. We think that the problems are serious and radical and we will face the most difficult situation not this biennium but startin g from 1988, but of course we will rese rve our comments on To begin my intervention perhaps I could make just a few remarks on our Agenda Item 12. 1, which covers the business of matters in addressing delayed contributions. I think that Item refers Report 90/17 which was so ably delivered to us by its Chairman, my good friend Atif Y. Bukhari. Within that report there is a few paragraphs and some tables which indicate that the Finance Committee has been considering a number of alternatives for the encouragement of members to pay their contributions in a timely way. This was referred to only briefly by one or two speakers today. Notably I remember the delegate from the Philippines. We too believe that there should be instituted a system which rewards those who pay their contributions in a full and timely fashion, not n ecessarily to punish those who do not do so but to give value for money when countries do pay those contributions. We think the Organization has had this matter under consideration for three or four years and perhaps it has been somewhat dilatory in not coming forward on the clear and substantive proposal before this time. We would certainly encourage this Council to give this matter some consideration, all the more so because of the great unlikelihood that we shall see in much easier to address the issue when there is not money at stake. Finally I would like to draw your attention to the belief that the International Civil Aviation Organization has adopted such a formula in September/October of this year. The document we have in front of us outlines in short terms that particular system but indicates that it has not as yet been adopted. With those few remarks perhaps I should turn to the matter of the financial situation as we are addressing it under Item 12. 1 (a). We believe that the financial crisis facing our Organization is not entirely a the contributor, has been with us for some 18 months or more and certainly prior to the establishment of our present Programme of Work and. Budget almost a year ago. This fact has not been lost on the United Nations itself, or indeed many of our sister agencies, who over the last number of months measures, term liability. We therefore grateful to the Secretariat, and to the Director-General in particular, for documents CL 90/23 and CL 90/24 which have been put before us and for the briefing which was provided to us some two weeks ago which provides a very solid basis for us, the shareholding membership of the corporation, as it were, to express our views of the actions we should and could take to meet the financial stringency and to best ensure the longer term continuity of the Organization and its important programmes. We hope our consideration of this issue can continue to be conducted in the best spirit of collaboration and open expression of views. We do not feel that it should in any event be a partisan or divisive this unfortunate atmosphere which have drifted in from one quarter or another. We, as members, will have differences of views, some very marked, but our guidance obviously w ill be sought by the Secretariat looking for a middle ground on which to base its proposals for future action. In this respect I shall address myself solely to the short-term measures as outlined document CL 90/23 and perhaps return later to discuss the longer term measures under Section of our Agenda. On the best short-term estimates that the Secretariat has very usefully provided it would appear that we have a shortfall of some $92 million in revenue to meet the budgeted expenditures through the end of the current biennium, of which only some 13 months is left to us. Of this $92 million our largest contributor requirements, so $64 million. We very much regret this and should like to underline both our view that the payment of assessed contributions is a solemn legal treaty obligation and to join our appeal with others even at this late date that our neighbours do their very best to honour this obligation. We should also like to add that if the stance of the withholding contributor is, in the parlance of North America, to deliver a message to us at FAO we should very much like to encourage them to give us a clear articulation of that message to see if there is some way that we can assist them. -138- Be that as it may, our first hard reality is the $92 million shortfall based on the evidence that we have in front of us, a number which if left untended is bound to cause major damage to a programme budget expenditure of some $400 million create/a longer mortgage on future biennia, most particularly that of 88/89. We have in front of us as a preliminary reaction a Secretar iat proposal to effect programme savings of $16. 4 million and to draw on the Working Capital Fund to the extent of its holdings of $13 million and to beque ath to the 1988/89 biennia some $60 million in dated obligations. of course will-be bookkeeping of $98 million I believe given to us today, comprised almost entirely arrears of contributor withholding will be the aforementioned $64 million. We have grave doubts on this proposal on several grounds. We do not know if the $64 million withholding, should that be the figure, can categorised as arrears. Does various as Secondly, the preliminary proposal would seem to assume that this major withholding is only a temporary aberration which will not recur in the 1988/89 and Our own perusal in the major contributor would not support this view. There may also be a muted presumption that at the end of the day sometime in 1988/89 or later, the ot her members of the Organization will step in to pick up the unsettled financial obligations, whether through increased assessments, through our shares and working capital funds or of surpluses left to us, to pick up the immediate major obligations left us by the major withholding country. While our country is always timely in paying its obligations and not infrequently generous in other respects, we do not in principle agree to paying directly or indirectly the obligations of in experiment of multilateralism. Finally, it seems to be implicit in the proposals before us that should all else fail it is better to spend big now and if the anticipated revenues do not materialise to make sudden and drastic programme reductions at some point in the future. We for one are reluctant to gamble with the longer term stability of the FAO in that way. Taken together these four scenarios lead us to the inevitable conclusion that a much greater attempt must be made now while we have a year at least in our current biennium to effect economies which will balance the financial hardship between the present and a mortgage on the future. In this regard my authorities indicate that the United Nations itself has proposed programme reductions of 7. 5 percent, the International Labour organization savings of 7. 5 percent, the World Health Organization 6. 5 percent, UNESCO 6 percent, UNIDO 11 percent, all of which seem to be in excess of the programme proposal that is in front of us at 3. 7 percent. I know that those figures that I have just read, given to me by my authorities, do not jibe in their entirety with those used by others, or forecast by the Organization, however, 1 believe there are different sets of figures in play. Nevertheless, we might have a quick look at the 3. 7 percent reduction, a figure of some $16. 4 million, composed, we believe, of six and a half million in staff costs and 9. 9 in other postponable or lower priority activities. We hope we are not un charitable in s uggesting that a very large part of the 6. 5 million in staff savings on the delayed filling of 250 vacant positions reflects to some large extent to an ongoing of a vacancy rate which runs somewhat in excess of the budgetary estimate. We have had occasion in the past to point to this anomaly which has, if we are correct, thrown considerable discretionary funds to the hands of the Secretariat. Be that as it may, we would propose that at minimum the Secretariat very seriously look at its figures once again with a prospect, we would suggest, of moving some n of debit envisaged in 1988/89, and transl ate that into a like amount of economies in the present biennium. Due to the complexities of the budget we would listen carefully to Secretariat suggestions on how this might best be done while at the same time conserving the priority elements of the essential elements of the Organization for its future benefit. It is our belief that this can largely be addressed in looking carefully at discretionary or Potential Savings in of the regional offices whose activities might to some very large degree be by country offices and/or Headquarters. We Cooperation Programme is extremely popular with most Members of the Organization but would draw to their attention that its expenditures are largely unprogrammed. I believe between only 20 and 25 percent of its expenditures are directed to emergencies, while the remainder of of less urgent activities. We should also like to point, if we could, to the very substantive remarks made by the United Kingdom today in its proposal on areas in which further savings can be made. We appreciate the views expressed by the Secretariat that there may be differences within the United Kingdom in the calculation of figures but we do hope that the message has not been lost and that there may well be virtue in looking again at some of the very substantive and profound things that were said. Our colleague also mentioned the Technical Cooperation on a weight commensurate with that particular station and in particular, our colleague in Denmark made some very useful points which I would also commend to the Council. Having said that, there is one matter that I have overlooked at this point, and that is the matter related to the drawing on the Working Capital Fund, I think to the extent of its capacity some 13 million being proposed. Whilst we appreciate that ready access to available cash resources is tempting in time of a crisis such as we are facing now, we feel on the other hand that recourse to this Fund in the circumstances is somewhat dubious. Our understanding is that the Working Capital Fund was largely designed for use early in a financial year when contributions or assessments were arriving at replenished almost immediately, certainly if not within the current fiscal period then in the very next. We feel that our present crisis is not caused so much by slow contributions or even by arrears. It is caused by something called\"withholding\", something sui generis , as it were, whose ultimate bank ability is very much an unknown quantity. We should also like to point out that the observation made in the Finance Committee report (paragraph 20 of document CL 90/4) that the UN's rather massive financial crisis can be attributed in part to the demise of its Working Capital Fund on the basis of using them when contributions were withheld by Members for one particular reason or another. Lest we think that the $13 million from the Working Ca pital Fund is ready money, I believe that it should be underlined that it is, in fact, a loan which according to the regulations must moment. In connexion we would be pleased to have confirma tion from the Secretariat that the $13 million loan from the Working Capital Fund is part th e $60 or $61 million projected unpaid obligations for the 1988/89 year . If it is not (and I see some shaking of heads up there) then we ar e looking at $73 or $74 million in unliquidated obligations in 1988/89, plus another 20 million-we can round it at 100 million perhaps. In summing up, I should like to say we deeply regret the prospect of the financial crisis facing our Organization and deplore the withholding actions which cause it, as being contrary to treaty obligation. While we know it is not quantifiable at this stage, we have the gravest doubts that we shall see such withheld early date, and perhaps even ultimately. Therefore, in our view, they cannot be regarded as arrears for credit bookkeeping purposes. In common with the Finance Committee, as stated in their document (paragraph 24 of document CL 90/4) we do not feel that other members should be called on to compensate for this deficit. In this connexion, we did note the very generous, forward, outgoing remarks put forward by the delegate of Italy with respect to its contributions to the Organization. Extra budgetary contributions of some $2 million are listed in our particular document CL 90/23. A further extra budgetary contribution of 750 000 to 800 000 in the present budgetary period. We note that such contributions have been a feature for the last fifteen years, I believe, according to the distinguished delegate of Italy. We should welcome some indication of what those particular budgetary contributions have been used for in periods other than this financial crisis period, and information as to whether they were directed for a specific purpose such as a subsidy of rent in one or other of the buildings around the city. If the delegate of Italy would be kind enough at some stage, indicate privately or otherwise, the source of such funds from Government's (from portion, perhaps) pleased of advice so I can advise my Government to see if some similar proposition would be entertained. I have my doubts that they would be appreciative of lowering our Overseas the proposals before us in document CL 90/23 are in our view deficient, in so far as the proposed inadequate programme savings, and thus have far too great an adverse consequence for the future financial health of the Organization. We believe that additional savings can be made and that these can be found, in large part, in discretionary expenditure portions of the existing budget. Finally, we feel use of the Working Capital Fund should be clarified, and particularly as indicated the repayment of the loan we will be making from that Fund. Guillermo Enrique GONZALEZ (Argentina): Deseo agradecer las presentaciones que en la ma\u00f1ana de hoy tuvieron a bien hacernos el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, Embajador Bukhari, y el Director de la Oficina de Presupuestos, Sr. Shah. Ambos han sido claros, precisos, y nos han ayudado a ver la verdadera magnitud del problema que hoy debemos enfrentar. Pretendo ser sumamente breve en mi intervenci\u00f3n puesto que numerosas delegaciones se han referido en extenso a puntos que mi delegaci\u00f3n deseaba tratar. Por ello, subrayar\u00e9 fundamentalmente la posici\u00f3n de mi delegaci\u00f3n ante las principales alternativas que hoy debemos estudiar en este Consejo. En primer lugar, creo que est\u00e1n suficientemente claras nuestras mentes, pero quiz\u00e1 sea oportuno repetir que la crisis que estamos enfrentando no es de la Organizaci\u00f3n. No se trata de que en la Organizaci\u00f3n haya habido una mala o una deficiente administraci\u00f3n, \u00e9sto se debe subrayar. En todo caso, la crisis proviene de la falta de entusiasmo, de la falta de prioridad, de la falta, de un apoyo sincero de algunos miembros de la Organizaci\u00f3n a la misma. Las dificultades financieras-cash flow , como se dice en ingl\u00e9s-que se prev\u00e9n a corto plazo reconocen varias causas. Se trata de una conjunci\u00f3n de hechos y acciones que nos llevan a esta situaci\u00f3n. Las fluctuaciones en el tipo de cambio han tenido un gran impacto negativo. Lo mismo ha sucedido con los menores ingresos recibidos en concepto de Varios como consecuencia de la baja de intereses, pero, de todas maneras,-y esto no podemos desconocerlo-la situaci\u00f3n que desencadena la crisis est\u00e1 referida concretamente a la perspectiva de que el primer contribuyente disminuya sus aportes en forma sustancial. Mi delegaci\u00f3n se permite con todo respeto unirse a las que ya lo hicieron para hacer un llamamiento al primer contribuyente para que realice un rean\u00e1lisis de la situaci\u00f3n evitando causar un da\u00f1o irreparable al proceso de desarrollo en el que esta Organizaci\u00f3n tanto contribuye. Confiamos en que habr\u00e1n otras ocasiones durante el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o para volver a discutir este tema en el caso de que esta irregularidad no se haya logrado corregir. Mientras tanto, el Director General de la FAO asume su responsabilidad y nos propone una serie de ajustes presupuestarios del orden de los 16, 4 millones de d\u00f3lares y que, aparentemente, ser\u00edan suficientes para superar el problema del cash flow durante el presente ciclo presupuestario. Mi delegaci\u00f3n apoya el paquete de medidas sugeridas y se permite, al mismo tiempo, proponer que no entremos a discutir el detalle de las mismas ya que ello llevar\u00eda mucho tiempo y estoy seguro que no podr\u00edamos llegar a un resultado mejor que nos deje a todos igualmente satisfechos o, mejor dicho, igualmente insatisfechos, pues estas medidas se adoptan exclusivamente frente a una emergencia. En este sentido, mi delegaci\u00f3n, por lo menos, no tiene inconveniente en que la Secretar\u00eda contin\u00fae estudiando el tema y pueda eventualmente hacer otros ajustes adicionales, siempre que los mismos no afecten sustancialmente a las labores de la FAO. En este sentido, quiero aprovechar la oportunidad para ratificar el m\u00e1s decidido apoyo del Gobierno argentino al Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica del que somos beneficiarios. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n solicita expresamente que el Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica no se vea afectado en este proceso de ajustes que nos vemos obligados a efectuar. El PCT, lo reitero, tiene alta prioridad para mi Gobierno. Respecto al super\u00e1vit correspondiente al per\u00edodo 1984-85 co n un volumen superior a los 34 millones de d\u00f3lares, mi delegaci\u00f3n estima conveniente que se proceda a su distribuci\u00f3n conforme a las disposiciones reglamentarias vigentes. Creemos que adoptar una medida de excepci\u00f3n, como lo ha sugerido por lo menos una delegaci\u00f3n, crear\u00eda mayores dificultades de las que se tratan de evitar. Hemos escuchado al Dr. Shah y sabemos que adoptar una medida de excepci\u00f3n de esta naturaleza requiere la convocatoria de una conferencia extraordinaria, lo que de por s\u00ed implica gastos y, en el mejor de los casos, dicha conferencia extraordinaria s\u00f3lo podr\u00eda adoptar medidas que, en definitiva, tampoco incidir\u00edan excesivamente a resolver el problema del cash flow . -141- Mi Gobierno cree firmemente en los multilateralismo y en la funci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas cuyos principios ratificamos una vez m\u00e1s. La dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n financiera por la cual atraviesa mi pa\u00eds es bien conocida; dificultades que afect, nuestro comercio, a nuestra balanza de pagos y que se suman al pesado servicio de la deuda externa Todo esto limita seriamente nuestras posibilidades de crecimiento, pero, a pesar de ello, tratamos de cumplir con todos nuestros compromisos internacionales. En lo que va del a\u00f1o 1986 hemos podido abonar las cuotas pendientes hasta ese entonces y continuaremos en este camino a pesar del sacrificio que ello implica. Confiamos en que quienes m\u00e1s tienen tambi\u00e9n puedan cumplir con sus compromisos, los cuales tienen un doble car\u00e1cter: jur\u00eddico y moral LE faire sur la base de ce que le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Canada vient de nous dire (et je regrette qu'il ne soi pas l\u00e0). Il est plus pessimiste que moi car il dit que les Etats-Unis pourraient ne pas payer leu arri\u00e9r\u00e9s. If I know that this information is confirmed, I will certain ly propose an adjustment of much more than $16 million. If there is a statement by the United States that they will not pay their arrears, and do not consider them as arrears due legally, then in 1988/89 there will s till be $66 million unpaid by our major contributors, and we will have to consider the situation in a different manner. This is why I say the situation is fluid. We will consider the same important problem in December, and I w ill come back to you in June. Maybe in June we will propose something different. I am not optimistic, but if I have to be more pessimistic-and as Canada is very near to the US they may have a better appraisal of the situation-we shall start 1988 w ith about $96 million arrears. How will we function in 1988 when our Special Reserve Account is zero? If there is a difference in the dollar rate in 1988 in comparison with the exchange rate approved by the Conference in 1987, where would I find the differen ce? Now, under the FAO rules, I use the Special Reserve Account. The working Capital Fund will also be zero at the beginning of the year. $13 million plus $21 million in the Special Reserve Accoun t makes $34 million, and with the US contribution it would be ne arer $100 million. But I trust very much that the US Administration will do everything possible to make a supplementa ry allocation or whatever. I do not think they can tell us today that they will never pay this amount. Therefore I have to take the optimistic attitude that the US, in the case of FAO and other organizations, will eventually honour their obligations. They have never said that they will not pay, so I assume that they will pay. This is the option 1 have chosen. But the other option will certainly be very bad: and we will continue to follow the situation closely. The subject is going to be with us for some time. Mohd. Mazlan BIN JUSOH (Malaysia): On behalf of my like first of all to compliment Ambassador Bukhari and Mr Shah on their introduction to this agenda item. The matter of budgetary and financial shortfall is, indeed, a very serious problem faced by this Organization. As a member of the Finance Committee, we are fully aware of the magnitude of the problem and wo uld like to fully support the short-time measures and programme adjustments as proposed by the in publications and meetings, would inevitably hurt the work of this Organization, but under the present circumstances we would have to face the reality of the situation. On the Technical Cooperation Programme, we fully support the call made by many developing countries to maintain the level of allocations the last Conference. My delegation also wishes to join other delegations who have spoken before me to appeal to member countries who have yet to meet their obligations in full to do so as soon as possible as this would greatly alleviate this that nations, especially developing countries, are facing great financial difficulties of their own, but in the face of difficulties that FAO is having now this is the time to show solidarity with this Organization. In this respect, we would like also to urge member countries not to take unilateral decisions not to pay out in full, as this would create a very dangerous precedent in international organizations such as the FAO. On the alternative to borrow, my delegation feels that at this stage it may take such steps. well a is taken. This would enable us to fully appraise the gravity the and be able to consider its implications and prepare for its consequences. At this stage I wish to state that in view of our serious financial situation we are not in a position to agree any proposal that might entail any increased Nations. David Lawrence (Australia): Australia thanks the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his presentation of the reports of the 57th and 58th Sessions of that Committee. Australia was represented on the Committee by Mr. John Sault, and I can say we are in a position to endorse both reports. In relation to the budget and cash CL 90/23, Australia has always taken its financial obligations to the FAO very seriously. Its record of payment of contributions demonstrates that sincerity. We have taken note of the estimates by the Secretariat of the possible size of the shortfall. We are of the view that this is, unhappily, a realistic assessment on the basis of what is known at the present time and what the real position may turn out to be. However, given our understanding of the way events are moving in the United States, we do not see any reasonable likelihood that the bulk of those arrear s will be paid in th e 1988/89 biennium, if at all. However, we will be interested to hear the United States views on that point. If we are correct though it means that FAO is faced with a long-term shortfall in its income which as we have heard from the Director-General a little while ago, could be something like one hundred million dollars at the beginning of the 1988/89 biennium. In these circumstances, Australia is firmly committed to the position that it is not a cceptable to postpone the hard decisions that must be taken by FAO to adjust its expenditure to the level of resources that will be available over the next few years. While we recognize the need for the budget cuts proposed by the Director-General, we fear that they not adequate to address the situation and would result biennium an extremely precarious financial situation. Looking at the components of the 16. 4 million dollar savings proposed by the Director-General, I would like to see clarification in relation to the figure of 6. 5 million dollars, mentioned in connection with staff savings, as to whether that is a result of a freeze on recruitment for other than absolutely essential vacancies. My impression is that it is not. If it is not, then my delegation feels that such a policy could resolve the problem. They also observe a saving of 9. 9 million dollars in non-staff expenditures, against a total b udget of way to belittle efforts the Director-General has made. I understand are assuming that a substantial portion of the budget of the Organization would not yet be obligated against programme expenditure. In relation to the proposal to withdraw 9 million dollars from the Working Capital Fund we note that a withdrawal, as Canada according to Financial Regulation 6. 5, must be repaid in the 1988/89 biennium by Member States. presumably, assessment We If the difficult decisions are postponed until next year we feel that they will be all that much more difficult. Other major specialized agencies have already substantial expected shortfalls. We feel that FAO has no alternative but to face reality and take the same approach. We will make more specific comments on the alternative approaches proposed by the Director-General when that matter is under discussion. I should indicate that we are unable to accept proposals which shift the burden of shortfalls to other donors and seek to identify note changes which might be adopted in these procedures would to have any effect in the 1986/87 biennium, as no financia l surplus presumably will be available for distribution. It would not be until the ques tion of distribution for any cash surplus from the 1988/89 biennium comes up in January 1991, that there might be some real incentive in relation to encouraging earlier payments at least in regard to most of the alternatives put forward by the Finance Committee. Having said that, we would endorse the recommentation of Committee that they explore this matter focusing particularly on alternative 3 , 4 and 5. Just summing up, the objectives that Australia feels should be uppermost in the Council's mind in its consideration of this matter are, that the FAO must meet the projected shortfall in the 1986/87 biennium by much more Regular We do interest the very strong feelings of my delegation on that matter. Moreover, that FAO must not begin the 1988/89 in heavy debt. Also, that the financial burden of arrears is not transferred to members who have fulfilled their obligations. Our feelings would be that Council should ask the Director-General to go from this a set of proposals could be considered by the Finance Committee at the special session in D ecember. We do not accept that the Director- General does not have the authority to make much more substantial programme adjustments than proposed. To finish I would like to say, as Canada did, that I was pleased to hear the United Kingdom intervention earlier in this discussion. I found it to be very interesting and it demonstrated that a great deal of work had been put in by that delegation to analyse the budget situation. Out of that it would be question of what it actually costs FAO to deliver a dollar of programme. As I understand it, the UK delegation has calculated a figure of about 36 percent for the whole programme. Mr Shah in his response raised the difficulties that always arise when you try overheads to programmes. He assessed that the figure given by the UK might be better expressed as something like 13 percent (he said about one-third the UK figure). I have some misgivings about some of the allocations he was suggesting. I think this matter needs closer attention and all members of FAO should be concerned that as much money as possible goes to programmes rather than to maintaining and suggestion that this issue of programme delivery costs be the subject of a detailed study, possibly by outside experts, to come up with a formula that all can agree on. Lastly, in looking at the resources available to the Organization in dealing with this financial crisis, 1 have been a little puzzled by what the liquid funds represent. If you look at the b udget statements you will see that some 300 million dollars of liquid assets were in existence at the start of the biennium, (this was mentioned by the Danish Delegation) which are equivalent to 70 percent of the annual budget. We would be interested to know, like the Nordic countries, what these funds are used for, where they are held and why they cannot be run down to somewhat lower levels to assist in meeting the present financial crisis. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Nuestro distinguido colega y amigo el Embajador Bukhari, de Arabia Saudita, merece el pleno y sincero reconoc imiento de la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia por la inteligencia, competencia y la consagraci\u00f3n con que cumple sus santas funciones de Presidente del Comit\u00e9 do Finanzas. -144- El Sr. Shah hizo una excelente presentaci\u00f3n y luego en las respuestas que dio a trav\u00e9s del animado dialogo de esta ma\u00f1ana confirm\u00f3 la claridad y la forma documentada como pudo despejar dudas y ambig\u00fcedades que hab\u00edan sido planteadas. El Sr. Crowther hizo tambi\u00e9n una presentaci\u00f3n l\u00facida y completa. Empezaremos por decir que compartimos los aspectos sobresalientes-de la declaraci\u00f3n hecha esta ma\u00f1ana por nuestro colega Da Silva, del Brasil, sobre todo en cuanto a la necesidad de delinear claramente responsab ilidades, no confundir el proceso rutinario a trav\u00e9s del cual se hab\u00eda venido creando un d\u00e9ficit bienal promedio del 5 por ciento, sin que ello afectara la adecuada adecuaci\u00f3n del programa. Ahora el hecho bien conocido es otro. Esta circunstancia nos induce tambi\u00e9n a destacar c\u00f3mo los pa\u00edses en desarrollo hacen grandes esfuerzos, sacrifican inversiones vitales para su crecimiento econ\u00f3mico a fin de poder pagar sus contribuciones en divisas, que tanto escasean en nuestros pa\u00edses por la inmensa deuda externa, el proteccionismo y la falta de voluntad po l\u00edtica de algunos estados industrializados que no ofrecen asistencia t\u00e9cnica y financiera adecuadas. Brasil es un gran pa\u00eds en desarrollo cuya contribuci\u00f3n es superior a la de algunos estados industrializados, y por ello apoyamos la clara posici\u00f3n de nuestro colega brasile\u00f1o en el sentido de que ser\u00eda injusto involucrar por igual a todos los pa\u00edses en la determinaci\u00f3n de la crisis. Brasil, Camer\u00fan y M\u00e9xico, entre otros, reiteraron su apoyo al multilateralismo; la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia considera que en este momento dif\u00edcil es necesario consignar en nuestro informe la concepci\u00f3n di\u00e1fana e inmodificable de que el multilateralismo sigue siendo la base irremovible de la existencia de la FAO y de la propia cooperaci\u00f3n internacional. Otro aspecto importante que debe quedar muy claro es que ser\u00eda inaceptable que se prospectara siquiera la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima duda sobre la forma transparente, eficaz y din\u00e1mica como se cumple la excelente administraci\u00f3n de la FAO. Se ha hecho reiterada referencia a lo que sucede en otros Organismos del sistema de las Naciones Unidas; ya e 1 Director General dijo esta ma\u00f1ana que sigue con seriedad y toda atenci\u00f3n ese proceso, pero pensamos que no se puede generalizar, que ser\u00e1 necesario tener en cuenta los objetivos, los fines, los campos dentro de los cuales est\u00e1n enmarcadas cada una de esas Organizaciones. La FAO ocupa un lugar preponderante dentro de ese contexto por la alta significaci\u00f3n que la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n tienen para los pa\u00edses en desarrollo y por la grave crisis que afecta todav\u00eda a los pa\u00edses africanos y tambi\u00e9n a algunos otros pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo. Se ha criticado el hecho de que en Caja existan 300 millone s de d\u00f3lares. Nosotros pensamos que eso es signo de buena administraci\u00f3n, de prudencia y austeridad. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal si esta crisis se hubiera presentado sin que existiera un m\u00ednimo de disponibilidad l\u00edquida en las arcas de la FAO? Todo iba muy bien, no es culpa de la administraci\u00f3n si a la mitad del camino se le niega el combustible para seguir adelante. A la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia le ha llamado particularmente la atenci\u00f3n el hecho de que algunas delegaciones, pocas afortunadamente, hayan pedido que se apliquen reajustes justamente en los dos aspectos m\u00e1s positivos del programa de la FAO a partir de 1976, la descentralizaci\u00f3n y el Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica. Con los recortes propuestos por el Director General ya se afectan por reflejo las Oficinas Regionales y los representantes en los pa\u00edses, pero no podemos aceptar ninguna reducci\u00f3n ulterior que afecte la descentralizaci\u00f3n porque no queremos volver a la \u00e9poca ingrata, que yo viv\u00ed, superada ya afortunadamente, durante la cual actuaba en Roma la FAO como rueda suelta, aislada, encerrada en una torre de marfil, desvinculada de los problemas y de las necesidades que existen all\u00e1 en nuestros pa\u00edses, en las regiones en desarrollo. El Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica no podr\u00e1 tocarse; los gobiernos de los pa\u00edses beneficiarios diariamente realizan la evaluaci\u00f3n del PCT y son testigos directos de los beneficios de ese programa, adem\u00e1s de la evaluaci\u00f3n que ya se realiz\u00f3 con participaci\u00f3n de representantes de pa\u00edses desarrollados y con buen \u00e9xito, ampliamente reconocido. -145- Queremos dar acto al distinguido colega y amigo John Glistrup, de Dinamarca, quien habl\u00f3 en nombre de los altruistas y generosos pa\u00edses n\u00f3rdicos y tambi\u00e9n al delegado de Australia, quienes esta tarde han manifestado que son sensibles a la opini\u00f3n un\u00e1nime de ios pa\u00edses en desarrollo en favor del PCT. Nosotros pensamos que el PCT no es popular por demagogia, sino por la eficacia, por el efecto multiplicador que cumple en nuestros pa\u00edses, particularmente al estimular el mayor flujo de las inversiones. Se esgrimi\u00f3 aqu\u00ed el argumento de que el mayor contribuyente ad interim de la FAO hab\u00eda expresado reservas sobre el PCT. Nosotros creemos que esa referencia est\u00e1 fuera de orden porque afortunadamente nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n funciona en un marco multilateral dirigida al beneficio de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo; no existe aqu\u00ed, ni aceptaremos jam\u00e1s, la implantaci\u00f3n del voto ponderado; los programas y las pol\u00edticas de la Organizaci\u00f3n son decid\u00eddos por la Conferencia, en la cual participan todos los Estados Miembros sin ninguna diferencia. Los 45 millones del PCT arrastrados del bienio anterior corresponden a una disposici\u00f3n expresa de la Conferencia, y esto lo recuerdan muchos colegas, despu\u00e9s de negociaciones en las cuales prevaleci\u00f3 el inter\u00e9s de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Se ha dicho que el PCT deber\u00eda existir sobre la base de contribuciones voluntarias. \u00bfEs acaso otro intento de hacer ineficiente ese Programa someti\u00e9ndolo al dominio, a la discriminaci\u00f3n y a ios vetos de los grandes donantes y a los vaivenes y las incertidumbres de organismos como el FIDA y el PNUD, para citar s\u00f3lo dos casos? Si son sinceros quienes proponen cambiar el PCT a contribuciones voluntarias, pues bien, que hagan esas contribuciones voluntarias para sumarlas a los recursos que ya han sido asignados en el Programa Ordinario y fortalecer as\u00ed el PCT. Este Consejo debe ser consciente de. que el Programa 1986/87 fue aprobado por la Conferencia de 1985; debemos ser muy cuidadosos en relaci\u00f3n con la funci\u00f3n de este Organismo subalterno de la Conferencia. El Director General ha hecho propuestas que aceptamos con sacrificios. Ciertamente no estamos. complacidos porque vayamos a vulnerar la voluntad del m\u00e1ximo Organismo reduciendo el Programa aprobado; es f\u00e1cil decir para los representantes de los pa\u00edses desarrollados que no es suficiente lo que se propone, que se puedan hacer m\u00e1s reajustes, porque todo ello no les afecta, porque todo ello hace v\u00edctimas inocentes a los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo, pero nuestra actitud de comprensi\u00f3n tiene sus l\u00edmites, no podemos aceptar ninguna reducci\u00f3n m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los 16, 4 millones propuesta; ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1 ser\u00eda correr el riesgo no s\u00f3lo de incurrir en la ilegalidad, sino de comprometer seria e irreparablemente la ejecuci\u00f3n de un programa que ya en 1985 estuvo sometido al fu nesto crecimiento cero impuesto por los pa\u00edses desarrollados. Nosotros compartimos con el Director General la serenidad, la altura y responsabilidad dentro de las cuales se ha enmarcado este debate, porque ser\u00eda verdaderamente lamentable y triste que proliferaran intenciones y prop\u00f3sitos que no fueran sanos a la sombra de una situaci\u00f3n deplorable, de la cual no es responsable el Director Generai ni la gran mayor\u00eda de los estados miembros. Pensamos que la actitud com\u00fan debe ser positiva, un\u00e1nime, solidaria. Esta ma\u00f1ana nos doli\u00f3 oir hablar a la distinguida delega ci\u00f3n que inici\u00f3 el debate que esos 60, 90 \u00f3 100 millones no eran nada. Claro que esa cifra no es nada para los pa\u00edses desarrollados, pero es mucho para los pa\u00edses en desarrollo y estamos seguros de que los dem\u00e1s pa\u00edses industrial\u00edzedos as\u00ed lo entienden. Es inconcebible que se propicie la paralizaci\u00f3n de la organizaci\u00f3n diciendo que el Director General no debe recurrir a pr\u00e9stamos. El Consejo en 1981 y la Conferencia en 1983 aprobaron resolciones que autorizan al Director General a pedir pr\u00e9stamos. Por la prudencia que le caracteriza y el excelente criterio de administraci\u00f3n con que act\u00faa el Director General hasta ahora no ha hecho uso de esta autorizaci\u00f3n, pero si al comenzar 1988 o la situaci\u00f3n es la misma de hoy o peor el Director General deber\u00e1 recurrir a pr\u00e9stamos y tai vez convendr\u00e1 observar que este Consejo no puede derogar una resoluci\u00f3n de la Conferencia. El gobierno de Colombia ha reivindicado siempre la posici\u00f3n de respeto que deben ocupar los representantes de gobiernos en los organismos internacionales, pero cuando elegimos al jefe de una organizaci\u00f3n como \u00e9sta es porque merece nuestra confianza, por ello en los reajustes propuestos, que apoyamos, sabemos que el Director General ha procedido con el sano y acertado criterio que le distingue siempre. -146- Acogidos a la amplitud con que \u00e9l se ha referido a las reducciones propuestas, sin entrar en detalles, solo quisi\u00e9ramos declarar que en cuanto a las reuniones ojal\u00e1 se tenga en cuenta el caso particular de Am\u00e9rica Latina y El Caribe que padecen una tremenda deuda externa y que est\u00e1 afectada por el proteccionismo en su comercio, por lo cual dentro de lo posible ser\u00eda conveniente mantener aquellas reuniones que est\u00e9n dirigidas a impulsar la CPTD y la CPT para incrementar la producci\u00f3n y aumentar nuestras exportaciones. Nos hallamos ante una grave situaci\u00f3n lamentable, deplorable pero que es necesario afrontar con realismo. No podemos alegrarnos de que unilateralmente se hayan violado obligaciones contractuales, obligaciones contractuales adquiridas al adoptar la Conferencia el Programa de Labores y Presupuesto 1986/87; pero tampoco podemos en esta sala roja cambiar dos leyes de un pa\u00eds ni invertir el curso de las relaciones del cambio d\u00f3lar/lira. Por ello corresponde rodear solidarios al Director General para que nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n sufra lo menos posible en esta Crisis. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia se suma al llamado que debe ser firme y decidido de este Consejo al m\u00e1s alto contribuyente para que cumpla con su deber y honre el compromiso que adquiri\u00f3 con la Comunidad internacional. En nuestro informe deberemos tambi\u00e9n consignar la esperanza expresada esta ma\u00f1ana por nuestra colega y amiga la embajadora Fenwick, de los Estados Unidos, en el sentido de que este Consejo entiende que se trata de una situaci\u00f3n provisional, temporal y de que ese gran pa\u00eds pagar\u00e1 cuanto antes la totalidad de su contribuci\u00f3n para 1986/87, y de que esto no se repetir\u00e1 en los bienios futuros. Este Consejo debe tambi\u00e9n pedir al m\u00e1s alto contribuyente que adem\u00e1s de pagar la totalidad de su contribuci\u00f3n renuncie voluntariamente a recibir el reembolso que le corresponde por los excedentes de Caja en 1984/85. Lo mismo deber\u00edan hacer todos los dem\u00e1s estados miembros, renunciar voluntariamente a recibir los excedentes proporcionales que les corresponde y as\u00ed, sin conferencias especiales, se lograr\u00eda el buen prop\u00f3sito del colega y amigo embajador Pascarelli, de Italia. Se\u00f1or Presidente, hab\u00edamos solicitado intervenir entre los \u00faltimos en este debate porque esta ma\u00f1ana compartimos la inquietud del colega embajador Ariza Hidalgo, de Cuba. Creemos que en este debate ha hecho falta la declaraci\u00f3n del mas alto contribuyente al presupuesto de la FAO. Esperamos que \u00e9sta se produzca aunque sea a hora tard\u00eda en el curso del debate, porque confiamos sinceramente que esa declaraci\u00f3n va a disipar el pesimismo de nuestros colegas de Canad\u00e1 y de Australia y nos va a devolver la confianza en el respeto y la admiraci\u00f3n que merece esa gran naci\u00f3n. El Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas se reunir\u00e1 en diciembre; los Comit\u00e9s del Programa y de Finanzas tendr\u00e1n sus sesiones normales en la primavera de 1987 y luego en el Consejo de junio de 1987 revisaremos de nuevo la situaci\u00f3n. Eso es todo cuanto corresponde hacer a este Consejo por el momento. Lo dem\u00e1s ser\u00eda derrotismo inaceptable; no es constructivo ni aceptable que algunos distinguidos colegas, no quiero nombrar a sus pa\u00edses por respeto, pero colegas que est\u00e1n situados en esta misma fila hacia mi izquierda, que esos colegas, repetimos, se conviertan en casandras del desastre, que no se conviertan en pregorenos del apocalipsis, que no se conviertan en impulsores de la paloma que vuela con su pico hacia el infinito con 102 millones de d\u00f3lares, que no sean mensajeros desafortunados de consecuencias que m\u00e1s o menos veladamente podr\u00edan representar en cierta medida amenazas que no prosperar\u00e1n en el seno de esta Organizaci\u00f3n democr\u00e1ctica integrada por estados soberanos e independientes. LE PRESIDENT: Pour \u00e9clairer les membres du M. qui une pr\u00e9cision sur un take just a moment to clarify the issue that has been our financial statements as audited by the External Auditor and included in a document that will be discussed next week, C 85/5, in it there is reference to our cash balance as of 31 December 1985, the end of the last biennium, which was the end of the period the accounts were audited for. It shows a cash balance of approximate ly $300 million. Like any balance sheet you have to take into account both sides of the balance sheet. You cannot select one figure off the top and say it is available to be spent. It is certainly not surplus. The use of that $300 million has already been determined, as shown by the balance sheet. If you read down the liabilities si de you will see that there is not enough cash to support the entire list of liabilities that are there. I wish it were the case that we had so much cash that we could pay all our liabilities immediately. We have to depend on contributions which have not been r eceived as you w ill see from accounts payable-that is, we have incurred bills that we have literally not r eceived, there are purchases that have been made that are in transit and the fina l settlement has not been made -$29 million. Similarly we have other outstanding obligations of a long er term nature amounting to $45 million. We ha ve a portion of the roll-over of the TCP programmes that is recognised by the $300 million, but a very small portion unfortunately because we do not have sufficient cash to fund the TCP programme at the end of any particular year. To date of that $45 million in roll-over we show an obligation of over $20 million through October. At the end of D ecember we did not have sufficient cash to pay for the entire amount of the TCP programme. The next figure you see is the excess of income over expenditure, 34. 7. That is the very important 34. 7 of surplus that will be distributed on 1 January which was set aside in the accounts and is a liability recognised. Certainly that forms part of the cash. Next in Trust Funds, $114 million that we were holding at 31 D ecember to fund those projects operated under Trust Funds. Those were operating in conjunction with member governments and payments have been made and obligations of one nature or another have been incurred. But we cannot use that for any purpose other than those specific Trust Funds. No other use can be made of that money, it is held in trust. There are approximately $22 million in support costs which is the overhead that we r eceived from UNDP and others to pay for the FAO share of that amount. That presents a liability to the Organization because those amounts have been incurred within the Organization, and are due and payable. In addition, we have the Special Reserve Account. I believe it was mentioned in one of the interventions this morning that the $300 million did not include money for the working capital fund and the Special Reserve Account. Unfortunately it does. There are no extra funds to provide cash for those accounts. So you see listed the Special Reserve Account which at 31 December represented 5 percent of $21, 850, 000. The Working Capital Fund at that point was $13, 253, 975. If you take the entire amount in that column you see it adds to $388 million. The cash is roughly $300 million. Obviously there is not a sufficient amount of cash to cover that entire amount. It is always a bit dangerous to select the cash figure of major liquidity. The Organization has in effect two sources of revenue, contributors and other income. are received we invest them immediately, in fact the same day, at interest to attempt to draw as much interest as we possibly can. That source of revenue is certainly important and estimated in assessing contributions at the beginning of each biennium. Against those we have the Programme of Work and Budget. We cannot incur a deficit per se, that is not authorised. Therefore our cash inflow will never ex ceed our outflow. But, more important'ly, our cash outflow cannot exceed our inflow. We have to balance out. At the end of the year we zero out our entire operation. If there is any cash surplus whatsoever, as the Council well knows, it is then refunded in the following year. So you can look at all the accounts, at all the income and the expenditure, and if there is a surplus it will be refunded. At any one moment the amount of cash significantly paid, but in assessing that amount we must look at the liabilities that are owed at that point in time. -148- The audited accounts have always very clearly shown the entire picture both of the income and the expenditure, and the audited accounts this time, as has always been the case, showed that we have both r eceived the income accounted for and expended it in accordance with the rules of the Organization. Therefore I must conclude that we cannot measure the liquidity of the Organization by looking at the cash balance at the end of lasy year. As Mr Shah has indicated, the projections are that by the end of the biennium we will either be out of cash or very near out of cash. How we cover all the liabilities has been the purpose of the discussions here. Unfortunately that measure is very difficult to look Atif BUKHARI (Chairman, Finance Committee) (orignal language Arabic): I wanted to give you some very important information which has given rise to a good deal of discussion, but as Chairman of the Finance Committee I should like to draw the attention of my colleagues in the Council to the Report of the 58th Session of the Finance Committee, in particular to paragraphs 22-31. This concerns the delays in contributions, the measures which have been raised by delegates of Canada and Australia. I just wanted to say that these measures are not the solution to the financial crisis being experienced at the moment by the Organization but these are corrections to the distribution of the surplus liquidity starting from the years 1988/89. This is what we said in paragraph 26, about the eventual cash surplus for 1988/89. We say that during the 86/87 biennium there will not be any cash surplus. These are measures which we are proposing for detailed consideration so that these measures can be put into practice in the future. But these measures do not in any way refer to solutions for the present crisis being experienced by the Organization. Another point which I wanted to raise, the Finance Committee deals with this question and gives it a very considerable amount of time in its work. As the Council is the superior body it should give us some guidelines concerning the measures which we propose. Are we satisfied with the level which we have reached so far in the study of these measures or should we continue to study these measures and in particular the alternatives which were mentioned by the delegate of Australia? This is why I wanted to have the Council's view on that. It is not perhaps necessary to have the views of all members of the Council but if possible the Drafting Committee could indicate to us what the Council's attitude is on that specific point-that is, the measures to cope with the arrears in contributions. That is what I wanted to raise. PRESIDENT: d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 pour compl\u00e9ter ce qu'a dit M. Crowther. James D. AITKEN (United Knigdom): As we do seem to be conducting this meeting in a way in which there is a series of questions and answers perhaps I can take advantage of this to continue this process on the question of the Organization's liquidity. I am very grateful to Mr Crowther for his reply which one could say perhaps facetiously is in the nature of a bikini, it reveals a lot but also conceals some things as well, in a very interesting manner, I should add. First, I do not think anyone expects the Organization's cash assets to cover its liabilities. So while it is interesting to hear a comparison between cash assets and the liabilities it is perhaps not n ecessarily the most useful measure when one is looking at cash flow problems. A more useful measure in terms of find out the agency's actual cash outgoings over a period and comparing them with its liquidity the amount of money it holds in the bank and in cash. We find it very difficult to establish a figure for the actual money spent by FAO in any period, as distinct from the money committed or obligated. We have estimated that in a year FAO probably spends in the region of $460 million. On that basis if FAO spends $460 million the liquidity it has, the ratio of its spending to its assets, is somewhere in the region of 60 percent. We checked with another multinational organization, the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation. -149- You will have to forgive me because the figures we have are in pounds very small fund. Their liquidity (money they have in the bank) is one million pounds. There is a considerable difference between that, which we think is probably on the low side, and the money held by FAO. I think there is certainly something there that one could look at. More interestingly, and we are very grateful to Mr Crowther for making this point, it would be very useful to see a statement showing the monthly level of cash and liquid assets held by the Organization over the past biennium. would find this very useful in terms fluctuates from month to month. We would then have a better idea of the projections that we are being asked to consider. Dean K. (Assistant Dept. we do have an expenditure statement which is shown in the document I made reference to earlier. In fact, on the opposite page from the Balance Sheet, it shows the total amount of expenditure and the total amount of income. I think the Organization has been as transparent in listing those items in any great detail as it has every been requested to do. So if there are other additional needs we certainly can meet those. The expenditure statement has been audited. I think you can see the total amount of our expenditure is clearly set forth in the Statement of Income and Expenditure. A. Daniel WEYGANDT (Uni ted Sta tes of America): fter the long build-up to our statement I feel somehow that I am destined to disappoint, but we will do our best. I should also like to keep my remarks as brief as possible in view of the late hour, and in view of the fact that the time of the Council is worth something itself. I should like to begin by thanking Dr Bukhari for his introduction and both Mr Crowther and Mr Shah for their information; and also the Director-General for his should preface referring to what he has just mentioned namely the answer to the two questions-yes, it is true that the United States has not renounced its obligations, but no, we cannot say what our situation is going to be with respect to 1988 or 1989. In fact, we cannot say what our situation is going to be with respect to 1986, and we clearly do not know what the situation is going to be with respect to 1987. I cannot comment on whether other delegates have been overly overly pessimistic about what our United States Congress will decide to do with respect to its contribution level. I would, however, remind delegates that this is an extremely complicated issue and is not just with respect to FAO, by any means whatsoever, and it is not just with respect to the Specialized Agencies of the UN system. It is a matter of policy towards the UN system as a whole and is intricately involved with the whole budgetary situation within the United States itself. The United States delegation regrets that we are not able to provide more information and we hope to be able to do so as soon as we can. The United States delegation has listened with great interest and attention to the interventions of previous speakers and we will be sure to convey the spirit of these statements to the Government and to the Congress. As has been pointed out, the shortfall in the US contribution is the result of Congressional action affecting the whole of the UN system. It is not directed at FAO alone. It has been encouraging to hear that most speakers take this financial crisis seriously. With respect to the United States contribution, the most effective action (perhaps unfortunately) that any Member of the Council could take at this time would be to urge its Govern ment to support the reforms proposed for the United Nations in New York by the High Level Group of Eighteen which is looking at UN issues of reform and budgetary progress. This is because, for better or worse, the concerns of the United States Congress centre on the UN rather than the Specialized Agencies. -150- As I said, we are not in a position to say at this time what our contribution is going to be either for the present period or for next year's period, either with respect to level or timing. However, I must say in candour that the outlook for next year is not much different than the outlook for the present year. I cannot dispute the estimates that the Organization has made with respect to the US $64 million shortfall for this present biennium, nor can I confirm them. However, it may be reasonable to believe that this is of the rough order of magnitude that can be expected. With respect to the Director-General's proposals in document CL 90/23, let me just address one point on them, that is, that the United States believe it would be harmful to the Organization in the long term to resort to external borrowing. I should like to refer briefly to a point made by the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Dr Bukhari, with respect to proposals for the Finance Committee report. My delegation would like associate itself with previous delegate-I believe it was Brazil-who indicated that this is not a solution in itself. My delegation feels that this is not perhaps the best time to consider such measures. It may be advisable to take into account the experience of other organizations. The United States does not take the present situation lightly. Whilst it is true that some 40 percent of the membership has not paid any part of its contributions, the United States does not relish becoming a member of this relatively large group. We look forward to working with the Secretariat and all other members of the Organization in trying to resolve the present difficulties. We welcome the decision to have a special session of the Finance Committee in D ecember and we are op timistic that by that time the level of the 1986 United States contribu tion will be clear. However, it is regrettable that there will be no representative of North America at that meeting. The present crisis should provide an occasion to reflect on the benefits all members derive from FAO. The shortfall in the United States contribution is not a complete surprise. For some years United States delegations to various UN organizations have been urging the need of agencies' activities on priority delegation can only hope that with proper seriousness on the part of all members, FAO and the UN system will emerge from the current crisis stronger and better able to meet the needs of the international community. Nous passer la Chine. Li ZHENHUAN (China) language Chinese): Some of the delegations have just elaborated on the current budgetary and financial uncertainties. The Chinese delegation would like to join other delegations in discussing the issue and state our view. Over the years most of the Member Nations have earnestly fulfilled their financial commitment, providing FAO with a solid foundation for its budget and finance. The management of the Secretariat is also efficient. Here I should like to cite two figures from the Director-General's opening speech. The FAO expenditure for personnel has been cut down from 77 percent of the budget in 1975 to the present 55 percent. During the same period the expenditure for administration has decreased from 24 percent to 16 percent, while the proportion of technical and economic programmes in the Programme of Work has increased, which ensured the success for the -151- implementation of the FAO Programme of Work, and contributed to the food production and agricultural development throughout the world. Nevertheless, starting from the current biennium, uncertainties have been hovering over the FAO's budget and general financial status. Apart from world economic and monetary factors, the failure of some Member Nations, one of the However, since the restoration of the legitimate Membersh ip in FAO of Chin a in 1973, Chin a has faithfully carried out its financial duties. Therefore, the Chinese delegation hopes that the Director-General will once again appeal to countries who have not yet fulfilled their financial obligations to pay their delayed contributions for the current-assessments and arrears so as to ensure the implementation of the current biennium Programme of Work and Budget approved by the 23rd Session of the FAO Conference.

Point of order Point d'ordre Punto de orden Octavio Rainho da SILVA NEVES (Brazil): Following your ruling yesterday we just addressed ourselves in a very brief manner to the Report of the Finance Committee to some extent and to 12. 1 (a). We did not address ourselves to 12. 1 (b), so following your ruling we understand that we are free to ask for the floor to address ourselves to that point. LE PRESIDENT: Pour esp\u00e9rons finir ce matin, discussion sur trois documents que examinons nous aurons termin\u00e9, le document une sur les mesures \u00e0 que souhaite le Pr\u00e9sident du de poursuivre ses travaux, 17 d\u00e9cembre, tenant des vues des membres du Finance Arabic): I think the Chairman has entirely cleared up everything that I tried to indicate yesterday. The fact of the matter is that I do not wish to repeat this and I certainly do not want to ask for the floor specifically to go over the same ground. This is a matter which will have important repercussions in time. What you have before you is a series of alternatives which we in the Finance Committee thought might be useful for the future work of the Committee and yesterday I said I wished them to be considered. In fact, the Drafting Committee itself-this might be the best solution to avoid a second debate on this second section- could orientate the discussion along those lines. In any case, the members of the Council have the final word on this matter. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): Some of our speakers yesterday spoke before we had had this very strong plea from the Chairman of the Finance Committee to focus on the proposals in paragraphs 22 to 31 of document CL 90/17, so we did not actually cover this. Of course, we could come back again and cover this, but I wonder whether it would simplify matters if our observations on this point, which are probably short, could be included in statements on the Alternative Approaches to dealing with Budgetary and Financial Uncertainties in document CL 90/24 under (b). Then it is only a question of the Secretariat being alert and putting them under the right Agenda item and feeding them in to the Chairman of the Committee and the Drafting Committee. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): Muy brevemente. S\u00f3lo para aclarar que como Presidente del Comit\u00e9de Redacci\u00f3n estimo que ser\u00eda un tanto inconveniente, inclusive dif\u00edcil, que se llevara el tipo de auscultaciones o de negociaciones que recomienda el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas en el seno del mismo. En \u00faltima instancia, si fuera n ecesario y en el caso de que no tuviera usted Sr. Presidente y por tanto tampoco el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas una idea clara de lo que piensan sus miembros, que se constituya un miembro de contacto o un grupo de apoyo espec\u00edfico, pero solamente si usted no tiene tal consenso. Pero s\u00ed quiero dejar a un lado los trabajos de redacci\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n; \u00e9ste solamente deber\u00eda encargarse de tal cosa . Yo repito, muy atentamente, que por favor se cumpla con tal prop\u00f3sito. -156- Octavio Rainho da SILVA NEVES (Brazil): In connection with this question of the Report of the Finance Committee I share the views of the representative of Mexico. We do not think that the Drafting Committee is a negotiating committee so we would not be prepared to give this power to the Drafting Committee. On the other hand, as far as the Report of the Finance Committee is concerned yesterday we expressed formally our reservations suggestions contained therein. So unless you allow us to come back to this point eventually, Mr Chairman, we sould like to stress once again our reservation in connection with paragraph 31 in the context of the observations we made yesterday. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos compartir el criterio que han presentado los distinguidos representantes de M\u00e9xico y de Brasil referente a la funci\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y al p\u00e1rrafo 31. Adem\u00e1s, Sr. Presidente, queremos expresarle que tenemos la palabra solicitada desde ayer porque considero que no podemos desviar la discusi\u00f3n ni cortar la discusi\u00f3n en el momento preciso en que acabamos de conocer realmente que cambian todas las condiciones aqu\u00ed para la discusi\u00f3n del futuro financiero de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Por tanto, yo no me podr\u00e9 ajustar espec\u00edficamente a lo que usted plantea y voy a intervenir espec\u00edficamente sobre lo que le anunci\u00e9 en mi primera intervenci\u00f3n, mis reservas a discutir y analizar la situaci\u00f3n del primer contribuyente. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): I did want to draw attention to this particular matter which has been brought to us by the Chairman of the Finance Committee. I did note in the interventions yesterday that too few speakers addressed this particular issue, I think because it is of very much less importance than the major crisis which is facing us and most speakers wanted to move along to the short-term measures that might address our financial crisis. The second element is the fact that I do feel we have a mixture of issues here. This is being discussed in the same item as short-term measures to address the financial crisis. This particular measure designed to deal with the problems of delayed contributions is not only of a different order but is a different topic altogether. It is something that has been discussed for three or four years. It is something that if a decision is taken it will not be in effect for three or four years and, in light of the prospects for surplus, may not be in effect for the next eight or ten years. It is a small thing financially relative to the issues that drew the attention of speakers yesterday. If I were to judge whether it is a short-term or a longer-term measure, I would say that it is more of a longer-term measure, and perhaps, with your indulgence, Mr Chairman, when we get to point (b) speakers might be encouraged also to address this particular item a long-term measure so that we could give guidance to the Finance Committee. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Los debates sobre proced imiento suelen ser \u00fatiles porque rompen un poco la monoton\u00eda de la serie de declaraciones, sin embargo, creemos que ya hay elementos suficientes para que se prosiga nuestro debate y las delegaciones que quieran hacerlo podr\u00e1n referirse al informe del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas cuando se discuta el documento CL 90/24 como lo han sugerido el Reino Unido y Canad\u00e1, o en cualquier otro momento. Este es un debate amplio, hay una interrelaci\u00f3n indiscutible entre todos los aspectos financieros; luego, como es de costumbre, la Secretar\u00eda preparar\u00e1 un texto del primer proyecto del informe, lo pasar\u00e1 al Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n en el cual est\u00e1n representadas todas las regiones y todas las tendencias y luego veremos qu\u00e9 se le presenta al pleno del Consejo el proyecto de informe. Creo que esto es lo que hay que hacer y proseguir nuestros trabajos. LE PRESIDENT: Je pense que nous allons first sight, as intricate. The letter from the distinguished Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the FAO of the 17th November to Mr Shah, whilst adding to the bulk of the documents and without if I may say so simplifying the Information and data, raises a number of questione based on certain assumptions of a financial and accounting nature. As we know, Mr Shah has questioned the assumptions of the distinguished UK delegation and also the conclusions. That apart, how I wish this letter of the United Kingdom delegation had been made available to us in our capital, New Delhi, so that I too could have had -157- this examined by competent financial experts without relying exclusively on whatever inhouse talent could be commandeered by us in Rome in the last two days. Despite these complications, thanks to the lucid expositions given Chairman of the Finance Committee, His Excellency Bukhari, the position has become result, the issues for decision before us with equivocation. The brief interventions made by the Deputy Director-General, and Assistant Director-General, Mr clarified the position further. May I specially compliment Mr Shah for the information he has furnished, and the incisive analysis he has presented, in throwing light and thereby enhancing further the transparency data in relation to the issues specifically raised by some of the distinguished delegates. Overhanging our discussions in the Council during this session , is the issue of financial uncertainty arising out of a policy change which has recently become effective in one of the member countries FAO. The fact that this member also happens to be the single largest contributor to the FAO imparts a special seriousness to the emerging situation. All of us do understand the imperatives which come into play in the decision-making processes of elected to on observed that \"domestic policy has its own demands\". However much we in FAO Council might wish that we did not have to contend with these reductions and uncertainties, we have to recognize the realities and consider at this stage what changes are n ecessary, in the short term, in the FAO budget and programmes. It is clear, as was stated by the distinguished delegate from the USA yesterday, that the uncertainties and reductions in relation to US contributions are not confined to the FAO alone, but are applicable to the entire UN System across the board. India believes that this is contrary to the principles of sovereign equality and Speaking of timely remittances, I find that my country figures in the list of countries from whom contributions are outstanding. May I mention, in that this remittance has cleared Hopefully, should be the FAO this meeting of the Council concludes on the 28th. May I also briefly draw Mr Shah's attention to page 4 of document CL 90/4 and enquire whether in the footnote (a) for Appendix A, we should read Appendix B. Permit me to refer briefly to the intervention made by the distinguished delegate of the United Kingdom yesterday, about the programme delivery costs of the FAO. With the nodding aquaintance I acquired in a British university, where I had the opportunity of studying financial management and based on what little experience I subsequently had in management in government in India, which is also a developing country, I tried to understand the points made in the United Kingdoms delegate's letter based on the analysis of Mr Aitken and the ODA. In the British analysis a number of assumptions have been made. For example, the TCP programme delivery costs have been shown as \"nil\" in the itemized analysis on page 4 of the document. Similarly, in arriving at the programme delivery costs of Extra Budgetary items, certain assumptions have made the imputed costs. The summary of estimates by programme, which is page 11 of the document, (although I find that all the pages are not serial numbered) would show that while budgetary funds are estimated at 68 million US dollars, the extra-budgetary funds are estimated at 467. 846 million funds is in nutrition, food and agriculture, information and analysis and programme management. In presenting the allocation of costs by the ODA by the UK, would it be incorrect to assume that some To quote an example, whilst I am in Rome for the Council meeting, for attending which, I understand, the FAO pays me the fare, if I also attended to some of the \"programme delivery\" work of government, I would submit that delivery government for that programme would be relatively very low. On the other hand, if my government chooses to send me here exclusively for the alone, I would the costs of be much higher. I am, however, obliged to the distinguished delegate from the United Kingdom for the table extracted on the last page of his document which gives the region wise summary. This statement, according to me, appear to be significant also possibly explains of the stances being taken by the various Member Nations in this Council meeting. Whilst on the subject, permit me to make a point. which is somewhat related. The British delegation has made certain cost comparisons in programme delivery costs with the I respectfully submit that whilst cross be valid, we must make them with caution and some circumspection. The comparisons really depend on the nature of activity in which that Organization is engaged, the nature of the projects which it is dealing with and, what is most important, the scale of the projects. I would submit, if I am dealing with the World Bank or the IMF, which is dealing with banking operations, the criteria would be different. If I am dealing with the International Finance Corporation which funds large industrial projects, the criteria for programme delivery costs would be different. If I am dealing with large irrigation projects which involve massive investments once details and programmes and plans and designs are finalized, or with hydro or thermal powered projects the criteria will again be different. I would also submit that if I am dealing with the World Bank to borrow 200 million dollars for a single project in India, in agricultural extension or in irrigation, I would contend that the project programme delivery costs would be low. On the other hand, with a budget of only 61 million dollars for TCP spread over about one hundred countries programme Therefore, I would submit that in agricultural programmes, field delivery costs and programme costs might not be always very easy to make, or valid. We in the Government of India, whilst dealing with our own agricultural development programmes, come face to face with this problem rather frequently, when we interact with own financial experts. As all the distinguished delegates are aware, the contributions to agricultural development by the State (that is the Government) is mostly in terms of (a) extension staff and (b) laying of demonstrations. All inputs, and I emphasise all, and investments which contribute largely to agricultural development are paid for by the farmer himself, either from his own or loaned funds. Often, Committee tells us that our programme delivery costs are very high, ranging up to over 90 percent in some cases. Such high programme delivery costs are more than balanced by benefits which the farmer reaps in of increased agricultural production and income through technical advice and services. I do not know to what extent this analogy would be applicable at \"country level\" FAO programmes. May I suggest that this aspect could be gone into when the distinguished delegate from the United Kingdom and Mr Shah meet again to discuss these issues. I would once again reiterate that we must exercise caution in making cross comparisons. As Mr examples illustration, with such telling effect yesterday, the figures arrived at by the distinguished delegate from the United Kingdom would seem to suffer from lacuna in activities of certain devisions and posts the FAO and the Regional I would submit that these issues which involve questions of exhibition in the statements of accounts are so specialized, complex and complicated that they should be tackled not by us, the generalists in this Council, but by specialists in finance, accounts and 0 & M. In our view the question raised is really a \"question of fact\" and does not involve any \"value judgement\". As with all \"questions of fact\" this matter could and would have only one right answer. As Mr Shah has explained, the United Kingdom analysis has placed the programme development costs at 300 percent of the figure arrived at by Mr Shah himself. I do hope that the delegate from the United Kingdom will avail himself of the offer made by Mr Shah and be able to sit down with him so that at the specialist and professional level there can be unanimity about the classification of the activities and costs in computing the programme delivery costs. The letter from the delegate of the United Kingdom, paragraph 15 , ends by emphasizing the need for detailed information to be given to the Member States. As all of us know just as \"programmes delivery delivery costs\". This point has been made by the Chairman of the Finance Committee, as also by the Director-General himself, that consistent with cost-effectiveness, there will be no hesitation on the part of the FAO headquarters to provide all the information. Those of us who are working in parliamentry democracies and who are called upon to furnish information answering parliamentary questions do not require any further proof about the costs of information gathering and delivery. Another aspect which I would like to refer to is the slow pace at which agricultural activities tend to move in developing countries. In this setting are dealing with segments of society which are tradition bound and yet are willing to change provided the benefits of modern agricultural practices are demonstrated to them. The process of change is slow and often painfully slow. I am mentioning this in the context of observations made by the delegate of Japan who, while talking of the TCP, referred to the large roll-on or carry-over funds of the order of about 47. 7 million dollars by the end of March 1986 and went on to suggest that perhaps for this reason the TCP could make do with some cuts. As far as I understand from the budgetary documents-Mr Bukhari is a better authority on this, chairing, as he does, the Finance Committee-in the FAO we go by the concept of an appropriation for -159- the biennium, which is followed by the identification of the programmes and once the identification is completed, comes the third stage of of allocations with the approved programmes. Based on this and the pace of expenditure over the period of 24 months, over a period of time, we agree with the suggestion by the delegate from Japan. On the contrary the comfortable cash position of the FAO to which references were made by some delegates is, I would imagine, a direct follow-up of the budgetary procedures and the funding methodology followed by the FAO. Some of the members have referred to an evaluation of the working of the TCP. I find from the report of the 57th Session of the Finance Committee, document 90/4 on page 2, paragraph 5, there is a reference to evaluation of Technical Cooperation Programme and the organization of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Programme for Africa. What is more satisfying is that this particular evaluation has been funded from savings that have accrued from some of the on-going programmes. Another reference which we have heard throughout the discussion in this Council has been about the efficiency, effectiveness, responsiveness and image of the FAO, I would contend the TCP as conceived and implemented is a programme which has enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of the FAO, which has revved up the responsiveness of the FAO and which, if anything, has improved the image of FAO. On top of this, the United Kingdom document, if I am permitted to quote from that, notes that the TCP has apparently the lowest programme delivery costs. TCP in my view has been of immense and direct relevance to the of the funds for TCP. On the other hand we would request the Director- General to find a way of maintaining the annual growth rate in the allocations for the TCP. Before I turn to the financial aspect I would like to mention a couple of aspects of the World Food Programme in document CL 90/17. I would particularly refer to paragraphs 64, 65 and 66. It is somewhat odd that an organization should find itself in a situation where it enters into a contract for the sum of 3 million from which it was not able to get much of a benefit. It is also somewhat surprising that at the end the Organization finds it \"advisable to use its available financial and staff resources to develop and implement a viable alternative computer strategy rather than pursue complex and uncertain litigation\". This I would submit is an area which it involves millions of dollars, at least 3 million in this case. The second item is that in paragraph 65 there is a reference to an Asian country, which I presume is not India. However I do hope that the explanation furnished by the Committee to the External Auditor has been satisfying and there will be no modification of the assistance that India has been getting from the World Food Programme considering the important role that this programme has been playing in India. Lastly, I will deal with some of the financial aspects. When a crunch of this nature comes for any organization, cuts become inevitable. What to cut and by how much are difficult and often painful decisions. In imposing cuts we are all aware that there cannot be any soft options. Before I react to the propositions contained in the docu ment, may I venture to sugge st that all the programmes included in the schedule of the FAO for the biennium 1986-87 deserve to be so included and implemented and would indeed have been implemented had there been no unilateral decision by the single largest contributor. Against this background we realize that in these programmes which are considered to be important and vital, due to the resource crunch, we have to make certain cuts. If we try to go through the list item by item and try to decide which item has to be cut and by how much, we would be hard put to decide where and by how much to put the axe. I would therefore submit that the proposals contained in the document which have been tabled indicating the type of activities that are to be cut must be a ccepted by the Council. As regards the ways and means figures, the Director-General has emphasized in the course of the document which is placed before us, (I am referring to the document CL 90/23) that he is committed to maintain the continuing financial and budgetary solidarity of the Organization beyond the perspective of this biennium. He also goes on to say that the situation is fluid, as we all know and requires constant monitoring, and the Director-General has assured us he this situation close attention. I would suggest that the situation is dynamic and changing we should adopt all the suggestions that have been made in the documentation of this Conference about the reductions to be made in the funding of programmes of this biennium. LE PRESIDENT: WINKEL Federal Republic of): Let me first express our gratefulness to the Secretariat for having presented these numerous documents My largely agrees with the analytical part of these documents. We are here to discuss possible solutions to further Finance Committee. We welcome the fact that the Director-General has examined the financial situation and informed us about the results of his considerations. In this respect we have come to the following conclusions ourselves. We share reflected in paragraph 35 of the document CL 90/23 to implement the Programme of Work and Budget for 1986-87 only to the maximum extent possible. This means to us that the Organization has to restrict itself under the present circumstances to an extent which is not yet exactly measurable the We also share expressed in 90/23 that the situation requires constant monitoring. We welcome the Director-General's proposal for saving s of US$16. 4 million as para graph 30 of document CL 90/23 reflects. In this respect we share the Finance Committee's view that the fina ncial the Orga nization in th e biennium and assumed in document CL 90/23, depends upon whether and to what extent the evolve in reality. We also share the Director-General's view that in the case of shortfalls in the budget to the amount of about US$ 90 million small economies will not be sufficient. The conclusion we draw therefrom is that adjustments of expenditures to receipts w ill be n ecessary to an even greater extent than so far is reflected in paragraphs 27 to 31 of document CL 90/23. This may lead us to programme adjustments which go beyond the scope suggested by the Director-General in Appendix A to document CL 90/23. In addition to the adjustment of expenditure to the r eceipts available, which seems absolutely necessary to us, we believe that shifts in the budget itself could also make a contribution to solving a possible financial crisis in our Organization. In this regard we see for example chances for shifts from the TCP to other items of higher priority. It was pointed out that the Conference could only amend the Programme of Work and Budget 1986-87. We feel that this is not the problem. In our opinion the Programme of Work to effect the expenditure approved by the Conference. We do not, however, believe that the approval of the Programme of Work and Budget by the Conference also implies at the same time a commitment to spend the appropriations. Therefore we share the opinion of Mr Shah that there is no use in convening a special Conference session of FAO, especially since the Finance Committee will have one special and two normal meetings and the Council will meet twice again before the next FAO Conference. We consider the balancing between lower income and expenditure through programme adjustment a procedure which is in line with the Constitution. Its application can ensure the functioning and working capacity of the Organization without requiring an amendment to the Basic Texts of the Organization. For the future, however, we should examine in greater detail the different alternatives deal with delayed payment of assessed contributions, as spelled out in Appendices C and D of document CL 90/17. In particular alternatives III, IV and V in Appendix D of this document seem justifiable to us. This is a crisis of the United Nations system as a whole. Therefore in our opinion in the short-term the United Nations Secretary General and the heads of the various specific proposals shortfall their and these bridged by recourse to supplementary assessments, the use of Working Capital Funds or loans. As we learnt yesterday from Mr Shah, other organizations have already followed this line. My Government deplores the critical situation to which our Organization has come, which is of great concern to all of us. We hope however that this will be a short-term problem only. Meanwhile should to overcome this problem. We should all together use the time to define our own role as members of the Organisation, to define the aims we have and to examine whether we consider our Organization sufficiently well-equipped to meet the demands of the future. It is of no use arguing about opposite opinions. Let us instead in the time to come make additional efforts to keep FAO on top of its vocation as the leading global forum for agricultural policy. Abdel Azira EL-GAZZAR (Egypt) (original language Arabic): I would like at the outset to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Dr At if Bukhari and for briefly to express its full support for the proposals made by the Director-General of FAO to overcome the Organization's financial difficulties, which we all hope will be of a temporary nature. we particularly support the Director-General's proposal to generate the n ecessary internal funding by drawing on the Organisation's safety net, at it were, or through external borrowing if need be. we are also fully convinced of the efficiency of the financial management of this Organization and are also keen on not jeopardising technical programmes approved by the General Conference in its last session. Such funds should not be touched except within the narrowest limits. We should like also to refer here to our full support to maintain the current levels of allocations for the role assumed Programme in accelerating agricultural respective countries. A. K. M. Kamaluddin CHOUDHURY (Bangladesh): Against the backdrop of the financial crisis that FAO is facing, ve express our thanks to the Director-General for presenting the issues in a comprehensive and realistic manner. we would also like to thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his excellent presentation of the report and Mr Shah for his useful clarification. We fully share the concern of the Director-Genral about the budgetary and financial uncertainties which the Organization is facing and ve endorse the measures proposed by the improve the situation. The proposals for programme adjustment and drawing on the working Capital Fund as well as the alternative approaches made in document CL 90/24 will, we believe, will improve the budge tary financial situation and at the same time they will help to generate savings to ensure the implementation of the Programme of Work of the Organization. We are somewhat concerned about the Technical Cooperation Programme, which the most important means for translating FAO programmes into action. Bangladesh, like many other developing finds would the the of the Programme and would However, if can be arranged in a more efficient manner, we will have no objection in the matter. We appreciate that certain activities need to be curtailed in the present biennium to tide over the present financial crisis. While proposing the programme adjustment for the remainder of the biennium it was stated in paragraph 30 in document CL 90/23 that there will be no cancellation of any statutory requirement, such as obligatory meetings of an intergovernmental body. In this connection we would like to draw your attention to document CL 90/23, where we notice that a proposal has been made to cancel the meeting of the IGG on Jute-that is the Intergovernmental Jute, Kenaf and Allied Plbres--as an economy measure. As far as my knowledge goes, there are a number of other intergovernmental groups, but none of them seems to have been affected by this economy measure. Therefore we feel that while we appreciate the need for some economy measures we do not understand isolatlng only the IGG on Jute, Kenaf ve not be curtailed. I would like to inform you that the Government of Bangladesh has always given special importance to the activities of this Group. Jute plays s very importent role in the economy of Bangladesh and it accounts for 60 percent of its foreign exchange earnings, and the delegation of Bangladesh would be happy to see that the meetings of the Intergovernmental Group on Jute, Kenaf and Allied Fibres take place as usual. Ve think if some deferment has to be made it can be done but perhaps these activities should mot be disturbed. Ve suggest th activities of the IGG on should continue and the proposed cut on the meetings the IGG on Jute should be reconsidered. We propose that this item should be deleted from the list of programmes which have been cut. Guillermo G. GUERRERO HER NANDEZ (Ecuador): Quiero sumarme primero a las felictaciones y agradecimientos formulados equi por la presentaci\u00f3n de los documentos sobre el tema que nos ocupa. Mi delegaci\u00f3n no ha hecho uso de ls palabra a fin de no repetir conceptos enunciados por otras delegaciones; sin embargo no quisiera que su silencio pueda interpretarse como desinter\u00e9s por parte del Ecuador ante el an\u00e1lisis de un problema tan serio como es la crisis financiera que enfrenta la -162- Organizaci\u00f3n, Por tanto, me veo en el caso de insistir en lo ya expresado, en el sentido de que la crisis se debe a factores ajenos al funcionamiento y manejo de la FAO y que las medidas propuestas para combatirla por parte del Director General merecen el apoyo total de mi pa\u00eds. Adicionalmente, algunas delegaciones han propuesto recortes en el Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica; inclusive, si he entendido bien, se ha insunuado que solamente ser\u00edan prioritarios y urgentes un 20 6 25 por ciento de las actividades del PCT, porque quer\u00eda recortarse alrededor de un 75 u 80 por ciento. Sobre el tema, se\u00f1or Presidente, mi delegaci\u00f3n se opone enf\u00e1ticamente a recortar el PCT ya que este Programa constituye si no la naturaleza misma de la FAO o su raz\u00f3n de ser, por decirlo as\u00ed, por lo menos el medio m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctico de acci\u00f3n para combatir el hambre y la desnutrici\u00f3n que azotan a gran parte de la humanidad. Finalmente, a nombre de mi pa\u00eds formulo un llamado para que quien unilateralmente ha disminuido su contribuci\u00f3n a la FAO busque y encuentre la f\u00f3rmula que pueda dejar sin efecto esa decisi\u00f3n, sobre todo considerando que el monto de tal contribuci\u00f3n resulta de un compromiso responsablemente asumido por ese pa\u00eds en el marco multilateral de esta Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional y en base de la cual se ha elaborado el plan de acci\u00f3n y a aprobado de la FAO para el actual bienio. Bava SAHADOU (Niger): Le point 21 l'ordre jour de cette session. A la lecture des documents qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis, et expos\u00e9s fournis. m\u00eame ou plus que jamais nos pays en ont le plus besoin. A cet notre internes que Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la FAO nous a livr\u00e9s hier soir, et en particulier de ses propositions nous le Nous de mauvais paiement des contributions est, en principale financier qui risque d'affecter notre Organisation. Etant donn\u00e9 que humoristique. une laiti\u00e8re et donc nourrici\u00e8re, nous nous devons nous maintenant de m\u00e9diter en son \u00e2me et conscience sur ce paradoxe. Pour ce qui nous concerne, nous n'avons d'autre plaidoyer et nous croyons encore \u00e0 la noblesse de mission qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e: combattre la faim et la malnutrition dans le monde. sans consid\u00e9ration de r\u00e9gion, de couleur, de race ni de religion. -163- Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n desea ahora abordar espec\u00edficamente el tema de la situaci\u00f3n financieraQde la FAO. Somos conscientes de que el an\u00e1lisis hecho por el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas en su 57 y 58 per\u00edodo de sesiones en mayo y septiembre pasados, respectivamente, ha variado a partir de la informaci\u00f3n contenida en el documento 90/23, parte 2 \"novedades recientes, perspectivas actuales y propuestas del Director General\"\u00b7 Sin embargo, deseo referirme brevemente a algunos de loe p\u00e1rrafos de los documentos 4 y 17 introducidos por el embajador Bukhari, de Arabia Saudita, antes de entrar a comentar el documento 90/23. En el p\u00e1rrafo 20 del documento 90/4 se dice que \"se inform\u00f3 al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas de que la legislaci\u00f3n promulgada en 1985 por el gobierno del mayor pa\u00eds contribuyente afectar\u00eda considerablemente a sus cuotas de pago al sistema de Naciones Unidas, incluyendo a la FAO\". En el p\u00e1rrafo 23 el Comit\u00e9 expres\u00f3 profunda preocupaci\u00f3n por esta situici\u00f3n y subray\u00f3 que el pago integro de las cuotas asignadas de contribuci\u00f3n constitu\u00eda una obligaci\u00f3n de los estados miembros, para despu\u00e9s manifestar en el p\u00e1rrafo 24 que no se deb\u00eda pedir a los estados miembros que compensaran el d\u00e9ficit ocasionado por la reducci\u00f3n de pagos de cualquier pa\u00eds contribuyente. Lo que el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas no sabia en mayo pasado era la magnitud de la retenci\u00f3n del pago del mayor contribuyente para el bienio 1986/87. Por otro lado, en el documento 90/17 se menciona en el p\u00e1rrafo 16 que el porcentaje de las cuotas corrientes recaudadas hasta el 25 de septiembre de 1986 fue el m\u00e1s fa vorable registrado hasta esa fecha en los \u00faltimos cinco a\u00f1os. Pero esta tendencia decrece notablemente a partir de octubre debido a la falta de pago del mayor contribuyente. Esto que menciono est\u00e1 en el p\u00e1rrafo 5 del documento 90/LIM 1, y demuestra, junto con los p\u00e1rrafos 38 y 42 del documento 90/17 que los atrasos en el pago de los pa\u00edses de menor contribuci\u00f3n no producen crisis financiera en la Organizaci\u00f3n. La crisis es provocada por la falta de pago del mayor contribuyente. Pasando ahora al documento 90/23, parte 2, y a la luz de la intervenci\u00f3n hecha ayer por la delegaci\u00f3n de los Estados Unidos, nos encontramos con que no se puede ajecutar \u00edntegramente el Programa de Labores y Presupuestos para el presente bienio sin tropezar con un serio problema de liquidez; y que adem\u00e1s, una vez adoptadas las medidas de ajuste sugeridas por el Director General, la FAO tendr\u00eda de todas maneras una crisis de liquidez en 1988. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n considera que la retenci\u00f3n del pago de la cuota debida por el primer contribuyente obedece a razones pol\u00edticas, su sistem\u00e1tico ataque al multilat\u00e9ralismeo es evidente. Si la justifificaci\u00f3n para no pagar sus cuotas es de orden econ\u00f3mico interno, entonces en vez de pagar 100 millones de d\u00f3lares aprobados recientemente para continuar financiando la brutal agresi\u00f3n externa en contra de Nicaragua se deber\u00eda entregar ese dinero a la FAO. Cien millones son los que el principal contribyente debe a la F AO para el bienio 1986/87. Ser\u00ed a m\u00e1s beneficioso para la humanidad entera financiar a la FAO y no a los mercenarios. Nuestro pa\u00eds atribuye a la FAO una gran importancia porque la considera una Organizaci\u00f3n transparente, indispensable y eficaz en el campo del desarrollo agr\u00edcola y de la producci\u00f3n de alimentos; por esto lamentamos que d\u00e9 manera unilateral e ilegal el mayor contribuyente retenga pagos debidos a la Organizaci\u00f3n. Nicaragua pag\u00f3 ayer, 19 de noviembre, a la Oficina del representante de la FAO en mi pa\u00eds, la cantidad total debida a la FAO hasta la fecha, a pesar de los da\u00f1os econ\u00f3micos y los da\u00f1os a la producci\u00f3n que nos ha producido la agresi\u00f3n externa. Estos da\u00f1os se calculan ya en m\u00e1s de 2 500 millones de d\u00f3lares, es decir 25 veces m\u00e1s de lo que el principal contribuyente debe a la FAO. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n desea asociarse con las intervenciones hechas ayer por los representantes del Brasil, M\u00e9xico, Cuba, Colombia y Argentina, y apoyamos las propuestas hechas por el Director General contenidas en el documento 90/23 para hacer frente al d\u00e9ficit financiero del bienio en curso, en el entendido que el Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica no ser\u00e1 modificado en lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo y que el Director General podr\u00e1 recurrir a cr\u00e9ditos a corto plazo para hacer frente al problema de liquidez a principios de 1988 . Vanrob ISARANKURA (Thailand): commending the Director-General, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr Crowther and Mr Shah for their very clear presentation of the financial position of our organization. -164- On this item, my delegation would like to express our position as follows: First, like other previous speakers we support the view expressed by the Finance Committee that other Member Nations should not be called upon to compensate for the deficit caused by reduced payments by any contributor, as each and every Member had accepted the of of assessed contributions as a ition of membership also this Council should strongly appeal to all Member Nations to make remit contributions feasible solution as indicated in paragraph 22 of the document CL 90/23, that is to allow the Director-General to make programme adjustments of an amount of US$ 16, 4 million and to draw on the working capital fund for the amount of US$9 million. Thirdly, we are pleased to note that the Director-General did not propose to reduce operations under the Technical Cooperation Programme. As a representative of a recipient country, the Thai delegation has always emphasized that TCP is an important range of assistance that is important developing countries. my delegation wishes programme has always promptly to emergencies and to the needs and priorities of my government. If we need to make a further adjustment, my delegation strongly opposes the idea of reducing the operation under the TCP. We are of the view that we should maintain the budget for TCP as it was approved by the last Conference. Finally, to endorse the measures proposed by the Finance Committee as indicated in paragraph 31 of the document and recommend the Committee should continue to pursue this qu'il a l'honneur de pr\u00e9sider. En effet, il termes et appropri\u00e9s, faire partager \u00e0 notre pays membres qui ne pas notre Organisation et, partant, au multilat\u00e9ralisme. Le Congo pour part, financi\u00e8res, a honor\u00e9 la ses engagements vis-\u00e0-vis de notre Organisation, et c'est fort de cela que nous d\u00e9plorons que le plus grand contribuant se soit d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de travail. En effet, certains en de pays respecte sans doute la d\u00e9cision de ce grand pays de l'unanimit\u00e9 qui s'est faite sur la principale cause de la que nous analysons en ce moment. Nous esp\u00e9rons simplement que les repr\u00e9sentants du plus Organisation seront interpr\u00e8tes aupr\u00e8s du et r\u00e9jouissons du fait que la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation ce pays qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas dans les intentions de son pays de ne jamais honorer ses a contributions plus grand bailleur de fonds de notre Organisation plonge le Secr\u00e9tariat dans avec tous les risques comporte pour les pays en d\u00e9veloppement\u00b7 La d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de mon pays partage l'avis exprim\u00e9 par ami Danemark pour chaque Etat doit se effet, convocation faire face \u00e0 la crise bien que, il faut bien le dire, nous ne le fassions pas de gaiet\u00e9 de coeur. Certes, on pas des m\u00eames questions. Il s'agit ici de la vie des hommes et nous avons admis que le premier droit de l'homme est nourrir; d'engendrer la moment critique, comme mardi-et, soit sauvegard\u00e9 et pays ne paient pas un tribut trop lourd \u00e0 la suite de ces ajustements de programme qui vont toucher 3, 7 pour cent du budget l'Organisation. bien dit repr\u00e9sentant du des pays en d\u00e9veloppement qui en sont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires pensent il est certain qu'on y recourra davantage encore la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation hier repr\u00e9sentant du Royaume-Uni M. Shah dont chacun de nous respecte la comp\u00e9tence et le s\u00e9rieux dans le travail en du Royaume-Uni. En effet, ce document a, il faut bien le dire, failli le trouble r\u00e9percuter positivement pensons que ext\u00e9rieur b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de notre confiance. Pour conclure, nous voudrions dire nous prenons note du rapport Comit\u00e9 financier tout en esp\u00e9rant financi\u00e8re de l'Organisation tout en notre esp\u00e8re a politiques et essayer de se cantonner dans les documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 par le et qui sont les documents officiels de la Conf\u00e9rence. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Primeramente, se\u00f1or Presidente, antes de darle las gracias como se acostumbra, quiero reconocer que usted es una personalidad de gran prudencia, prudencia que a veces hay que reconocer en los hombres, pero hay veces que esta prudencia puede traernos consecuencias muy peligrosas para el futuro. Por lo tanto, yo voy a cumplir con usted, voy a referirme como miembro soberano de este Consejo a lo que se discute aqu\u00ed, a lo que se ha expresado en la sala. En funci\u00f3n de esto voy a hablar. Ayer, se\u00f1or Presidente, expres\u00e9 mi preocupaci\u00f3n de que la generalidad de los miembros del Consejo que hablaron antes que nosotros se refirieron al problema planteado por el primer contribuyente; y nos preocupaba que estuvieran hablando del primer contribuyente sin que \u00e9ste hubiese hablado. Nos parec\u00eda que respet\u00e1bamos a ese contribuyente esperando que hablara para poder saber cu\u00e1les son los problemas, los problemas que puede confrontar ese gran contribuyente que fue uno de los grandes pa\u00edses que crearon el Sistema de las Naciones Unidas; que fue en los Estados Unidos donde surgi\u00f3 el Tratado de las Naciones Unidas firmado por el Congreso y aprobado por el Congreso de Estados Unidos. Ese Tratado de Naciones Unidas que ese gran pa\u00eds firm\u00f3, ahora lo quiere destruir, seg\u00fan lo expresaron ayer, yo no estoy afirmando nada; nos expresaron que ellos no ten\u00eda nada contra la FAO, que era una reacci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos contra el sistema de la familia de Naciones Unidas. Asi lo expresaron ayer los representantes de la Administraci\u00f3n actual de Estados Unidos. -167- Nosotros, se\u00f1or Presidente, queremos entrar en el fondo del problema en lo que realmente afecta a la FAO. Nos preocupa la forma prepotente, nos preocupa porque aqu\u00ed no se ha utilizado nunca por los representantes habituales de ese pa\u00eds, sin embargo ayer en forma prepotente se nos ha dicho, adem\u00e1s amenazando, que no pagar\u00e1n y que no lo har\u00e1n hasta que los 18 sabios decidan el futuro de las Naciones Unidas. Nosotros conocemos la funci\u00f3n de los 18 sabios que est\u00e1n estudiando cuidadosamente las necesidades de que despu\u00e9s de AO a\u00f1os de estructurar esta gran obra, que tiene entre su principal funci\u00f3n evitar otra cat\u00e1strofe universal, esos sabios est\u00e1n tratando de perfeccionar el sistema, recoger errores, s\u00ed, naturalmente somos hombres y en el devenir del tiempo los errores se cometen; pero si tenemos valent\u00eda podemos tratar de rectificar. Esos sabios est\u00e1n estudiando eso. Esos sabios nunca han recomendado que hay que destruir primero para despu\u00e9s construir. Ellos est\u00e1n rectificando en los mismos cimientos que se ha construido durante AO a\u00f1os. Por lo tanto nos preocupa que un representante de un gran pa\u00eds como ese nos diga aqu\u00ed que hasta que no se estudie el futuro de las Naciones Undas el Congreso de Estados Unidos no podr\u00e1 aprobar nada para la FAO. Nosotros queremos decir, se\u00f1or Presidente, que hay algunas contradicciones. Primeramente esto que digo de que los sabios no est\u00e1n estudiando para destruir, sino para rectificar. Pero tambi\u00e9n nos preocupa que ese pa\u00eds invoque al Congreso para decirnos que leyes de su Congreso le impiden pagar. Repito que en los pa\u00edses donde hacen valer sus poderes del Cuerpo Legislativo, este Cuerpo aprueba los Tratados Internacionales, y este Acuerdo est\u00e1 por encima de las leyes de ese Cuerpo, porque sino, se\u00f1or Presidente, d\u00f3nde podemos encontrar credibilidad de ese gobierno; a d\u00f3nde van a parar los compromisos internacionales cuando cada cuatro a\u00f1os puede cambiar un grupo gobernante y decidir no seguir pagando, e interpretar unilateralmente que la sociedad tiene que cambiar completamente. Nosotros queremos, se\u00f1or Presidente, y esa es nuestra intenci\u00f3n, decir hoy que la actitud asumida demuestra con dram\u00e1tica realidad que el centro de todos los ataques al Sistema de las Naciones Unidas y sus Organismos especializados se encuentra en Estados Unidos de Norteam\u00e9rica. He dicho esto despacio porque voy a ejercer mi derecho como estado soberano para que en el informe apararezca, aunque se diga una sola delegaci\u00f3n. Nosotros queremos expresar en esta situaci\u00f3n que Cuba insta a denunciar los hechos para impedir que el af\u00e1n estrecho y unilateral de Estados Unidos destruya la obra estructurada durante AO a\u00f1os. Si hay crisis financiera en los organismos del Sistema tiene su origen en la cruzada de Estados Unidos contra el multilateralismo. Para terminar, se\u00f1or Presidente, no vamos a referirnos m\u00e1s a este punto, vamos a tranquilizarnos. Voy a referirme a las consecuencias de esta situaci\u00f3n, y le pido a la distinguida representante de Estados Unidos que tenga tranquilidad, que ya tendr\u00e1 oportunidad de responder. Nosotros, cuando llegamos en la ma\u00f1ana de hoy, esper\u00e1bamos otro ambiente y nos sorprendi\u00f3 realmente el ambiente que habla, ya que esper\u00e1bamos una atm\u00f3sfera din\u00e1mica para tratar de salvar lo que tenemos; sin embargo nos encontramos un poco con temor a que se trataran las cuestiones tratando de cambiar los mecanismos de discuei\u00f3n. Nosotros en la intervenci\u00f3n de ayer apoyamos las medidas aportadas por el Director General, porque consideramos que son totalmente justas y que son las \u00fanicas que en estos momentos pueden ayudar a resolver el problema durante 1986/87, independientemente del pago del gran contribuye nte. Sin embargo, ayer omitimos apoyar la petici\u00f3n de cr\u00e9dito. Creemos que la FAO est\u00e1 totalmente en condiciones jur\u00eddicas de solicitar los cr\u00e9ditos que necesite y seria totalmente apoyado por los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo, que saben que esos cr\u00e9ditos van a revertir en cumplir un programa hacia el Tercer Mundo. Por lo tanto queremos unir nuestras voces a los muchos delegados que nos han precedido y que ee han referido a este punto de los cr\u00e9ditos. Tambi\u00e9n me preocup\u00f3 o\u00edr que iba a participar en el Grupo de Redacci\u00f3n los Estados Unidos de Norteam\u00e9rica. Es una decisi\u00f3n regional que no la voy a cuestionar, pero me preocupa la participaci\u00f3n de un pa\u00eds que plantea que no va a estar sentado aqu\u00ed en 1987, como dijeron ayer. Finalmente, voy a plantear que nos ha parecido muy completa en la ma\u00f1ana de hoy la intervenci\u00f3n del representante del Congo, as\u00ed como la declaraci\u00f3n que hizo la distinguida representaci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Alemania en la que dijo que tratemos de buscar f\u00f3rmulas que nos permitan salvar a la FAO. En ese sentido creo que hay que buscarlas, pero hay que buscarlas con posiciones de negociaci\u00f3n, no con barreras unilaterales que no van a permitir una discusi\u00f3n sana en el seno de esta Organizaci\u00f3n. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I too would to hear dialogue rather than confrontation. I wonder, hearing what I have just been hearing, whether to be angry or sad. Of course, it is always a mixture of both. I remember in a context in earlier days when something like this happened, and again I said that I didn't know whether to be angry or sad. A good friend of mine, the delegate of India, said, \"You know, this reminds me of an old proverb\" (I think a Chinese proverb) \"I don't know why that man hates me. I never did him any good\". That was the comfort that my good friend brought to me. I am not going to trouble or take the time of this distinguished -168- meeting to describe my feelings, but I think that there are one or two things that have to be said. For God's sake don't give us lessons to say, \"Give little, then you will never be blamed if you come to a time when you have to give a little lees. Do not be the major donor. \"For God's sake, do not get into that position or you will be the target for every arrow. What is our position? We speak of debt. We have a tremendous debt, an Incalculable debt, in addition to which we have a tremendous trade deficit. We buy from the developing, and all othe r countries, 148 billion more than we sell. We are in a very serious financial situation. No one says that we are going to abandon FAO. If there is any such suggestion, I can give you a letter that came only today. We recognize what FAO has done-not just in the financial or commercial ends, with all this information used by NASA and NOAA on fishing and so on, but in the humanitarian aspects of FAO which, as those who know me here know, that that is what I care about the most. I am not an expert on any financial or business field but I have spent my life in civil rights in my own country and I am concerned about human beings everywhere. I would like to say to some of our dear friends that I was in Congress when one of the countries, that has now attacked us very severely, managed to somehow persuade the dictator to leave. I immediately voted fo r $150 million so that that country would move into free elections, free press and everything that we had hoped the departure of this dictator would mean. We make mistakes. Every country makes mistakes and, of course, we must say that we do too. There is no doubt about it, it is a mistake to have so huge a deficit, to have so huge a trade Imbalance, but we are trying to live in a world in which people have many different ways of looking at things. As I said the other day, we cannot in our country have one man say, \"This is the way it shall be\". We are not trying to destroy the UN. The only reason we feel that 18 wise men studying, as has been wisely said by the distinguished delegate who spoke not long ago, there are ways of improving matters there and it is that hope, that what they come up with as a recommendation for improvement, will be adoped. It would have a great effect on our public opinion. Our public opinion is what is going to make the votes possible in the House-where the money comes from. It does not come from the Senate. It does not come from the Administration. And what we count on the 18 wise men for is to show that the United Nations are prepared to accept the study of a reform for the improvement that has been mentioned here. If that is done, that will have a big effect on public opinion. If it has an effect on public opinion it will effect the votes of the House, where the money starts. I beg of you, let us try to discuss these things in some kind of friendly and understanding spirit. I do not mean attack anybody, rebut anything, or say anything rude, but I do think we have very important business. I am like many people here. I have been in these countries and I have seen these people struggling to find some way to preserve the harvest they work so hard for to feed their families for the whole year. I have seen what FAO can do in the way of making suggestions to preserve the maize from the larger grain growers and our other enemies in these countries. This is what is important about what we are doing here. It is an effort together to help the people who need the help most and we do not dignify it with politics and with hard words and with misunderstandings that are aggravated by more hard words. We do it with reaching out. It was Gandhi who said \"You want to help the people, go to the smallest and poorest village you can find. Sit down and listen. See what they want. \"-That is Number 1-\"See what they need, there may be a little difference. Bring everything that is resources, human and material, together to reach that goal and when you have done all you can, go to the next poorest village. \"And that is what I am talking about here, that is what is our business and I do not mean to enter into angry controversy, but I do think a little bit that the record has to be set straight. Augustine K. OSUBAN (Uganda): The Uganda delegation wo uld like to compliment the Chairman of the Finance Committee for the manner in which he Introduced the Financial Committee report. Many speakers have spoken on this subject very clearly. The causes of the crisis have been analysed and suggestions have been advanced to meet the crisis. I only want here to place on record the concern of my delegation about the state of the finances of the Organization. Our position is, as was stated yesterday by the Chairman of the Group of 77, and that is we endorse the Dlrector-General's proposal for bailing the Organization out of its predicament in the short run. Secondly, we are of the view that in the long-run as true believers we have to renew our vows to the organization and fulfill them. Finally, we are concerned that the Director-General's of the Technical Cooperation Programme. The TCP in our view has been the most effective instrument in the hands of FAO for stimulating agricultural development in developing countries and if there was reduction in any way it would render the Organization largely for Bukhari, Chairman of the Finance Committee, and Mr Shah in all respects. I would not spend time reiterating the elements of the document but in short appeal to all Member Nations of FAO and most especially to the main donor of the largest contribution in arrears to make every effort in making payment in order to guarantee the future of our Organization. My delegation has also realized that the FAO Progra mme of tota lling 437 million dollars cannot be fully implemented to its mandate because of a shortfall in the budget as a result supports the following measures to help remedy some the financial problems. One, that the Director-General borrow funds and use them in the interests of the Organization and suffering humanity. Two, that the make programme payments the implementation of his mandate; my delegation does not view the exercise on the programme adjustment as a result of bad management of policy but as one of those business and financial norms that we live with whenever emergencies arise and FAO is no exception. In his programme adjustment my delegation also supports that there should be no reduction in the programme of TCP. TCP is very important to us developing countries, especially Africa, and everyone can attest to that, and we even want to see it improved. We do not support any further cut beyond the saving realized by the adjustment. My delegation would appreciate if many feel optimistic situation but on this unpredictable situation on financial programmes facing FAO in the future we would not hesitate to give full support to the Director-General on those measures proposed. Again my delegation thanks all donors and multilateral ag encies for and financially to eradicate malnutrition, hunger and starvation and it is in that spirit my delegation hopes that we will all carry through a unanimous atmosphere of consensus to appeal to all those in arrears to do so in the interests of suffering humanity of developing countries, most find a new strategy for remitting quickly their contribution which we believe will help the Organization a lot. Abdullah M. K. BOJANG (Gambia): As my delegation takes the floor for the first time I would like to sieze this opportunity to congratulate you and your bureau and to assure you of our full cooperation. Our thanks go the Chairman of the Finance Committee, the Director-General and his staff for the well prepared working documentation which they have presented and for their responses to our queries, so far at least. Speaking at the end of a long debate I am obliged to be brief since roost of the observations of my delegation been adequately expressed by previous speakers. I intervene only to place on record that my delegation shares the concern of members on the precarious and desperate financial crisis our Organization faces. In this regard we support the proposals advanced by the Director-General in a bid to temporarily contain the situation and we share the view that the TCP which plays a vital role in many developing countries should not affected exercise of cuts. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Es una l\u00e1stima, voy a comenzar por decirlo y sin violar su petici\u00f3n, una l\u00e1stima que el t\u00e9rmino \"pol\u00edtica\" est\u00e9 tan desacreditado y que los demagogos hayan contribuido a prostituirlo, cuando su verdadero origen se refiere a una noble misi\u00f3n que es la relaci\u00f3n humana en su m\u00e1s alto nivel para el entendimiento filos\u00f3fico y de las ideas, si no \u00bfc\u00f3mo podemos tener en las Naciones Unidas un Comit\u00e9 de Pol\u00edticas y Programas nada menos que para la ayuda alimentaria-uno de los programas que realmente est\u00e1 cumpliendo una misi\u00f3n y nos reunimos en \u00e9l sin que todav\u00eda haya llegado la sangre al rio? Digo esto porque voy a dedicarme a lo que realmente quiero plantear en mi intervenci\u00f3n. Comenzar\u00e9 por decir que nos complace felicitar al amigo embajador Bukhari por la presentaci\u00f3n del documento, cuya parte anal\u00edtica nos satisface plenamente. Escuchamos en su oportunidad con mucha atenci\u00f3n la declaraci\u00f3n del Director General y respaldamos totalmente las medidas que \u00e9l propone en materia de reajustar el presupuesto de la FAO. De la misma manera queremos expresar nuestro respaldo a las propuestas del documento presentado por el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, en cuyos detalles han abundado ya los oradores que nos han precedido en el -170- uso de la palabra y que en aras de la brevedad que nos pide el se\u00f1or Presidente yo ahorrar\u00e9 repetirlo aqu\u00ed, pero deseamos insistir expresamente en que estamos de acuerdo con la necesidad de hacer algunas reducciones en el presupuesto, pero que ellas no deben afectar al Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica. El PCT. como familiarmente lo llamamos, es el Programa a trav\u00e9s del cual la acci\u00f3n eficiente de la FAO alcanza los mayores beneficios para los pa\u00edses en desarrollo y para aquellos mal llamados subdesarrollados\u00b7 Estamos de acuerdo con el delegado que dijo que el PCT ha mejorado notablemente la imagen de la FAO en el mundo y por ello queremos unir nuestra voz a las de las numerosas delegaciones que han expresado la necesidad de mantener la existencia del Programa, m\u00e1s aun. de procurar su crecimiento y ampliaci\u00f3n a un mayor n\u00famero de poblaciones necesitadas que no cuentan con otra esperanza que la acci\u00f3n de la FAO a trav\u00e9s del PCT para salir de su atraso y de su condici\u00f3n de hombres y mujeres que puedan aspirar a disfrutar de los derechos humanos que les garantiza la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. Queremos y pensamos que el apoyo expresado por muchas de esas delegaciones en relaci\u00f3n con este programa revela aqu\u00ed no s\u00f3lo la bondad del programa, su efectividad, sino sobre todo su necesidad, y es por ello que queremos expresamente mantener nuestro respaldo y su ampliaci\u00f3n. En aras de la brevedad tambi\u00e9n queremos hacer nuestro, y expresar nuestro apoyo a lo expresado por la delegaci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Alemania, especialmente en cuanto se refiere a nuestro papel de pa\u00edses miembros de esta Organizaci\u00f3n y en cuanto a que debemos hacer todos los esfuerzos por mantener la FAO para que pueda continuar su labor. Finalmente, queremos mencionar el punto en cuanto a instar a los pa\u00edses que se hallan con cuotas atrasadas para que se pongan al d\u00eda; y en esta oportunidad quisiera hacer una observaci\u00f3n de que en el documento CL 90/14 como fue publicado en mayo aparece Venezuela como pendiente de su cuota total para 1986 de 1 306 800 d\u00f3lares y nos complace decir que en este momento ya ha aparecido el CL 90/LIM/1, fecha 17 de noviembre, en el cual se corrige esa cifra puesto que Venezuela ha aportado la mitad de su cuota, lamentablemente por la situaci\u00f3n que todos sabemos que atravesamos, y que su deuda pendiente es s\u00f3lo de 789 333 d\u00f3lares. Hemos enviado un telex a nuestro gobierno para solicitar que se nos confirme si para antes de fin de a\u00f1o esa deuda ser\u00e1 saldada definitivamente, y por eso quiero dejar constancia de ello aqu\u00ed. Para satisfacer la petici\u00f3n del se\u00f1or Presidente termino mi intervenci\u00f3n esperando que realmente la situaci\u00f3n de aprobaci\u00f3n del documento del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas llegue a hacerse por pleno consenso y esa es la posici\u00f3n de Venezuela. LE PRESIDENT: Nous en avons termin\u00e9 point important de l'ordre du jour. Nous partageons enti\u00e8rement ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par le Pr\u00e9sident du Groupe des 77, et par les tr\u00e8s nombreux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s qui ont d\u00e9plor\u00e9 la situation actuelle des et qui ont lanc\u00e9 de vibrante appels \u00e0 l'endroit du plus grand qui est le sien en ces p\u00e9riodes critiques pour les pays en d\u00e9veloppement en l'unit\u00e9 africaine, sp\u00e9ciale des Nations Unies et la Conf\u00e9rence r\u00e9gionale de la du jour. Il est ais\u00e9 de comprendre et d'admettre que les documents CL 90/4 et CL 90/17 qui constituent les rapports du Comit\u00e9 financier, ne contiennent que les principales conclusions auxquelles ce Comit\u00e9 est arriv\u00e9 dans ses de ce d'informations ce qui est fort heureusement le cas \u00e0 toutes les sessions. Le chapitres du budget; et 11 a eus. pour relancer l'agriculture dans les pays en ne l'Inde. Je me f\u00e9licite de ce que M. Shah ait pu donner les explications appropri\u00e9es pour bien situer les en un appui technique, en contrele et la r\u00e9alisation des projets de terrain tandis que, et My delegation is very thankful for this opportunity to make our views known to this assembly. We have felt obliged to add our voice to those of the other member delegates because the matter under discussion is very important and one that touches and threatens the very functions of FAO that we regard cardinal. Having gone through the various documents dealing with finances were clear, explicit and very distinctive, I have had time to digest that and the concern of the member delegates who have vehemently stood their ground on the need to ensure that FAO is not decapitated in any way. Even more explicit has been the interventions of the Director-General who has indeed taken the make known all members the situation facing FAO and his moves to arrest the situation. The Director-General has given this august assembly his proposals on measures and adjustments that in the abort-run will steer the Organisation through the crisis by the end of this biennium. My delegation wholeheartedly supports these steps. It is not every day that any major organization accepts and resorte to such measures as those proposed by the Director-General. In his proposals the Director-General has tried to ensure services developing the add our voice commend fear that if further cuts on programmes such as TCP and other important were to be effected this would affect the effectiveness and the function of FAO to the developing countries. I believe this would not be the wish of this Council, nor of the FAO. The crisis facing the developing countries is well-k own to all the delegates here and need not be repeated. -172- The developing countries look up to the International co mmunity and to the multilateral cooperation for support and would therefore not wish an organization like FAO to be crippled. The contributions of FAO in the field of food and agriculture cannot be surpassed by any other organisation and as such we must ensure that its efficiency and role is not compromised. My agrees with delegations who have appealed to Member Nations to ensure that the FAO Programme la not reduced. My delegation feels that an organization the size and magnitude of FAO does require regular re-examlnation and streamlining to ensure that the creation of sections or offices that are of no direct input to its functions does not take place. The proposals of the Director-General are therefore a welcome idea such management clean-up. My delegation wishes to reinstate the stand of my country with regard to the United Nations organizations. we are strong believers in the United Nations cooperation and other international organizations, regional and sub-regional organizations, that are etablished by Member Nations for a common goal and for bettering the standards of human life. We believe that every effort must be made to maintain these organizations, especially the specialized organs, such as FAO, which deal with the basic human elements and requirements, such as food and agriculture. We would not wish to throw the first stone at any Member Nation, especially in the light of prevailing financial and economic constraints facing all countries globally. We nevertheless feel that the level of seriousness is not the same and that many Member Nations can be and are in a position to meet their obligations in time, while there are a few who have to scrape the very bottom of the pot to meet their obligations. We know that a few major member countries have maintained this Organization and many other United Nations organizations out of their magnanimity and generous contributions. Nations obliged to account for the financial expenditures and obligations to the taxpayers. Ve believe that these countr ies have the ability and capacity to continue supporting the United Nations bodies. We therefore appeal to these Member Nations to reconsider and review the need to give the FAO their full-pledged contributions, whose humanitarian role cannot be replicated by any other organization. We believe that FAO has a major duty to play and we hope that its role is accepted even more widely. In the light of the statements made by a number of major contributors, we believe that there is a need for FAO to be more prudent on borrowing and hope that such a move will, not be n ecessary if all Member Nations can meet their obligations. However, we would like to support the Director-General If this had to be found n ecessary as a last resort. We would wish to endorse the statement of the Group of 77 and other delegates who have supported the Director- General's proposals to bail out FAO from the present crisis. We hope that FAO will continue to provide services for the benefit of the suffering Ms by the Director-General in the document CL 90/23, page 5 to deal with the financial problems the FAO is facing now. We also wish to join those delegations which stressed the necessity of a safe-keeping attitude TCP constitutes the most form of assistance the FAO can afford for countries in need, even in the very difficult situation that FAO is facing now. The TCP should be kept operational at least at its present CL A lists the proposed cuts in the 1986/87 biennium as a result of the financial crisis. One of them concerns a reduction in fishery planning importance warn against a reduction in this area. The importance of this activity was underlined by the FAO World Conference on Fisheries and was the subject of a special resolution. Without sound fisheries planning it will be difficult for fishing nations exercise the use of their newly acquired Exclusive Economic Zones. It will not be easy for the Director-General and his staff to weather this financial crisis without damage to some valuable FAO activities, especially in the developing countries. However, ve still trust that these difficulties are temporary and we have full trust and confidence in the Director-General to take auch measures which will ensure the continuation of the most valuable activities and to set clear lines of priorities which can guide the Organization through this crisis. -173- Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Sr. Presidente, ml delegaci\u00f3n en representaci\u00f3n de un Estado fundador de esta Organizaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentaci\u00f3n tiene el deber de hacer uso de la palabra a prop\u00f3sito de este tema 12. 1 y 12. 1(a) de la agenda relativo a la situaci\u00f3n financiera y de liquidez de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Confieso, Sr. Presidente, alguna perplejidad de mi delegaci\u00f3n por la multiplicidad de los documentos producidos sobre este importante aspecto que ha motivado asimismo varias presentaciones. Loe \u00faltimos documentos han aparecido momentos antes de iniciar el debate. Me complace indicar que mi pa\u00eds es uno de aquellos que est\u00e1n al d\u00eda en el pago de sus contribuciones en los organismos internacionales de que somos miembros, incluso en el caso de la FAO. Con esta perspectiva tambi\u00e9n estamos confundidos al comprobar que la FAO ha empezado a tener problemas serlis de no pago de contribuciones. As\u00ed, Sr. Presidente, esta Organizaci\u00f3n inicia su quinto decenio de vida con inquietudes similares a las del resto del sistema de las Naciones Unidas. Parece que se est\u00e1 desdibujando la decisi\u00f3n de cooperaci\u00f3n en la acci\u00f3n individual y colectiva mencionada en el pre\u00e1mbulo de la Constituci\u00f3n de la FAO libremente consentida por los pa\u00edses fundadores citados en la p\u00e1gina 19 de los textos fundamentales de la FAO que en tiempos fue suscrita y ratificada sin reservas. Quisiera mi delegaci\u00f3n, Sr. Presidente, que esta crisis en ciernes fuera solamente financiera y no involucre tambi\u00e9n a la confianza en ella y a su destino. Mi pa\u00eds ha proclamado en Naciones Unidas y expresa igualmente en este Consejo que la responsabilidad de la crisis financiera recae en tres clases de pa\u00edses: a) en los Estados que no hacen sus aportes de forma oportuna, b) en aquellos que adoptan la inaudita actitud de hacer pagos selectivos favoreciendo los programas que coinciden con sus objetivos pol\u00edticos y c) en aquellos que han asumido la actitud ilegal de reducir unilateralmente sus contribuciones violando sus obligaciones libremente pactadas. Resulta asi afectada la buena fe internacional y la credibilidad en los causantes voluntarios e involuntarios de la crisis. Hablamos de causantes voluntarlos e involuntarios por cuanto nos asombran por igual diversas actitudes. En primer lugar, algunos intentos de vincular los recursos de las organismos con el principio de la igualdad jur\u00eddica de los Estados. En igual forma no comprendemos a quienes consciente o inconscientemente, abierta o soterradamente, trabajan por la politizaci\u00f3n de los organismos internacionales de car\u00e1cter t\u00e9cnico con pr\u00e1cticas nefastas que hay que extirpar de todas partee en beneficio de la imagen de las organizaciones, recordando que la cr\u00edele del multilaterallemo se origin\u00f3 en situaciones objetivas y conocidas de todos, pero que hoy pesan duramente sobre toda la comunidad internacional. La delegaci\u00f3n de Chile recuerda que los \u00fanicos motivos que justifican la falta de pago oportuno de las contribuciones a la FAO son aquellas mencionadas en el Articulo III. 4 de la Constituci\u00f3n y \u00e9stas son las circunstancias fuera del alcance de un Estado Miembro, y mi delegaci\u00f3n no ha conocido a nadie que invoque esta situaci\u00f3n. Todos los pa\u00edses y sue respectivos ciudadanos deben hacer sacrificios con sus impuestos para pagar las cuotas en tiempo oportuno. No ser\u00eda justo que ciudadanos de determinados paises tuvieran el poder de sustraerse al pago de las contribuciones y menos a\u00fan para anunciar el incumplimiento de las respectivas normas de derecho internacional cuya aplicaci\u00f3n involucra a la responsabilidad de los Estados y el honor en la palabra empe\u00f1ada por los mismos. Senor Presidente y distinguidos colegas, en comentarios fuera de la sala un amigo me insinu\u00f3 que este caso es de \u00edndole politics y no jur\u00eddica. Con todo, para mi delegaci\u00f3n causa verdadero estupor conocer ayer, d\u00eda 19, que un contribuyente importante indique que no sabe cu\u00e1ndo, cu\u00e1nto y c\u00f3mo pagar\u00e1. Si se acepta tal actitud, no sobrevivir\u00e1 el derecho internacional como instrumento regulador de la vida de relaciones entre las naciones civilizadas. Es una l\u00e1stima constatar esto en Roma, (una remota de tal derecho de hace m\u00e1s de dos mil a os). Sr. Presidente, mi delegaci\u00f3n se asocia a la del Brasil para expresar su insatisfacci\u00f3n por algunas proposiciones del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas contenidas en el documento CL 90/17. Dicha delegaci\u00f3n y otras se refirieron espec\u00edficamente al p\u00e1rrafo 31 \u00edntimamente vinculado al p\u00e1rrafo 30 y al anexo C, que plantea cinco alternativ as. Sin duds alguna, algunos miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas tuvieron tiempo para estudiar ests compleja materia, pero la decisi\u00f3n de este documento CL 90/17, en noviembr e de 1986, no no s ha permitido a todos los Estados evaluar debidamente esta compleja situaci\u00f3n. Dec\u00eda, Sr. Presidente, que, sin duda, algunos miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas deben haber tenido tiempo para estudiar ests compleja materia, pero la edici\u00f3n de este documento CL 90/17 en noviembre del ano 1986 no ha permitido a todos los Estados evaluar debidamente esta compleja situaci\u00f3n, y mi delegaci\u00f3n lamenta no estar en condiciones de pronunciarse en forma alguna al respecto. Igual que otras delegaciones, la m\u00eda debe tomar nota de las medidas de ajuste y austeridad ya decididas por el Sr. Director General, respaldando especialmente el anuncio de que no se afectar\u00e1 el Programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica (PCT). Se\u00f1or Presidente, volviendo al tema central de este debate, perm\u00edtame recordar dos circunstancias: En primer lugar, que la mora de uno no purga ni justifica la mora de otros seg\u00fan un principio de derecho muy conocido; y, 'en segundo lugar, cabe hacer presente que no hay deudores importantes y menos importantes. -174- El gran poeta espa\u00f1ol, Jorge Manrique, canto en las tr\u00e1gicas coplas dedicadas a la muerte de su padre, que la vida es el rio que va a dar a la mar, que es el morir. Que all\u00ed van los r\u00edos caudales, y los otros medianos y m\u00e1s chicos, y que \"allegados son iguales los que viven por sus manos y los ricos\". Con Jorge Manrique debo decir ante este Consejo que ricos y pobres tienen igual deber de colaborar en armon\u00eda para alcanzar los nobles fines de la FAO evitando que \u00e9sta vaya a dar en el mar de la esterilidad y de la inoperancia que todos decimos querer evitar. Crowther. \u00e1 conna\u00eetre son point de vue sur ce point pr\u00e9cis de l'ordre du jour. Sans verser tr\u00e9sorerie contribution du principal bailleur ou, si les optimistes pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent, a une retenue de Nous les motivations de interne chacun nous respect des engagements auxquels un Etat souscrit. 11 est bien difficile de faire comprendre \u00e1 plus de 2 milliards de personnes des pays en voie de d\u00e9veloppement nous ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s grand honore ses engagements surtout dans le sensible, et en tout cas vital, de l'agriculture et de l'alimentation. bien que le probl\u00e8me pour ces pays ne soit pas de m\u00eame nature qu'il d'exportations. 11 faudrait en envisag\u00e9es sont raisonnables et que proportion de 3, 7 pour cent d'\u00e9conomie nous semble le maximum que nous de cette Organisation. Toutefois, que le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction HUMPHRIES (Observador de Panam\u00e1): Por ser nuestra primera intervenci\u00f3n en este nonag\u00e9simo Consejo de la FAO, perm\u00edtame, se\u00f1or Presidente, saludar su conducci\u00f3n de estos debates, y le ruego a usted me permita en mi condici\u00f3n de observador preocupado de este Consejo que me refiera en forma general al tema 12\u00b7 Con mucha atenci\u00f3n ha seguido esta delegaci\u00f3n el curso de los debates de este tema de transcendencia durante toda el d\u00eda de ayer y durante esta ma\u00f1ana y, sobre el mismo, deseamos aprovechar la oportunidad y no dejarla pasar por alto para puntualizar lo siguiente: Primero, apreciamos la exposici\u00f3n del Embajador Bukhari, Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, as\u00ed como la del se\u00f1or Shah, Director de la Oficina de Presupuesto, por la debida claridad sobre ciertas dudas que fueron planteadas en esta reuni\u00f3n. Segundo, compartimos la opini\u00f3n sostenida ya por much\u00edsimas delegaciones, entre ellas Brasil, T\u00fanez, Cuba, M\u00e9xico y Colombia entre otras, en el sentido de que estamos en presencia de una crisis financiera no producida o provocada por la Organizaci\u00f3n, sino por el actual retardo y futura disminuci\u00f3n en sus contribuciones por parte del principal donador. Debido a estas circunstancias y conforme a lo expresado por el Director General en su declaraci\u00f3n Inicial, se ha visto en la obligante necesidad de proponer ajustes en los programas por la suma de 16, 4 millones de d\u00f3lares as\u00ed como en plantearse la necesidad de realizar empr\u00e9s titos en el futuro por hasta 30 millones de d\u00f3lares. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n, como una salida necesaria apoya esta propuesta; pero, a fuerza de ser honesto consigo y con este Consejo, tiene que expresar muy claramente que al examinar los detalles de las actividades que ser\u00e1n aceptadas, conforme el contenido de los suplementos 1 y 2 del documento CL 90/23, siente preocupaci\u00f3n porque considera que existen muchas de las correspondientes a los programas de recursos naturales y cultivos y pesca que esta delegaci\u00f3n tiene que manifestar que le concede importancia significativa. Sobre el programa de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica, PCT, coincidimos con las numerosas delegaciones que se han expresado en el sentido de que \u00e9ste no debe ser en absoluto alterado. En torno a este programa, nuevamente se han intentado diversas cr\u00edticas adversas, como en anteriores oportunidades, pero a nuestro juicio han carecido a todas luces de sustentaci\u00f3n. Nuevamente se ha vuelto a explicar con toda claridad lo referente al aparente saldo no utilizado al pasarse de un bienio a otro. De este programa hablamos, se\u00f1or Presidente, con la autoridad que nos da el ser beneficiarios del mismo en diversos casos, ya sean proyectos de alcance nacional y algunos de alcance regional. Consideramos que la efectividad de este programa de la FAO est\u00e1 fuera de toda duda y discusi\u00f3n. Nos permitimos manifestar que en torno al PCT las reiteradas observaciones que vienen formul\u00e1ndose en torno al mlemo permiten que apliquemos el refr\u00e1n que dice \"que no hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver\". Finalmente, se\u00f1or Presidente la delegaci\u00f3n de Panam\u00e1 es partidaria de que este Consejo formule un firme llamado a todos los Estados Miembros de esta Organizaci\u00f3n, a fin de que cumplan con sus compromisos contraidos. Esto como un gesto solidarlo y colectivo para con la Organizaci\u00f3n, que contribuya a la soluci\u00f3n de la actual situaci\u00f3n financiera, por la cual atraviesa. Javier Gazzo FER NANDEZ-DAVILA (Observador del Per\u00fa): Por ser nuestra primera intervenci\u00f3n per m\u00edtame, se\u00f1or Presidente felicitarle, no s\u00f3lo por su designaci\u00f3n, sino por lo acertado y \u00e1gil en la forma en que dirige usted los debates. Un reconocimiento especial tambi\u00e9n, a nuestro eficaz Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, Bukhari, por lo claro de su exposici\u00f3n, as\u00ed como al se\u00f1or Crowther por las aclaraciones-hechas que nos han permitido dar agilidad al debate dando explicaciones claras a las interpretaciones financieras involuntariamente erradas de algunos pa\u00edses participantes. En esta explicaci\u00f3n quiero mencionar el hecho de que en el caso de los gastos del PCT, la aparente econom\u00eda que ellos consideraban de loa fondos, se trata de fondos que existen f\u00edsicamente en los libros, en los balances, pero que estos fondos est\u00e1n obligados por cuantiosas solicitudes que se hallan en proceso de priorizaci\u00f3n para su ejecuci\u00f3n. Desgraciadamente no se puede cortar con una tijera el 31 de diciembre de cada a\u00f1o acciones que est\u00e1n bajo proceso y aprobaci\u00f3n de ejecuci\u00f3n. Despu\u00e9s de un an\u00e1lisis minucioso y en profundidad de los documentos CL 90/4 y anexos, as\u00ed como el CL 90/23 y CL 90/24, hemos podido percibir con toda claridad que, por primera vez, estamos atravesando una crisis financiera protunda. Inicialmente peneamos que s\u00f3lo era una posibilidad, pero ahora al conocer loe \u00faltimos acontecimientos y declaraciones de la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses, especialmente del pa\u00eds que constituye el mayor contribuyente, vemos que esta crisis es ya una realidad. -176- s obvio y es necesario definir enf\u00e1ticamente que hay una seri e de hechos que injustificadamente se consideran como componentes de esta crisis, pero que no lo son. El hecho, por ejemplo, del retraso del pago de algunos pa\u00edses no constituye m\u00e1s del 5 por ciento del presupuesto, y esto se viene sucediendo repetidamente en los \u00faltimos diez a\u00f1os. Por consiguiente, es un hecho permanente que no tiene nada que ver con la crisis que se ha generado en la actualidad. La crisis se ha generado, pues, exclusivamente por el hecho de que el principal contribuyente de esta Organizaci\u00f3n, motivado por dos leyes internas, est\u00e1 disminuyendo su contribuci\u00f3n e inclusive el d\u00eda de ayer nos ha dicho que no sabe cu\u00e1nto, c\u00f3mo, ni cuando lo van a pagar. Valdr\u00eda la pena que en forma muy somera, por si acaso los miembros de este Consejo no han tenido oportunidad de profundizar estas leyes, podr\u00edamos mencionar que la primera limita el pago a Naciones Unidas y sus Organismos especializados a un 20 por ciento de sus presupuestos, a menos que las Organizaciones establezcan un sistema para los acuerdos en materia presupuestaria, en el que el voto del pa\u00eds tenga un peso proporcional a su contribuci\u00f3n financiera. Como los canales para pedir estas cosas, estas solicitudes, que son muy loables y cada pa\u00eds es soberano de pedirlas, son los canales normales del Consejo y de la Conferencia que fueron agotados sin \u00e9xito y se ha recurrido a esta ley que es una especie de coacci\u00f3n poco elegante porque, al haber perdido en los niveles normales de Consejo y de Conferencia, recurren a la fuerza del dinero y esto es, como digo, poco elegante. Estoy seguro de que si se hiciera un plebiscito en ese noble pueblo de los Estados Unidos, desaprobar\u00edan a esos 400 legisladores mediocres, porque han puesto en juego el prestigio de una naci\u00f3n, que es modelo de democracia, en un acto bastante discutible. La segunda ley prev\u00e9 reducciones progresivas hasta la total eliminaci\u00f3n del d\u00e9ficit mastod\u00f3ntico del presupuesto nacional de ese pa\u00eds en el lapso de unos cinco a\u00f1os. En esto los pa\u00edses en desarrollo no tenemos ninguna culpa de que se hayan excedido en gastos de armamentismo, que hemos siempre desaconsejado, y que hayan agotado cuantiosos dineros de los contribuyentes en medidas proteccionistas, las cuales no s\u00f3lo hemos desaconsejado sino combatido, y entonces para enjugar este mastod\u00f3ntlco d\u00e9ficit en todo sentido estamos pagando justos por pecadores porque nosotros no tenemos culpa de ese d\u00e9ficit, es m\u00e1s, lo hemos sufrido en diversas circunstancias\u00b7 Hemos analizado con toda vocaci\u00f3n y con todo cuidado los documentos CL 90/23 y CL 90/24 y encontramos que estos documentos responden con toda claridad y con toda oportunidad a la soluci\u00f3n de una emergencia que inclusive se ha producido por leyes casi dadas a posteriori, o sea a posteriori de la elaboraci\u00f3n de nuestros programas y del presupuesto, o sea que vienen a tener un efecto retroactivo para la FAO que tiene que enfrentarlas con cierta sorpresa y, digamos, con cierta rapidez. Despu\u00e9s de haber o\u00eddo las interpretaciones y haber tomado la palabra todos los miembros aqu\u00ed presentes del grupo latinoamericano me complace, en mi condici\u00f3n de presidente del Grupo Latinoamericano, manifestar el pleno respaldo incondicional al contenido de las mismas conclusiones y recomendaciones de los documentos 23 y 24, solicitando del Director General que no se toque en lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo el PCT, pues concordamos con las conclusiones que emanaron de un estudio hecho por un grupo de consultores de alto nivel en el que incluso particip\u00f3 un ciudadano de uno de los pa\u00edses Mayores contribuyentes que evaluaron al PCT concluyendo que era la herramienta m\u00e1s valiosa, vers\u00e1til y efectiva con que contaba la Organizaci\u00f3n, y as\u00ed lo entendieron tambi\u00e9n los gobiernos quienes respondieron a este estudio, y sobre todo los pueblos receptores de los beneficios del mismo, con esa profundidad e intuici\u00f3n que tiene el alma popular del bien que se le hace. Finalmente, y siempre en nombre del Grupo Latinoamericano, el cual me honro en presidir, en ocasi\u00f3n de este momento hist\u00f3rico de lucha y de sacrificio le renovamos al Director General nuestro voto m\u00e1s amplio de confianza, no s\u00f3lo como un acto protocolario, sino como un reconocimiento profundo y amistoso de su entrega incondicional y total a los nobles postulados de la Organizaci\u00f3n de la FAO. Esta Organizaci\u00f3n que con tantos desvelos fue so\u00f1ada, con tanto desprendimiento e ilusi\u00f3n por Eleanor Rooselvelt y Mac Dougall, y otros, ellos desde sus tumbas estar\u00e1n juzgando, como as\u00ed lo har\u00e1 la historia, lo infeliz y desagradable de esta coyuntura, que esperamos sea superada cuando vuelva la raz\u00f3n a imponerse sobre los impulsos emocionales de \u00edndole netamente pol\u00edtica. Point of order Point d'ordre Punto de orden A. Daniel WEYGANDT (United States of America): I would simply like to take the floor on a point of order, because I understood that you had previously requested speakers to refrain from political characterization. I think that is a very wise judgment and I would like to see that this particular point of order be maintained because, if not, our deliberations difficult throughout We business on our plates and I would like to see it discussed in a technical manner.

Las causas actuales de la grave situaci\u00f3n financiera quedan perfectamente se\u00f1aladas en estos documentos y las posibles soluciones a corto plazo est\u00e1n propuestas por el Director General de la FAO en el documento CL 90/24 \"Alternativas para afrontar las incertidumbres presupuestarias y financieras\". Del an\u00e1lisis en conjunto de tales documentos, la delegaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola, como pa\u00eds observador en este 90\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Consejo de la FAO quiere hacer las siguientes observaciones. En primer lugar, est\u00e1 totalmente de acuerdo con el contenido del p\u00e1rrafo 24 del documento 90/4 en el que el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas expresa su opini\u00f3n de que no debe pedirse a los Estados Miembros que compensen el d\u00e9ficit ocasionado por los menores pagos de cualquier pa\u00eds contribuyente. La delegaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola se ve complacida con los esfuerzos del Director General de la FAO para reducir gastos generales de los programas de Labores y Presupuestos para el bienio 1986-87 en la l\u00ednea emprendida ya por la FAO en estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os y que pretenden ahora paliar los efectos de la situaci\u00f3n financiera de la Organizaci\u00f3n a corto plazo sin retocar partidas presupuestarias de programas en el campo. En cuanto al tema de los efectos del tipo de cambio lira-d\u00f3lar con respecto a la situaci\u00f3n de tesorer\u00eda de la Organizaci\u00f3n, parece razonable que la pres upuestaci\u00f3n de bienios futuros se realice en las dos monedas de pagos principales, el d\u00f3lar y la lira, presupuestando cada partida en la moneda en que haya de ser realizada. De esta manera, la contribuci\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses miembros de la Organizaci\u00f3n estar\u00e1 ajustada en cada momento y se evitar\u00e1n las fluctuaciones por tipo de cambio que hoy crean dificultades financieras a la Organizaci\u00f3n. Somos partidarios, por \u00faltimo, Sr. Presidente, que se recuerde una vez m\u00e1s a los pa\u00edses con contribuciones pendientes el abono de sus cuotas y se profundice en el estudio de las medidas generales que hagan m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidos y efectivos los abonos de las mismas.

Now that we have the opportunity, our delegation, like all other delegations who we have heard yesterday and this morning, wishes to indicate our positive view and regard for your clear guidance. In this connection, we would also like to thank Ambassador Bukhari and Mr Shah for the excellent introduction to the agenda item under discussion, which has enriched our understanding of the matter and background. Also our delegation would like to congratulate the Director-General for his detailed analysis and summary of the major issues in the area of food production as related to the Food and Agriculture Organization during the opening Session of this Council meeting and indicate our due regard. After the detailed analysis and discussion by the Council members yesterday and also today it would be highly improbable, or even very difficult, for me to introduce new dimensions to the discussions. However, our delegation would like to indicate its support, like the Chairman of the Group of 77 and also other delegations who spoke in support of the measures proposed by the Director-General in order to overcome the financial shortfall that is being faced by the Organization as a short-term measure, with regard to staff savings and programme adjustment for a saving of some $16. 4 million, recognizin g the realities existing and also what seems to be prevailing in the near future. FAO, as a technical agency of the United Nations with responsibilities for the area of agriculture and food production comprehensively and with its technical capability which was developed during the last forty years of service to the international community, will have a very important role to play in the aspirations of achieving increased food production, particularly at a time when the major global and dominating issue is related to food and becoming increasingly so. The present shortfall budgeted due will seriously activities of the Organization over and above depleting the Working Capital Fund and reserves which have always been maintained at a reasonable level in the past. Proposals presented by the Director-General are in anticipation of the uncertainties that are prevailing and therefore we consider it to be a commendable effort and a sign of good management. The views presented will in any case require serious consideration, even more so today than at any other time in the past, due to the critical food shortage situation that was created and is still prevailing in most of the African countries. The area of food being the most important area as far as the well being of mankind is concerned. Direct or indirect support to food production the utmost attention. The uncertainties of financial during this biennium and also in the immediate future will reduce the support that needs to be given to food production which is considered as a priority area of concern on a global level. The need to ascertain a source of revenue, at least in the level of the Programme of Work and Budget which was approved by the 23rd Conference for the present biennium, is both a moral and legal commitment which will have to be considered with the utmost care. With regard to the TCP, which, according to us, is a means of bridging the activities of food production (which are essential) and otherwise not covered due to matters arising, or which have not been anticipated earlier, would also require a different consideration. This situation will always continue to prevail in the future and therefore increases the need for a TCP kind of resource. In the past this has always been useful and has always supported unforeseen shortfalls. It was reported very clearly during the course of this session that over 240 requests wore r eceived, and quite a large number were in the process of approval. We see no possibility that there will be funds left over (or even available) for all their requests. The financial resources budgeted for the TCP should therefore be left unaffected as a consequence of the present financial shortfall. As to the long-term financial situation, this will require further measures outside Our delegation indicates its serious concern and appeals to all those who are in a position to do so to honour their commitments. In this regard a coordinated and avoiding a recurrence of this kind in the future, with the objective of ensuring the viability of this organization whose role always been considered vulnerable. Jaafaru LADAN (Observer for Nigeria): As this is the first time my delegation has taken the floor I would first of ail like to congratulate you Mr Chairman for the manner in which you have been conducting this Council Session, which is, in many respects, a very special session. I should also like to congratulate the Secretariat on the excellent analysis presented on the financial situation of the Organization, and to Ambassador Bukhari for the seriousness with which he has been guiding the Finance Committee and his clear introduction to this agenda item. As my delegation is speaking as an observer we are taking the floor only to echo the support expressed by the members of the Council to the proposals made by the Director-General of FAO, and responding to the induced crisis created for the organization. I \"induced crisis\" because if member countries had not created the in which the FAO finds itself now, there would have been no need to discuss this agenda item, especially as the Conference has approved the Director-General's proposal of Programme of Work and Budget for the biennium 1986/87. It is the hope of my delegation that the Council should be more unanimous in its support of the Director-General's proposals for meeting the present crisis. -183- My delegation also hopes that the situation created for FAO will be of a temporary nature, and that in the future FAO will count on Member Nations to fulfill their obligations to the organization to enable it to discharge the mandate given to it by the same Member Nations during the Conference, which is the governing body of FAO, Javed MUSHARRAF (Pakistan): I apologise I missed some of the debate in the morning and since this is only the second time I have taken the floor I hope to seek your indulgence if I take slightly longer. I hope you will stop me if I am speaking for too long. Having listened carefully to the rather long debate on the subject, I may be sharing a feeling with others, of being a little lost, or rather dazed, but more fascinated at the alternating ups and downs in the debate, the frequent swings from one side to the other, its changing colours and moods, the loss of clarity and certainty at one moment, and the regaining of clarity and certainty at another. A true debate, the rich contributions to which both from the podium and all corners of the hall, can be justly admired. So much has been said, so much has flown over in so many contrary directions that for the dazzled few, or many, (like me) it might be a good idea just to recall what has been said or asked, what may still need to be said and asked; and what has been settled and what may still be unsettled in many people's minds. I propose to recall the debate in a partial and nonpartisan manner and, as you will notice, in a slightly different language will be in a sort of fictional, or if you like, allegorical manner hoping throughout that it will not be misunderstood and will be taken in the same friendly and light-hearted, but nevertheless serious, spirit in which it is intended. The situation which is now being faced by this Organization, and indeed some elements of the situation that we have faced in this Council Session whilst discussing the overall situation, can perhaps be depicted as that of an ancient ship embarked on a long and noble journey but suddenly caught by extremely bad weather. The ship started off full of passengers, faced due East first to admit a new passenger, the USSR, but then soon got caught in that terrible storm-lightning, wind and thunder all coming from the West. The ship is tossing up and down, sometimes going North sometimes going south. The captain raises th e alarm. There is panic on deck, the passengers huddle together, all hopes pinned on the dynamic captain and his competent crew. But there are mutterings of discontent on board, even a show of a little agitation, perhaps mutiny. \"Force majeure\" cries the captain. But the agitators mutter \"Well yes, but how are the crew and the captain doing? Is the ship really being kept in good shape?\" An underlying discontent builds up with a few open mutineers (if I may say so). But the bulk of people-peaceful passengers-still admire and look up to the captain and the crew and cheer at every word and action of theirs to deal with the situation. In the meantime, some exchange takes place between malcontents and the crew-what one of the leading passengers (who is the oldest passenger on board and who has no sympathy with mutineers) describes as an sometimes a little sheepishly cheering every move and action of the crew. It is not yet really a \"mutiny on the bounty\". Virtually all agree, (passengers, crew, captain, and even the mutineers) that it is really the weather that is the immediate problem. They all curse the weather, and the weather gods. All fingers point to one god-the Almighty of the West. The crisis on board is described as an induced crisis. The God has betrayed an earlier promise. A unilateral betrayal of majeure situation is described as su i generis . The like of it was never seen before, it is said. An everlasting storm, perhaps the dawn of an ice age. There is a messenger of the God on board as well (or rather a messengeress-in this case, a charming one). She protests and complains that it is too bad scolding the poor God who is always giving you so much good weather but just this once not giving it. Scold instead the other small Gods around the world who have never given you much. Besides, ours in the United Heavens is not just one God but several of them, in fact 453 of them: Thor, Woden, Saturn, Mercury, Apollo, Zeus, and all. All of them together have to decide the future, whether to give you good or bad weather. It is not like the single lucky chap down in your heaven who just has to sign a check. Our 453 Gods have to first deliberate what sort of weather they will give you. And they are still deliberating. We just have to wait. To quote, \"scold, dear friends, those who do not give you, not those who have given you. \" -184- In the meantime the mice on board the ship, this argument mutter \"What a perfect argument this would be for the rich in the country to justify stopping paying all their taxes horrendous. not here, simply it is still a situation of \"We\" and \"They\" between the heavens. All human beings are the same, but the Gods are not universal. A cry is also raised in one quarter that this is not a North-North South issue. But why not? \"In the ultimate analysis\", we heard from one of the messengers of the Almighty, \"the whole matter is a basic policy issue concerning the stance towards the whole UN The mice again can be heard speculating whether this really means bad weather for all of the UN for all time to come. That would be the end of the agency through which North and South collectively meet; and the South, if nothing else, is able to express its voice. Leaving aside everything else, the question of \"voice\" alone being a major North-South issue, how is this all not a North-South issue? Or is it, (as it seems to be) that unless the rich who pay can have some control over the voice of the poor who receive, they w ill not pay? The general feeling on ship, therefore, is that some scolding (in fact, a lot of scolding) is justified. In fact, however, not much scolding is heard on board. Turk springs up and says \"Certainly, we don't (and scold) our heavenly colleagues here board\". This a scolding is deserved and justified, they also feel that this particular messenger, and the smaller messengers, which the Almighty has so wisely chosen on ship, should spared such a treatment. Why? There is a rather special reason. The messenger of God in Roman mythology is Mercury the same Mercury with wings on his feet and on his cap. If my mythology is correct, Mercury is also supposed to be the Roman God of eloquence, merchandise and theft. Without sounding too ridiculous in trying to raise the ordinary to the sublime, may I venture to suggest-in humour but in earnest-that Mrs Fenwick is God's own ideal Mercury with all those three attributes. She has the greatest of eloquence, a supreme demonstration of which we just heard in that absolutely disarming impromptu little sp eech of hers on \"scolding\". She is the goddess of Merchandise or at least we regard her to be so, expecting from her assistance to deliver the \"merchandise\" which the Heavens have chosen to withhold from us. Above all, she is the goddess of Theft ! Throughout her stay here, she has stolen all our hearts on board the ship. Her assistant messengers are not much less. I will mention only one-J. R., the very opposite of the calculating villain with the same initials in the popular American TV serial of a few years ago on Texas oil magnates. May I venture to say that, were it not for the personal presence here of messengers such as J. R. and our Lady Mercury and the hearts that they have stolen, a far louder shriek and outcry would have emanated today from this ship, against the gods. I wonder whether the big R in the Western heavens (Mr R. R., that is) knows what his small Rs and Mercuries have thus achieved for him here on this small ship in the distant seas. He probably does not. As far as our problem and predicament here is concerned, we can only pray to the gods and request these friendly messengers of his to convey to them, the group of 453, our appeal, our prayer and even a modicum of disappointment and disgust. What may also be perturb the United States Congress quite a bit-that the Japanese are the ones who are happy in the whole situation! As the Canadian passenger acutely observed, they become the ad interim . If Congress hears that the Japanese are going to take over even this \"market\" from the United States, they will, we are sure, take the most prompt protectionist measures, in this case paying up their contributions and cutting out the Japanese from yet another market conquest. In the whole commotion on board and the buffeting and battering that the ship is undergoing in the billowing seas, apart from the Japanese who are happy, for the reason mentioned, there is another remarkable group of passengers who turn out to be, not really happy, but placid and unworried. These are the Vikings! Their leader, the Great Dane, declared amidst all the panic that the sea was not very stormy at all; actually it was far calmer than the Captain and the passengers could see. So while everything was helter-skelter with panic, the lordly Vikings arranged in a more artistic fashion, and so on. Their calm was not really surprising, since it is known what great and brave sea-farers they have always been. They were also heard to be advising the Captain on two more things: that whilst steering the ship to its goal, he should not take just a \"linear\" view but rather look far and wide and choose, from among the many directions, those which may be the best of all; and secondly that he should look the distance rather than just gazing at the waves around him. Again, this was not at all surprising because everybody knows that the Vikings, the great Norsemen, the Jutes, Swedes and Goths had been doing this sort of thing throughout much of their history. They never adopted a narrow, \"linear\" path; they went to the British and the French coasts, turned into the Straits of Gibraltar, landed in Italy, travelled up to Naples. One branch even zig-zagged on land from the north, down the great rivers of the Russian Steppes, reaching the Black Sea area successfully weathering, throughout all these journeys in their long-boats, all sorts of storms and crises. They never took the close view; they always looked far ahead. Leif Eriksson reached America five centuries before Columbus. They perhaps do not even recognise Columbus. Nevertheless, what the great Vikings declared on board our ship the other day leaves a lingering doubt that what they said may have some element of truth. The passenger from Canada thought the opposite. We in the middle are left a little confused. Talking of Columbus, we come to our great friends the Italians, the eternal livers and lovers. Their love, as is known, knows no bounds and can extend beyond the human dimensions. And true enough, the Italian passenger on ship, amidst all the tension and terror on board, was found busy passionately declaring love to Lady Finance. \"My beloved Finance Committee\" he cooed-there is no mistake, it must be in the verbatim record. And while all the cooing and wooing was going on, someone alleged (I think it was the ever-clever British with all their old skill and subtlety) that the lady on ship, that is the much wooed Lady Finance, was wearing only a from the Lady's patrons, the crew of the ship, that \"No, the dress she was wearing was quite \"transparent\". It was not intended to, and fact also if some passengers thought that even more needed to be revealed, they would like to be suitably guided so that they could make the clothes even more \"transparent\". This suggestion was everyone candidly stated that the more \"transparent\" the Lady became, the more they would fall in love with her and her bikini. After this slight and rather inappropriate diversion into the erotic field, which was all precipitated by the irresistible Italians who cannot desist from this activity even in the most dire of circumstances, all the beings on board woke up again to the danger surrounding them and the cry went out that the ship was becoming grounded! There was no liquidity left on which it could float; all the water was apparently drying out. While the situation was still being surveyed, out came a cry-again from the crafty British-that no, in fact there was too much liquidity around, and we were, in fact, in danger of drowning! This created the quite time. And whilst the multitude of the poor passengers could not decide whether to believe their own eyes, the crew's eyes or the British eyes, the crew and the Captain divulged the mysterious secrets of certain adjoining sheets of water and land called \"balance sheets\" and declared that in fact there was, for the present, neither too much liquidity nor too little liquidity, and everything was quite safe! Of course, although hocus-pocus to non-accountants, everyone believed the Captain and the crew in whom they had a religious trust. In any case, in the state of panic and confusion, such comforting thought ability of the ship to keep afloat, some of the more apprehensive and passengers a signals. They thought that the ship was too heavy and had, in fact, always been too heavy with too many people on it, and therefore in the interests of the survival of everybody some people must be thrown overboard. For this they made an elaborate estimate of the useful crew and equipment and the less useful-those who were engaged in real work, and those who were merely in some way supporting them. The direct workers, whom they called field workers, were the oarsmen who with their oars were doing ail the work of pulling the ship along, while there was a large body of people and equipment used merely to \"oversee\" or cheer the workers along-like playing the and so on. Of the latter category they thought there were too many , that there was too high a \"delivery cost\" in the programme as opposed to the programme itself, and that many of the drummers could be thrown overboard. However, the Captain and the crew came quickly to the rescue of these hapless people by saying in pulling the oars, and that in -186- case of one particular overseer, for example, although he never pulled drafting and laws which prevented the oarsmen from leaving their job and clashing with the others. It was finally concluded that at this stage it was not clear exactly how many were real workers and how many were not. The passengers were left expecting that someone would meant and their proper enumeration. Another idea emanating from the Captain was that some of the additionally needed staff or crew members might not at this stage be recruited to the ship, at least for some time to come. But the Canadian passenger pointed out that the decision hardly workers do not normally exist anywhere; they are sort of ghost people only in the books, and the saving of $9. 5 million was therefore only a notional figure and hardly a real saving. Therefore, some real people might well be added to the list and they might considerably expand the list of postponed may exist without damaging the programme in a major way. Mr Chairman, I had a number of other points in a similar vein regarding the proposals emanating from the the proposed in programme expenditure, the TCP, the Working Capital Fund, and the possibility of borrowing. But in view of the paucity of the time resources, I may here impose a \"programmed cut\" on it and refer to them, if possible, at some other opportune moment\u00b7 To conclude now, Mr Chairman, may I suggest firstly, that the ship is good enough. It has many poor people on it, and it should be saved and helped, and not abandoned. Secondly, the Captain and the crew are also good. Their dynamism and dedication is have legitimate grounds to think that, as a matter of principle, Captains everywhere should be confined to some finite period of captaincy. Thirdly, that as far as the present debate is concerned, the Captain and the crew will no doubt answer and clarify (now or in due time) the many interesting and pertinent questions which have arisen in the debate always keeping in mind the interests of the deprived communities and nations of the world whose interests FAO is mandated to S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et M. le Ministre de (Czechoslovakia): delegates have already emphasised the importance of the item for agenda. Allow me on behalf of Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria as Council Members to thank His Excellency Dr Bukhari and Mr Shah for their introductions and clarifications. All of us are aware of the financial difficulties in the whole United Nations System, FAO included. We know of the efforts of the Director-General and the FAO Secretariat and we know various proposed ways and means which aimed at problems. Our proposals are simple and clear. First of all, we appeal to all Member Countries, both large and small, rich and poor, to take all necessary measures in order to pay their contributions to the FAO budget as soon as possible. We support the intention to preserve the technical and economical programmes of the Organization to the maximum the activities regarding needs in developing countries and direct field impact. Eventually, as to the economies suggested in the travel. At the conclusion of my speech, I would like to refer to document CL 90/LIM/1, page 5, and to inform the Council that since 15th November when this document was published Czechoslovakia has already paid a second part of its contribution que sommes en train d'examiner pour la vie de l'Organisation et sa p\u00e9rennit\u00e9. Je possible d\u00e9bats. J. SHAH (Director, Office of Programme, Budget and Evaluation): As I am given the floor to respond to some of the comments which have been made and which require clarification, or call for clarification, may I, first of all, be permitted to express on behalf of the Director-General, despite his presence here, his appreciation for the very careful consideration given by the Council to the matters which you have just considered. The reaction of the Council is extremely clear. There is no doubt, and indeed there is total agreement, of the serious situation affecting the implementation of the Programme of Work for this biennium and the fact that it requires corrective measures. is that the situation is fluid. It is subject to change, and will change, but we cannot stand by impassively and that has led to the measures which have been proposed by the Director-General. The debate concentrated very much on the nature the scope and the level of the proposed adjustments. It might help the Council if 1 were to distinguish between the two terms which were used at times synonimously. On the one hand economies and on the other hand, adjustments leading to economies-induced savings. The Director-General has always been a prudent manager of this Organization. This is not the opinion of one who serves him but it is the opinion of his governing were felt that these savings occurred by chance, or by good fortune, let me draw attention, very briefly, to the views of the Council when it considered the Annual Report of budgetary performance dealing with the biennium 1982-83 where there were savings of over $15 million. The report of the Council of the 1986 session says, in paragraph 145, \"The Council expresses and commended the Director-General on his prudent management of the resources at his disposal. \" The Director-General has always made it clear that he is a prudent manager and intends to be so. What we are now dealing with, however, and what is represented which they do not affect programme activities in this way, then there would be something doubtful about the adjustments. There has been considerable debate about the level of these adjustments. Should they be more, or should they be less? We then listened attentively to all points of view. I can only recall what the Director-General himself said yesterday. I do not need to repeat it, except to say that there are advantages and disadvantages. There is a limit to what is possible and what is not possible. A number of distinguished delegates have asked about used proposals for adjustment. Some have questioned \"Why a cut. The level of adjustment is not even at the same rate across all programmes. \" This is essentially a question of what is possible pragmatically and what is not, for example, the posts. We review a total of 248 posts vacant now and expected to be vacant in 1987. This list is not permanent, it is not unchangeable. Developments in 1987 w ill show whether other staff will retire, resign or pass away. What is important is that there is a system for looking at every such vacancy as it arises. Every such vacancy was individually examined and duration of the the recruitment action under way and, -188- most important of all, the programme implications of delayed filling. As was pointed Director- this requires managerial judgment. A judgment which he exercised and in which we, his colleagues, helped him to exercise as to what it would mean not to fill a post for two, four or five months. To realise that certain work would be affected but to accept that it would be affected. In other cases to stay firm and say, \"No, wo cannot allow it to be affected. of the total number of posts examined, there are some 170 which are affected. Some might argue that every post should have been To our minds, and this reflects also the comments of many, many distinguished delegates that an A at stage would have even and careful approach meetings, expert consultations, seminars and the extent preparation visits were in course, what or studies involving joint sponsorship with other Agencies which part an established series of gave an impact which was either indefinite or which did not have any urgency in terms of time. The distinguished delegate of Bangladesh was the only one who referred to a specific meeting, a meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group on Jute and requested clarification as to why this was among the list of adjustments. I think it gives a good example. One Group on Jute is already planned for December of this year. The meeting which is now included in the adjustments list was a session which was planned for December 1987. Our colleagues dealing with the subject felt that it was reasonable to postpone it into the next biennium. It may be held early in the next biennium and they took into account particularly the fact that there are also meetings of the International Jute Organization. I give this as an example but I felt also as this particular meeting had been raised as a query I should comment on it. On publications, the criteria employed were the status of the preparation of the document, the extent of the work already completed, the commitment made and the work undergoing through consultancies and contracts and the degree of urgency for the issuance of a publication, whether in a forthcoming or to another programme commitment. All this has resulted in what the Director-General referred to as a package and it is a package in which he himself has emphasized the need for flexibility, flexibility in adjusting the package to respond to the needs as they are felt with the possibility of raising the level of the package if the situation so demands and if it is possible and with the possibility of restituting some items if the situation were more favourable. The last aspect, if I may comment on it, is the question of programme adjustments in some of our sister organizations. I should firstly like to say that we have tried to fol low these developments very closely, not only to learn from them but also to see whether the experiences are comparable. Let me take firstly the example of the International Labour Organization. The budget of the ILO for this biennium is 253 million dollars, just a little more than half our biennial budget. programme adjustments proposed by Director-General to his governing body, that is the governing body of 66 Member Governments and their representatives was for a package of 18. 8 million dollars, but as the Director-General recalled yesterday this package was reduced by one and a half million dollars to 17. 3 million dollars because the governing body ILO's Technical Cooperation Programme should be cut as had been proposed. So out of the total of 17. 3 million dollars let us look at what is involved. It is quite openly admitted in the ILO document that of this 17 million, 10 million are savings which would have occured in any case because of an excessive provision for staff costs. So the real adjustment, the real programme adjustment is 7. 3 million dollars, 2. 77 percent of the ILO budget. The fact the included such -189- an excessive provision may raise a similar query in the minds of some members so let me try and forestall that. The cost increases in our budget for this biennium were pruned very sharply to what we consider the absolute minimum. When you consider that our budget for the last biennium was 421 million dollars and the budget now is 437 million dollars, an increase of 16 million dollars, of which 5 million was programme increase, the cost increase was 11 million. In the ILO budget proposal the cost increase was almost double. This explains the reason for the change. Before I conclude on ILO, as was mentioned, the ILO budget which was submitted to the governing body has been approved by its committee as a package. In the case of the World Health Organization an amount of 35 million dollars has been set aside and this compares with the WHO budget of 543 million dollars, 6. 45 percent. There is no description of this package which has yet been submitted. The description will be submitted to the World Health Organization Executive Board in January. I hope these few remarks have clarified the main questions which were raised and I would like to thank you again. Dean K. CROWTHER (Assistant Director-General, Administration and Finance Department): There were a couple of additional questions that were focused specifically that I think should be responded to. One was the question of whether or not the working capital fund would have to be repaid and the answer is, very simply, yes, it must be repaid. I would like to refer you to the basic text under Section 6. 2 of the Regulations which are the financial regulations which makes reference to the Working Capital Fund and the fact that it is provided for advancing to r eceipt of contributions to the b udget. Then in 6 5 of the same regulation it makes reference to the fact that advances from Working Fund to finance budgetary expenditure under Regulation 6. 2(a) (i), which is the one 1 just read to you, shall be reimbursed from the general fund as soon as feasible but in any case within the next financial period by programme adjustments if necessary. So again very simply, yes, it must be repaid. Secondly a question was raised with respect to Italian the organi zation since 1972. During this period of time there have been differing amounts that have been provided, mostly for purposes that identified under trust agreements that there would be an agreement on the use of the funds and they have been used for rather specific purposes, particularly earlier on. Then during a period about four years the fund continued to receive contributions but no expenditure was made and a balance had begun to develop. At that point of time the Italian Government expressly said in the 1985 contribution that it would be used to offset the cost of rent, which it was, and now through an agreement with the Italian Government we are going to have an exchange of letters for the distribution of the balance of the fund. Since it is a voluntary contribution, certainly it is at the behest of the contributor as to the specific use since that is the way the fund was originally set up. The organization is very appreciative of receiving those funds and they have been most useful for the purposes they have been intended for. I think that responds to the question that was raised. Atif BUKHARI (Chairman, Finance Committee) (original language Arabic): In fact I have not much to add to what has been mentioned here, especially as we have sufficiently discussed the reports of the Finance Committee. I think that ail those present have expressed their agreement with what was mentioned in both reports. In fact this reflects the confidence the Council places the Finance Committee which saved no effort to carry out its activities to the benefit of all. The Finance Committee with all its members have tried to work very candidly in a transparent -190- fashion in its dealings with the Secretariat of this organization. I would like to assure you all, members of the Council, that cooperation and frankness were the main characteristics of our relationship with the Secretariat of the organization as is evidenced by those reports. We are most appreciative of the fact that you have accepted both reports. Y. BUKHARI Arabia, Kingdom of:) (original language Arabic): If you allow me to express myself as a member of the Council, namely as the delegate for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who is not in his seat, for he is with you under another hat, as it were, as the head of the Finance Committee. Please allow me then to express my opinion as regards document CL 90/23 and make a few comments on it. I repeat I am addressing you in my capacity as the representative of Saudi Arabia. I would like to say that it is unjust to ask the Director-General to implement the totality of the Programme of Work and Budget for 1986/87 withou t providing him with the n ecessary liquidity as has been agreed in the Conference. I would like also to say that it would be unnatural and illogical to ask him to make reductions as regards the most important programme of all, i. e. the TCP, which is the very backbone of the organization's activities and which benefits greatly the world, simply we do not want to honour our financial contributions for one reason or another. If we do not respect the integrity as it were of the TCP, then what remains for the developing countries and for FAO by the same token? The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia places its full confidence in the person of the Director-General, Dr Edouard Saouma, and through this august assembly my delegation would like to reaffirm its confidence. We are in fact we have been watching closely the degree of efficiency of the activities of this organization during the mandate of our Director-General. We are most aware of his capacity and his wisdom at the helm of this organization. Therefore, and because we are most confident that this organization is pursuing appropriate objectives, we have signed a protocol of agreement, between our government and FAO. This cooperation agreement is most important signed unreservedly forward by as well as the reductions regarding administrative activities. We hope that this reduction will not detract from the efficiency of this organization. We are confident that the Director-General is very aware of what he is doing and that in fact he is very able to guide our path. LE Si vous n'y pas ordre du de la pr\u00e9sente session. J'ai not\u00e9 que le Conseil a fait part de sa pr\u00e9occupation financi\u00e8re de principal contributaire. Cependant, le Conseil not\u00e9 avec satisfaction que le son intention de poursuivre sa contribution de la FAO et que sa contribution n'est pas remise en cause. A cet \u00e9gard, l'espoir mission de l'Organisation strictement tributaire de la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans cet esprit que le Conseil part de son approbation les rapports par -191- Comit\u00e9 financier au cours des cinquante-septi\u00e8me et cinquante-huiti\u00e8me sessions et a not\u00e9 l'importance de la r\u00e9union du Comit\u00e9 financier qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e pour le 16 et le 17 d \u00e9cembre prochains. C'est toujours dans cet esprit majorit\u00e9, mesures propos\u00e9es le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la FAO (dans paragraphe 35 du CL 90/23 tendant \u00e0 r\u00e9viser de A cet \u00e9gard, le Conseil, dans sa quasi-totalit\u00e9, a not\u00e9 que la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des Etats Membres ont pour que qui rend grand service aux pays en d\u00e9veloppement et qui a am\u00e9lior\u00e9 l'image de marque et l'efficacit\u00e9 de la FAO ne soit touch\u00e9 en rien. Conseil raised my flag because I was hoping to hear in your summary, Mr Chairman, or some other part of the concluding session a reflection of my delegation's suggestion, which was supported by at the issue overhead costs should be referred the You have chosen to omit this because of the offer made by Mr. Shah that he would be happy to r eceive representatives of the United Kingdom to talk over misunderstandings and so on, and indeed we are very happy to accept that invitation and will arrange for a meeting at Mr. Shah's convenience, but I do not expect that such a meeting will do more than make it possible to do some more accurate commentary on this question. It seemed from the are issues overhead costs and allocations which ought to be attention of the Finance Committee for further consideration. I do agree with the delegates who said it was perhaps unfortunate that we went into this in a straightforward way initially here rather than in the Finance Committee. So if it is n ecessary to do it I would now propose that it be put to the Finance Committee as its next regular meeting, not the D ecember one obviously. As to papers for this, my delegation will be very happy to produce a paper after discussing it with Mr. Shah, and while I am on papers perhaps I might say that the paper which we circulated, and which was criticised for not having been in all pigeon holes at the right time, I just give warning that my delegation proposed to refer to it again under another agenda item in a quite different context. Perhaps to make our might permitted to give further copies to the Secretariat. Perhaps it could be circulated as a Conference Room paper to avoid difficulty over this. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): 1 had asked for the floor before you began your summing up, Mr. Chairman, but perhaps it is more appropriate that I come in at this time to make comments. The reason I asked for the floor earlier was that the interventions by Mr. Shah, and shortly before that by the delegate of Pakistan, Mr. Musharraf, had reminded me of the information that I had received some time ago that there was a manager to emulate, and I think Mr. Shah's quotation from his paper was drawing attention to the Council's views on the good management practices of our Director-General. But I had once been told that the world's best manager was a chap called Noah, Noah being the only man ever to float a company when the whole world was in liquidation. I had asked to take some issue with the I thought somewhat discursive approach that Mr. Shah took to the ILO budget by suggesting that it was only a 2. 77 percent reduction rather than a 7+ percent that had been made and on the grounds that some $10 million of their saving was gratuitous saving, and admittedly so because of over- estimation or one such thing. If one wants to be argumentative one can take issue with any figure quoted throughout the UN system, including the FAO figure of 3. 7 percent, insofar as we may say that the vacancy rate itself provides the gratuitous $6. 5 million saving and therefore if we divide the residual $9 million it is only a two point something percent saving. You will agree of course, but that nevertheless would be one calculation that I could make. -192- Be that as it may, with respect to your summing up I take it that you have found the Council endorsing three specific points. Those points were that the measures proposed in document CL 90/23 were accepted by the Council. Our delegation and a number of others did not find them necessarily sufficient for the purpose and had made our views known quite clearly in that respect. You decided that the Council would take further measures in June. In June the Organization will only have six months left in the biennium and I think we could despair of taking any additional operational would be too little time left to us. We have made the view that further measures should if not be taken at this time be put in place to be taken at a much earlier date than that. The third point I noticed was that the Council had unanimously supported the TCP. 1 think there were a number of suggestions that this was a Programme which, amongst others, might bear some further scrutiny. There were a number of other issues which were raised that you have not touched on and of course it is impossible for you to do so, and doubtless these matters will be reflected in the report. But I think one particular measure that might bear mentioning is the fact th at it was the s uggestion of the Finance Committee, and endorsed by a number of candidates, that under no circumstances should other members be called upon to compensate for withholding actions by another country. Whether the decisions we take here have implicit or explicit commitments in that direction I think is important to know. LE PRESIDENT: Je me permettrai d'intervenir sur deux points. En premier lieu, je n'ai pas dit la totalit\u00e9 mais la quasi-totalit\u00e9 qui a insist\u00e9 pour que le PCT... Cela veut dire que quelques membres n'ont pas a ccept\u00e9, cinq ou six. Le de quasi-totalit\u00e9 ne veut pas dire totalit\u00e9: par cons\u00e9quent je maintiens que j'ai dit: la quasi-totalit\u00e9. En ce qui le nous devrons parler de cette volont\u00e9 Conseil totalit\u00e9. Dans r\u00e9daction, peut bien d'inconv\u00e9nient. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I will not take the time of the Council for more than a moment or two, however I thought I should underline the support of the Australian delegation for the comment made by the United Kingdom. I do not think this gives rise, as 1 read the mood of the Council, to any difficulty. I suggested yesterday that such a study be done, so I think my assessment is correct. Concerning the comments made by Canada, and your response, Mr. Chairman, and relating to your summing up, I note what you say but I still feel that: 1 must underline again that the Austelinn delegation, as everybody knows, is one that has some misgivings about the proposals of the Director-General. We would certainly be hoping, expecting, that a balanced view be seen when the report of the Drafting Committee be put forward. I note the comments that you made in response to Canada, and 1 thank you for that. LE PRESIDENT: Nous souscrivons \u00e0 la proposition Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): En primer lugar, deseo se\u00f1alar que ciertamente muchos o la totalidad de los delegados de este Consejo escucharon las palabras pronunciadas por algunas delegaciones en relaci\u00f3n a un estudio que se supon\u00eda hab\u00edan hecho, pero este Consejo no puede darse por enterado de la existencia de tal estudio en vista de que no es un documento oficial que se hab\u00eda presentado y no podemos emitir consejo ni recomendaci\u00f3n alguna al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas para que haga tales o cuales evaluaciones o an\u00e1lisis. La recomendaci\u00f3n hecha por la Secretar\u00eda nos satisface en el sentido de que la delegaci\u00f3n interesada en discutir esos temas lo haga con la Secretar\u00eda, de manera que posteriormente y a propuesta hecha por tal delegaci\u00f3n, o algunas otras, en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas ese Comit\u00e9 estudie tal asunto en un momento posterior; pero este Consejo no puede reconocer que tal cuesti\u00f3n, no incluida en el programa y calendario de los trabajos de este Consejo, fue tratada. Y quiero ser muy claro porque hubo varias delegaciones que as\u00ed se pronunciaron; debemos atenernos a las reglas en los debates de este Consejo. Por otra parte, nosotros deseamos agradecer a usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, el resumen que ha hecho de las distintas cuestiones; nos parece ponderado, claro y sint\u00e9tico, ciertamente, y debemos subrayarlo. Tal resumen no impone ninguna obligaci\u00f3n al Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n para utilizarlo en su totalidad o en parte; es solamente una indicaci\u00f3n, una orientaci\u00f3n que a todos nos ayuda porque nos permite ver la forma en que usted refleja los debates aqu\u00ed llevados. Nos parece, y le agradecemos a usted, justas las aclaraciones en relaci\u00f3n a la forma en que ponder\u00f3 usted las declaraciones hechas por los diversos delegados en relaci\u00f3n a la discusi\u00f3n y las consideraciones del paquete puesto en el documento CL 90/23 en relaci\u00f3n a medidas posteriores que podr\u00edan evaluarse en el Consejo de junio, e igualmente al apoyo de la casi totalidad de las delegaciones concedido al PCT. . Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Despu\u00e9s de haber o\u00eddo a nuestro colega y amigo L\u00f3pez Por tillo, de M\u00e9xico, casi nos abstenemos de intervenir porque estamos plenamente de acuerdo con \u00e9l, pero ya que hab\u00edamos solicitado la palabra queremos utilizar esta ocasi\u00f3n para descargarnos de una inquietud que no es transcendental porque tal vez es de orden social. Ayer en la ma\u00f1ana, en la primera intervenci\u00f3n del distinguido delegado del Reino Unido estuvimos muy agradecidos porque \u00e9l nos aclar\u00f3 de qu\u00e9 se trataba el contenido de un sobre que encontramos el lunes en la tarde en el casillero de nuestra delegaci\u00f3n. Era un texto en ingl\u00e9s, idioma que no conozco, trabajo orgullosamente en mi propio castellano. S\u00f3lo alcanc\u00e9 a distinguir dos nombres propios: el del Sr. Deare, mi gran amigo y colega representante del Reino Unido en Roma, y el del Sr. Shah, distinguido funcionario de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Tal vez por la prisa con que abr\u00ed el sobre y porque, repito, no entiendo ese idioma, cre\u00ed que se trataba de una invitaci\u00f3n, de un acto social, de un coktail que el Sr. Deare quer\u00eda ofrecer a su cuasi compatriota el Sr. Shah como reconoc imiento a la competencia, a la capacidad y a la inteligencia del Sr. Shah. Pas\u00e9 a la segunda p\u00e0gina del sobre y encontr\u00e9 unos cuadros y unas rayas y pens\u00e9 que eran las indicaciones, el mapa, el plano para llegar hasta el sitio donde los colegas brit\u00e1nicos agasajar\u00edan al Sr. Shah. Para hablar seriamente creo que hechos como \u00e9ste constituyen pr ecedentes desafortunados. Ya hoy el Reino Unido, tal vez un poco alertado por nuestro silencio, lleg\u00f3 a proponer que ese documento se convirtiera en un documento del Consejo. Creemos que esto no es aceptable. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tal si en el futuro cada delegaci\u00f3n distribuyera aqu\u00ed documentos propios en chino, en \u00e1rabe, en indio, en bengales\u00ed, por ejemplo? Ahora, nadie puede desconocer el derecho de cada delegaci\u00f3n de hacer conocer su punto de vista a la Secretar\u00eda. El Director General recibir\u00e1 el documento que el Reino Unido envi\u00f3 al Sr. Shah, podr\u00e1 analizarlo, considerar si algunos elementos merecen ser tra mitados al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, pero que no se nos distribuya un documento de cada propia delegaci\u00f3n en un idioma que, repetimos, no es el nuestro y no corresponde a la pr\u00e1ctica de distribuci\u00f3n de los documentos en esta Organizaci\u00f3n. -194- Sobre su resumen, ya el colega de M\u00e9xico explic\u00f3 claramente el car\u00e1cter de orientaci\u00f3n, que no es vinculante. Usted dijo varias veces \"la gran mayor\u00eda\" esperamos que esto se refleje en el proyecto de informe que el Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n presentar\u00eda a la Plenaria y, una vez m\u00e1s, al colega del Reino Unido que no nos vuelva a mandar documentos en ingl\u00e9s. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): Just for the sake of clarity, although, I have not actually asked, and would not be so bold as to ask, that a paper by the United Kingdom should be considered by the Finance Committee, I should ask that the subject be taken up by the Finance Committee. I have offered a paper if the Finance Committee would like it. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I am very sorry to ask for the floor again. However, for the second time in four days I confess myself to be a little puzzled with what is happening here. Am I to take it that it is not possible for the Council to note a suggestion that a delegation makes in the course of the discussion? I felt that the United Kingdom suggestion was based on a genuine concern. It was not in any way destructive in its intent. I would have thought it would be quite in order for the Council to note in its report that this was raised and it is something which may be pursued. If we could carry this to its extreme it seems to me that when we look at the report of the Drafting Committee we will have to look very closely at a number of things which are not on the agenda in specific terms. Personally, I should have regarded these things be raised because they are relevant to the discussion and could be reflected as Council notes-\"The Council was informed\" that sort of formula. Am I to take it that indication such as the United Kingdom have given cannot be reflected in the report 87, il en Mais il faut \u00e9videmment le quoi voulez-vous discuter? M. Deare M. les mesures long Financed by Extra-Budgetary Funds on the basis Budget avons M. prochain de ce s'agit-il? Celui du Royaume-Uni tel qu'il est, ou un document nouveau qui sera pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en janvier, ou, selon la pratique nouveau \u00e0 (United Kingdom): I think there are two stories to this. One is the simpler one, which is that our interventions on another Agenda item-which is not 12 (b) today but would be 11 I think-would make more sense to delegates if they actually had before them the paper which we have already circulated. That is the end of that story. The second story is that we would like to have the subject of programme delivery costs taken up, as it is part of its normal responsibility, by the Finance Committee in the spring. We offer towards that consideration a paper. That paper would be a paper we would prepare, which might well draw upon this paper but would be after further discussions with Mr Shah. That paper docs not yet exist. To go back to my other story, the other paper I suggest might be distributed in such a way that n obody would object on the grounds that they have not seen it. I suggest it could be issued as a Conference Room paper if this is the way of operation of the Organization that people prefer. DIRECTOR-GENERAL: What do you wish to discuss under Item 11? R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): In my Agenda, Item 11 is described as \"Reports of the Fifty-Seventh and Fifty- Eighth Sessions of the Finance Committee. \" There is a se parate item, 11. la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni pour le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni? R. G. The title be Delivery de questions concernant le rapport Comit\u00e9 financier. nature de ces questions? R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): There were other points arising from the Finance Committee Report which did not seem relevant to the discussion under Item 12, \"Financial Matters\". It may well be there is no call for discussion under Item 11, and rather than waste people's time we will work out with the Secretariat under which Agenda Item it is best that we make the particular points that we have to make. But the issue of whether we may offer the paper as a CRP remains. -196- LE DIRECTEUR GENERAL: Nous sommes et arabe. C'est une faut du de d\u00e9cider. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Repe timos que no hemos podido leer el documento porque est\u00e1 escrito s\u00f3lo en ingl\u00e9s, pero ante la insistencia de nuestros colegas del Reino Unido y conociendo el car\u00e1cter pragm\u00e1tico y el \u00e1nimo constructivo que les anima, siempre pensamos que, sin duda, ellos est\u00e1n inspirados en un deseo de servicio, de contribuir al mejor funcionamiento de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n, Por ello, a la luz de lo que se acaba de decir y que yo hab\u00eda ya insinuado tambi\u00e9n de paso, el hecho de que s\u00f3lo existe un texto en ingl\u00e9s, no puede ser as\u00ed considerado como documento oficial. Creo que la situaci\u00f3n es muy ciara, Sr. Presidente, y que podemos estar de acuerdo en lo siguiente: en el tema de la agenda en el cual el delegado del Reino Unido podr\u00e1 referirse a su propio documento y dar todas las explicaciones que \u00e9l considere convenientes porque est\u00e1 en su derecho, pero que no se distribuya el documento. Luego, en el documento aparecer\u00e1 lo que se considere necesario y el Director General, a la luz de la discusi\u00f3n de los miembros del Consejo, juzgar\u00e1 si es oportuno o no dar traslado a algunos de esos elementos a la reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas de la primavera de 1987. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): We are inclined to go along with the recommendations of the representative of Colombia. We are impressed by the determination with which the United Kingdom representative wishes to place on record certain reservations regarding the overheads of FAO, but I thought that right at the beginning you had taken a decision, Mr. Chairman, that it was not to be a Conference document. I feel, rather than this matter being raised again and again under some other issue or some other head, it would be best to decide now as to how it should be dealt with. Secondly, in the Finance Committee, which has distinguished representatives and also the representative of Australia, I think various reservations or opinions could have been expressed and can again be expressed. I think this matter should be decided strictly according ruling, rather than continuing a discussion on a matter which has really lasted too long. Mrs MillicentM. FENWICK (United States of America): We are not just inclined to a ccept the recommendation of Colombia. We say for heaven's sake let us accept it and get on. We should have finished this long ago, and so we heartily endorse what the delegate has said. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I am not pushing this further. If the interventions we make do not make sense without our paper, we apologize. LE PRESIDENT: Si le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni du va faire \u00e9tat de tous \u00e9l\u00e9ments du rapport qui l'int\u00e9resse. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): S\u00ed, y yo creo que es hora de terminar este debate y pasar al tema siguiente. -197- b) Alternative Approaches to Dealing with Budgetary and b) Les incertitudes budg\u00e9taires et financi\u00e8res: approches possibles b) Alternativas para afrontar las incertidumbres presupuestarias y financieras LE PRESIDENT: Nous pouvons maintenant document CL examen notre travail, allons demander \u00e0 M. Shah de bien vouloir pr\u00e9senter ce document. V. J. SHAH (Director, Office of Programme, Budget and Evaluation): It is my pleasure again to introduce this Item on behalf of the Director-General. The financial liquidity problems which we are having to face in this biennium it is clear will be with us for some time. Therefore, this Item on your Agenda is as important as the one with which you have just dealt relating to the Programme of Work and Budget essence, we are dealing with to survive in order to accomplish the objectives set by the Member Nations and to fulfill the tasks for which you look to FAO. The document submitted to you, document CL 90/24, proposes a number of measures which are for your preliminary consideration-and I emphasise that. The Council need not take any decision on any of them, but its guidance to the Finance Committee and the Director-General, in his own view, is crucial for the formulation of such measures as he may wish to consider in due course and eventually submit to the Conference. I do not wish to repeat what is in the document. On the contrary, permit me to convey the Director-General's assessment of the likely future problems that we shall have to deal with as he sees them. In so doing, we do not need to indulge in any fanciful futurism. The Director-General has asked me only to share with you as soberly as possible his assessment of key factors and indicate where his assessment logically leads him. There of policy the legislation adopted by measures to deal with shortfalls in income; and thirdly, measures to deal with exchange fluctuations. I will myself, of facts. Firstly, legislative action in the case of the largest contributor. Here, may I be permitted to refer by name to the largest contributor without any disrespect, for it will make the consideration of the matter much easier. There are four issues I wish to comment on here. Firstly, the Kassebaum amendment. This Section Authorization Act, Public Law 99/93, limits US payment to the United Nations an d Specialized Agencies to 20 percent of their budgets, unless the soberly reflects dissatisfaction with these the process. This would amount to a Charter amendment in the case of the United Nations and in our case our Constitution. The present General Assembly has not yet consented to envisage such changes. The legislation seems and our logic would lead us to conclude that we face its effects indefinitely. Certainly, there visible move basis of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, Public Law 99/177, when requires that the total U. S. Federal budget deficit be reduced to zero over the next five years. It is striking that this law requires the Federal budget deficit to be brought down to $144 billion fo r the fiscal year 1987 yet, it seems that the present estimates, which we are aware of, would be of a deficit of a much higher figure-perhaps, some $200 billion. This measure can only to continue, but to increase in the intensity of its application. Thirdly, we face the action taken at the time of the annual preparation. It appears to us that the application of the two pieces of legislation, to which I have just referred, is intensified by measures which increase our di amount was appropriated for contributions to international organizations for the fiscal year 1987, one third of that amount, that is to say $130 million, is frozen until Oc tober 1987. Moreover, provision prohibits the funds in this appropriation from being used to pay the U. S. share of interest costs and loans to stated, shortfa lls short-term cash we effects of resulting lower contributions than could be expected. The payment due to FAO by the major contributor for 1986 is $50. 1 million, fifty million seventy five thousands to be correct. We have still not been officially notified, as was confirmed yesterday by the distinguished representative of the U. S., of when and what amount we will r eceive this year. However, as you are aware we have to monitor the situation and make the best estimates that we can with the best intelligence and the best information that is available to us. According to this preliminary and unofficial information, we understand that the payment this year may be only $5 million. We understand that we may be favoured with an other twenty million in Octobe r 1987. 1 s till refer to the 1986 contribution. How can we make any estimate of what we will r eceive against the 1987 contribution? Our logic would lead us that the foreseeable future the largest contributor does not appear to be likely, or will not be in a position, to meet its obligation to our Organization. According to our Rules and Regulations, these contributions will represent outstanding There is nothing said or guaranteed about whether, or when or how these arrears will be settled. We now expect the arrears from this contribu tor to amount to some $67 million for this biennium, three million more that the figure that was indicated in document CL 90/20. At this rate we may reach a level of some $135 million in contributions due from the Member Nation in three years time. This reduction in our resources evidently creates such of the Programme of Work and Budget approved by the Conference. But what of the future? One conclusion would be to have a Programme of Work and Budget which is dictated and determined by the level of payments we can expect to receive from one or other Member Nation. Is this what our Member Nations want? The answer w ill have to be given by the Conference. The Conference will have to consider measures to deal with the prospects which threaten the very survival of our strong Organization. Let me now deal with those matters relating to budgetary income shortfalls. our budgetary income, increasing beyond anything we have experienced so far, leads the Director-General to suggest that a number of measures are needed to strengthen or to sustain even our viability. How can a Working Capital Fund of just over $13 million cope with delays an d shortfalls in contributions five and ten times that amount? How can we continue to provide for miscellaneous income when world interest rates plunged to reduce it to half the provision that we were able to make? How can we deal with obligatio ns of some $60 million in early 1988 and have contributions outstanding of one and half time that amount? The third set of factors are the exchange rate effects. We used to think that our Special Reserve Account was a very safe device to deal with exchange rate fluctuations. There was no problem when exchange rates moved in our favour and led to a surplus of almost $14 million in 1982-83 and a million in 1982-83 and a surplus of $10 million in 1984-85, ail of which we nt into the cash surplus. However, the Lire/dollar rate has fallen by 20 percent since our Programme of Work and Budget was approved by the Conference at this rate. As Council will have -199- noted from the documentation the Special Reserve Accoun t of $22 million will be moved by the end of the biennium, if not before. These are the hard facts, the brutal reality and the sad prospects, (mind-boggling prospects) which we have to face. The Director-General is convinced that the Member Nations of this Organization want the Organization not only to survive but to continue as a solid and a valuable and effective organization. If the difficulties we now confront are unexpectedly severe and unprecendentedly severe, then the measures for our survival w ill have to be correspondingly brought into their concept and in their scope. The Conference will be called upon to take measures of foresight and wisdom. The Director-General is certain that the discussion in this Council will help the Finance Committee and help him in formulating specific proposals in accordance with your wishes and will help the Conference in eventually taking the necessary action. Le PRESIDENT: Je remercie son expos\u00e9. Nous la autour financi\u00e8re de Vanrob ISARANKURA (Thailand): May I start by thanking Mr Shah for his introduction to this important item. I have carefully studied all alternative approaches for dealing with budgetary and financial uncertainties as indicated in the document CL 90/24. Before we express our view on these approaches I would like to thank the Director-General for his efforts to find the ways and means to solve the budgetary and financial uncertainties and problems of our organization. He has proposed to us several solutions which may provide a reasonable assurance that the programme and budget which was decided upon by the FAO Conference can be protected. Regarding possible alternative approaches now under our consideration my delegation is of the opinion that only the first two alternative approaches can be feasible, namely amending present procedures for application of cash surplus and adjusting the treatment of miscellaneous income. If we are going to amend financial regulations as mentioned in paragraphs 13 and 15 delegation thinks it should not harm the member countries since it does not require extra contribution from the government and it will not cause an y problem of budgeting of member nations whereas propose Finance Committee or the Director-General should make further study on the two alternate approaches which I have mentioned. I would like to conclude that we could accept the fact. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I propose to deal with the proposal for possible alternative approaches in the order set out in paper CL 90/24 and will give my comments as was agreed this morning on the proposals for dealing with delayed payments separately at the end of this intervention. I was grateful for Mr Shah's presentation on the question of the problem arising from the withholding of the United States subscription. I do not propose to comment substantially on this since the paper CL 90/24 is not dealing specifically or particularly with this problem and the measures in it, of course, do not meet it at all. The answer is either that the United States pays up or that we reduce our expenditure to meet the realistically likely receipts. To revert to the paper, starting with paragraph 10, we cannot agree to the termination arrangements set out in Financial Regulation 6.1 for automatic distribution of cash surpluses. We have, of course, no objection to the voluntary surrender of a country's surplus if such suits the financial situation of that country. -200- There are precedents for this. In the case of UNESCO in 1985 and the delegate of Italy has raised the possibility from the point of view of his government in helping the present situation in FAO, income, again I am afraid we not agree to this. It would involve the acquisition by FAO a reserve, should be consciously voted by the relevant governing body. As regards the suggestion that the level of the Working Capital Fund should be assessed against the passage of expenditure and receipts ignoring the special complications brought default of the largest contributor. Such withholding for which, in a sense, has been given should be treated as shortfalls for which anticipatory action must be taken. Still on the subject of the Working Capital Fund comparison with other organizations may be helpful, but to check the validity of our findings. They cannot be a determining factor and they may be misleading if the purposes to which the Working Capital Fund may be properly put if the organizations concerned are not properly understood. For instance, UNIDO is quoted as an organization with a working capital fund proportionately higher than that of the FAO. In fact, the actual level agreed at the Conference, rather than the maximum level was $6 million and not $9 million and was about three weeks expenditure, actually very much the same as FAO and in UNIDO the working capital fund also has to deal with currency fluctuations for which FAO has other arrangements. It is true the Industrial Development Board recently increased the Working Capital Fund to its maximum of $9 million but this was because of the increased costs in the programme in dollar terms resulting from the change of the rate of exchange between the dollar and the Austrian schilling. When adequate and specific arrangements for currency been agreed in UNIDO the working capital fund is likely to be reduced again to some three weeks expenditure. 1 speak at length on this point because there is a danger of simple comparisons, as perhaps we have learned before in this meeting. Now as regards the proposal for the budget to be set annually, we would not wish to see the delegation from the Conference to the Council which this proposal would seem to involve. We prefer the other suggestions which involve the continued control by the senior body. We see no objection to further work being carried out by expressing the budget in a basket of and perhaps attitude here reflects our increasing dealings community. However, this is not our preferred arrangement. This is the appropriation of budget in two parts, one in dollars and one in lira, with assessments in both currencies. We do hope that unfamiliarity an not immediately about workability. is the arrangement which has r ecently been started by the International Atomic Energy Authority. The Director-General of UNIDO who has a budget which is perhaps more similar to ours than the IAEA's has indicated ecently that a preferred arrangement as as that preferred by a majority of member countries and is likely to be adopted at the March meeting of the UNIDO body, which is looking at this issue. I suggest that the difficulties mentioned in paragraph 24 of the paper CL be overcome; expenditure in currencies other than dollars and lira would to be allocated to other to whether the concerned tends the other European currencies and for most countries contributions are made in a currency which fluctuates against our own and it should be no real problem to provide contributions in two currencies. Now as to the sugge stion of an amendment to the Basic Text budgets except emergency purposes, we constitution drawn up more r ecently, for instance, that of UNIDO, that had provision for supplementary budgets without the requirement for it to be an emergency. We would not see any fundamental objection to modification of the Basic Text but these would need to be as envisaged in the constitution of UNIDO, handled in the normal way by the Council and Conference. We would see objections to the delegation of this responsibility to the Council alone. -23- Finally, and this is a different subject now, I turn to the suggestions We have doubts whether any of the proposals will have any significant the pattern of receipts but s uggested would be more equitable than those in force at present. My delegation considers the separation of the treatment of interest income has practical problems in its application and we would prefer one of the rather similar solutions II or VII set out in Appendix C. A. Daniel WEYGANDT (United States of America): Before I address the subject of the various alternatives proposed in document CL 90/24 I would like to respond very briefly to some of the comments made by Mr Shah in his introduction. My delegation appreciates the fact that the Secretariat is by no means underestimating the seriousness of the situation that we in here. However, I would like to emphasize, as I stated before, that the United States delegation has not been in a position to consult with the Secretariat on the level of the contributions. Therefore we can neither confirm nor take issue with the estimate made by the Secretariat. The position of my delegation is perhaps somewhat more optimistic with rese pct to 1987 th an that outlined by Mr Shah, but as we noted before, this is really in the realms of speculation at this point. So let me turn then to the proposal in document CL 90/24. It is the basic position of the United States that it would be inappropriate for the Council to make any definitive or final recommendations at this time bearing in mind that at least with respect to my government this document was only received the working day before the Council began which did not allow adequate time for analysis of the document whose proposals, all of which have some sw eeeping modifications and financial implications. We would also like to support what was said by the previous speaker that we are reluctant to see a delegation of authority from the Conference to the Council and we feel that if the issue should be considered in any fashion they should be postponed until at least the June Council. In fact the preliminary observations of my government are that with perhaps the exception of the fourth alternative which would be to set the budget rate, the exchange rate we would any alternatives proposed and I would like simply to put on record at this point we would simply like to see these issues developed and have a fuller discussion on the basis of a further analysis Khalil M AKKAWI (Lebanon): My delegation would like first to thank the Director-General for sub mitting this matter for preliminary discussion in the Council. We also thank Mr Shah for the excellent presentation and the explanation which we have just heard from him on this subject. We recognize that no decision is required from the Council now. We agree that Director-General on possible measures which might be examined in greater depth and formulated, for the eventual consideration of the Council and the Conference. It is abundantly clear that the measures which are presently available to our Organization are no longer adequate to deal with the budgetary and financial uncertainties of the scale which we are now witnessing. What is more paradoxical than to have to face a financial crisis during this biennium while at the same time a cash surplus of US $30. 7 million from the la st biennium will be distributed to Member Nations on 1 January -24- What striking than the that the miscellaneous income may expect to earn during biennium will be some million less than that estimated in the Progra mme of Work and Budget for 1986/87 because the Organization, like all others, is at the mercy of interest rates? What is more glaring than the fact that the Working Capital Fund of FAO as a percentage of the budget level is half that of any comparable organization in the UN system? All these factors indicate clearly that we need this mechanism and envisage additional mechanisms to protect this Organization and its programmes from the violent and unforseeable financial fluctuations which we are increasingly required to face. If strengthened and additional mechanisms need a greater commitment from Member Nations and a willingness to bear the additional burden involved, we for our part are prepared to do so and we are certain that all who care for this Organization will be equally prepared. We therefore urge the Council unanimously Director-General to develop and submit his proposals to the Finance Committee at its Spring sessi on in 1987 so th at we may consider what needs to be done at our own session in June and submit them to the Conference in November. John GLISTRUP (Denmark): On this subject my Denmark. I start by thanking Mr Shah for his introduction. I must say that I admire the way he is able in a very clear and concise manner to explain complicated matters. He does it so well that even I think that 1 understand the issues better after his introduction. In the Nordic statements on agenda item 12. 1(a) it was emphasized that there is an urgent need for having a current and conscious priority FAO's a issue, regardless of whether there is a net increase or a net decrease in the flow of resources. This fact should not over-shadowed will elaborate further on setting in Reports the Programme Committee. our on proposals contained in document CL 90/24. These comments are to advise the Finance Committee in their further deliberations on this matter. We find the number and variety of ideas put forward a bit confusing and would have preferred more coherent proposals for a believe that if clearer structures of priority setting in FAO had been developed, then a more convincing set of solutions could have been put forward. In general, the Nordic countries are opposed to any amendment of the financial regulations entailing a transfer of power from the Governing Bodies to the Director-General, as suggested in two exceptions, therefore, the Nordic countries cannot give support to the ideas contained in document CL 90/24. In particular we cannot accept the proposed amendment of present procedures for application of the cash surplus. Let me add in this context that we still do not have sufficient information on the composition of the cash deposits, in particular on the degree of liquidity of these accounts. Without that information we are not in a position to endorse the proposal to borrow some $30 million in order to cover shor t-term needs. However, the Nordic countries do see some merit in the proposal pertaining to the Working Capital Fund and to establishing a basket of currency rates. In common they may the process of channelling to FAO. -25- As to the Working Capital Fund, we realise that in order to support the General Fund we find some merit in the argument that the level of the Working Capital Fund is to low in relation to the budget, especially when comparing it with other UN agencies. Since we have many times argued for consistency within the UN system, we are willing to give the proposal in that direction further consideration. The second proposal which in our opinion helps to solve some of the problems concerning the uncertainty of exchange rates is to use a basket of currency when preparing the budget. This kind of solution is already known in other areas, like ECU in the European Speaking of longer term problems, I feel there also is a need for improving the financial transparency within FAO. It was interesting to listen to the bilateral exchange of views between the United Kingdom and the Secretariat. The Secretariat showed through Mr Shah that it possesses a wealth of information not contained in our documentation. The Secretariat should, on its own initiative, provide such information. That would be a sign of good management which in turn would help member countries and the Secretariat to avoid the occurrence of some short-term problems in the future. It could save time for the benefit of a constructive dialogue on the more long-term issues which we discuss.

Indeed, we believe that the measures proposed by the Director-General and endorsed yesterday by-to use your words, Mr Chairman-the quasi-totality of members of our Council, will bring us almost safely to the end of the present biennium. What will happen then, is the big question. The role of Casandra is not a pleasant one but preferable to acting like an ostrich, burying its head in the sand in the face of a threat. The hard bitter facts and prospects are there. Uncertainties are more likely to continue than the other way around. Mr Shah, in his presentation yesterday, confirmed, with his customary clarity, the worst of our affairs. The central cause of our financial difficulties and the main issue for the medium, if not longer-term future of our organization, will remain the uncertainty about the status of the United States assessed contribution. His explanation about the effects of the two United States legislation, explanations confirming what we already knew about them and by the United States delegation, to a certaain extent, leave no doubt about what will happen in the next years. If no new developments occur it is likely that the FAO, together with the rest of the United Nations institutions, can only expect to receive a fraction of the United States contribution in the foreseeable future. The fluidity of the situation is compounded by the fact that the United States legislation does not imply that the United States will not honour their obligations. The United States do not say that they will not pay their dues on the basis of assessed contributions. They just say they will withhold a large part of the payment of these contributions until the time when certain conditions will be fulfilled. We do not know precisely how and when these will be fulfilled. We are in the face of a grave dilema. When the next pr ogramme and budget will be indeed the member be in the paradoxical position of either assuming that the United States will pay its full contribution and determine the scope and expenditures of the programme and field activities on this basis, or they will have to elaborate a programme and budget that would take into account the foreseeable shortfall in the United States payments. In the first case the programme and budget will be most certainly a lame one and it is inevitable that not only programme \"adjustments\" but drastic cuts will have to be made, perhaps leading to the complete transformation of the programme In itially agreed upon. and use Mr Shah's words, will be a farce. As to the second case, we do not see how the member countries, other than the United States, will be able to a ccept the de facto revision of the burdening share which the rules set so long ago. At least I am pretty sure that the Turkish -209- Parliament and the Government will not. For the same reason that we would not be able to agree with a de facto reassessment of contributions, we do not think it is advisable to resort to further heavy borrowing, in addition to the borrowing which the Director-General may have recourse to at the end of this biennium, further borrowing, as I was saying, to offset the shortfall in the United States contributions. This will have the same results of increasing other members obligations in addition to risking the financial health of the organization. In any case, this question will clearly constitute the main concern of our next Conference. Furthermore, even at that time we do not believe that the FAO will be able to find isolated solutions independent from the United Nations system as a whole, unless, of course, the present situation changes. In essence, we fear that the medium and longer-term crisis of the United States will not remain simply a financial one but is liable to acquire political proportions affecting the whole set of international relations. We confess, at this point in time, and especially in view of the uncertainties besetting the future, that we are not in a position to venture even a guess on the possible solution, or on the probable shape of things in the years after 1987. Ve can only launch a plea to the largest contributors and, in particular, to the United States public opinion and legislative organs trying to inherent dangers of undermining multilateralism for world peace and security. The day before yesterday the United States delegate, in his very reasonable intervention, mentioned, as a possible approach, the support by all nations of the reforms proposed by the Group of 18 in the hope, or at least that is what we understood, that if these reforms are adopted and implemented the United States attitude would change and the crisis would be overcome. Firstly, we hope that this is not an \"or as\" position. It is not easy to prejudge the decision of 160 nations. We are sure that these proposals will be carefully studied and debated. For one, my country will give the utmost attention to them. However, a short time prospective. Moreover, even if we supposed they are inmediat ely put into effect it appears that this will not take care of the domestic budgetary co nsiderations of the United States. What w ill happen in the meantime? Shall the whole of the United Nations institutions withhold their programmes and budgets In the next years, or will they survive only through heavy borrowing, jeopardizing the soundness of the collapse of the whole system? We want to believe that this is not, that this cannot be the wish of the United States. Hence our appeal to them. An appeal meant exactly in Fenwick. views on the central issue of the financial difficulties of the FAO and the United Nations system in the medium and the longer term, we should make it clear that our analysis in no way implies every UN institution, including FAO, should not seek solutions, with at least a view to alleviating, to some extent, the impact of the b udgetary and financial un certainties facing them. That is why we welcome the initiative of the Director-General to prepare and present alternative approaches related to this issue. This step is another proof of his foresight and managerial capabilities. We could not, unfortunately, study these proposals indepth so as to be able to give our detailed and effective response to them. In any case we understand that these proposals are meant rather to initiate a discussion on the basis of which more comprehensive proposals will be presented. At first glance, these alternative approaches, as a whole, to contributions form the the organization. Again, inevitably, their positive effects depend on the fate of these For example, the proposals related to the cash surplus can only serve a purpose if there is a cash surplus. Moreover, as it is pointed out in paragraph 14 this measure will only transform an actual implementation in an ongoing Simila rly, suggested solutions relating to miscellaneous income may not mean much in the face of the drastic drop in the level of this income related to the shortfall in the revenues. As to the set of alternative proposals, aimed at alleviating the effects of exchange rates fluctuations, they will be of a certain help, but we need a closer look to be able to assess their implications. Having said Director-General's move and study of the following proposals. Amending present procedures for application of cash surplus. Increasing the level of the working capital fund and using a budgetary unit based on a basket of currencies. We expect that the Finance Committee, in its next session, will pro ceed to an extensive review of these proposals, and others, so that our Council will be seized with a more comprehensive and detailed package at its summer meeting. Finally, before concluding, please allow me to make a few brief remarks on the question of what we can call \"efficiency\" raised by certain delegations yesterday and the day programme delivery refrained from commenting on these subjects, because we believe that a debate on such matters was clearly out of order since the short term financial difficulties of the organization have nothig to do with efficiency problems. You made the same judgements in your summing up. -210- We are not facing a managerial crisis, but a financial one caused by the withholding of contributions by the largest contributors. On the contrary, we think that our organization can claim to be one of the most efficient institutions within the United Nations system. Now that we are discussing a longer-term perspective we are still of the opinion that the question of efficiency does not fit well into our agenda since we continue to deal with a cash flow problem rather than managerial issues. We do not see how possible to continue discussing it in a fruitful manner, but since there have been so many allusione to the subject and since you ruled yesterday that these matters may be discussed further, we deemed it opportune to state once and for all the position of our delegation, in a very few words without however wishing to rekindle the debate. As I stated earlier we are convinced that FAO is an efficient, and one of the best managed, institutions of the United Nations, if not the best. We share, of course, the idea that any organization can be further improved. However, we believe that this is a continuous process requiring the full concertation and even osmosis of the member countries and the Secretariat. The increasing improvements in the management and the efficiency of the FAO in the past years proves that here in FAO we are progressing in the right direction. My delegation is convinced that this progress should and will continue. In this, the responsibility should be shared between both the Secretariat and the members. FAO should certainly make extra efforts to deliver more with the same or even less resources and it is striving to do so but the members also should be able to give better guidance adapted to the circumstances. For instance, we believe that in the question of priorities of the Organization, members have a certain responsibility. It is up to the members more than the Secretariat to agree on the priority programmes and projects which after all are addressed to the member countries. We cannot expect Dr the myriad, the thousands the countries for project studies, etc. It is up to us to sift or screen our requirements and make proposals within the possibilities of the Organization, especially in these times of financial difficulties. What I am suggesting here is a clos er consultation between member countries before tabling proposals. To sum up, delegation fully ready to contribute to the process of increasing the efficiency of the Organization thinking at the same time that this on-going process can be more fruitfully served than this present occasion, any case by strictly observing the procedures established by our Organization. Ugo SESSI (Italie): de remercier M.

Mais je dois faire remarquer que, par le du Comit\u00e9 financier. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): As I believe the delegate of the United States said yesterday, the issue that faces us under this item has cropped up quite suddenly and the paper that has been prepared and introduced by Mr Shah has not been with us that long. Therefore I think our discussion of this item must be preliminary, and of course I think it was the Secretariat's intention to see these items discussed at length Committees and at subsequent Councils and indeed perhaps within the framework of the Programme of Work and Budget. Nevertheless, there have been some very thoughtful interventions made on this item, and I think particularly of the statement made yesterday by the delegate of Denmark on behalf of the Nordic countries and the very thoughtful statement we had even this morning from the delegate Italy. Given the very legitimate concerns expressed by virtually all Members of Council at the crisis that is facing our Organization, it would seem only wise that we begin to note such lessons as may be derived from it, and although our notes at this stage can only be preliminary, it occurs to us that there are a number of distinct elements for consideration. The first of these is what caused our problem and why. Is there something that has prompted our largest contributor to contemplate withholding a substantial its assessed contribution? If so, are there responses that we as an organization can give that would improve the situation? This question is of course in large part rhetorical, although we have a feeling that there are some thoughts and some pieces of the puzzle known to a few of us in this room. The second element is to devise methods to increase the financial certainty. In this we have to thank the Director-General for document CL 90/24, which stimulates our his presence of mind in seizing an opportunity from our present adversity by proposing four measures, namely the application of cash surplus, the treatment of miscellaneous income, the level of the Working Capital Fund, and prospects for supplementary budgets that would increase the Organization's access financial resources. Our government will of course give each of these due and mature study with a view to commenting on them more substantivelly at future meetings. To be fair, however, we should inform Council that our first impressions of these four s uggestions are not entirely positive, and for the following reasons. First, there are some short-term but substantive costs with each reflected in increased Member Country assessments at a time when virtually all of us are looking to the multilateral institutions for austerity measures. Secondly, the increase in resources available to the Secretariat and the quasi automaticity in access to these funds would substantively enhance the independence of the management judgment. This would exacerbate by a significant problem. Thirdly, we feel the ready access to new sources of money would significantly reduce the incentive and/or the of organizations to seek economies and to tailor programmes or operations down to meet available resources. We see these three points as being major obstacles to the envisaged changes proposed by the Director-General to increase his access to resources. On the remaining three proposals, those dealing with the treatment of we have less hesitation in expressing our willingness to join with the Secretariat in looking at these particular proposals, or indeed others of a similar nature, designed to reduce the impact of adverse exchange rate variations. In this we hope expect that there are useful lessons to be learned from the experience of our sister agencies in the Common System. We believe that organizations must unfortunately live with the resources available to them and not expect to be able to maintain programmes and activities when resources are not available to pay for them. Put another way, we very strongly feel that good management demands some priorization of programmes. Here I would like to apologize to my good friend the delegate of Turkey for deviating into an area which he has designated as inappropriate at this particular time. By priorization, of course, we mean some ranking of more important activities' to the lesser important so that when finances fall short of aspiration or expectation, then scarce resources can be devoted to the areas -213- most in need. We have been expousing this rather Calvinist gospel for some years in the FAO, as well as throughout the UN system as a whole, and we hope that incrementally it would find its way into the Programme of Work and Budget process. We do not pretend it is an easy process nor indeed a Secretariat, perhaps drawn in the first instance on the experience of other Agencies, on how such a process could be started. We have no brief for this particular suggestion, but one idea might be to start with a core budget-that is, the more essential elements of the programme and organization-which would occupy some 80 to 85 percent of the normal budget, to which could be added the 15 to 20 percent of desirable activities or programmes which would this idea have merit, the process in the fullness of time could become more sophisticated and various layers of programme added to this core budget. We do not pretend that this prop osal will or should solve all conceivable financial crises, but we do feel that something like it would very greatly complement proposals for financial certainty. There is another matter affecting the financial health of our organization, and particularly the Regular Programme, and that is the matter of cross subsidization by the Regular Programme of the Field Programme. This matter was referred to by the delegate of the United Kingdom when speaking of its in-depth look at delivery costs of the Organization. We believe that this useful study should be pursued in the Finance Committee or elsewhere, first to clearly establish the level of delivery costs, secondly to the prospects of reducing them, and ensure the to assist the Finance Committee and its Chairman, who I notice is not with us this morning, by returning to the matter rather confusingly called \"Measures Problems Assessed Contributions.\" This is a longstanding matter predating our present financial crisis and, as some delegates have pointed out quite rightly, it is a matter which will do little to help us in our present situation. Delegates will want to refer to paragraphs 22 to 31 of document CL 90/17, as well as to the Appendices and C at the end of that document. This matter appears to be very complex and indeed is regularly and repeatedly described as such by documents presented to the Finance Committee, the Council and the Conference over the last several years. In our view the issue is extremely simple. Our Organization is made up of members who pay their assessments in a full and timely fashion, many more members who pay late or only in part, and some members who do not pay at all. As the delegate of the Philippines clearly pointed out to us yesterday, there is a substantial opportunity cost here for the Organization in the form of lost interest earnings. Our present delay their period, thereby earning interest income and depriving the Organization of that income and still be rewarded with a pro-rata share of distributed cash surplus. It has long been than the system is unjust and should exists, should be distributed to members not only pro rata but weighted by the time and quantity in payment of assessed contributions. This apparently simple intention can be confused in a fog of complexity. In our view the matter can and should be settled quickly, and the appropriate amendments made should be ready approval in November 1987. To do less would imply that we are not only an organization of delinquent payers, but that it is in the interests of the majority to remain so. We, as a timely payer in the past, would have to draw some necessary conclusions from this. Therefore, we would like to suggest that this Council direct the Finance Committee (in the light of the work that they have done to date, and of the developments at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to come forward with a single proposal. we should also like to suggest th at the Committee on and Legal (if that is appropriate) prepare the consequent amendments to the financial regulations, and that these proposals, taken as a unit, be ready for Council in June 1987 and consequently for a ccepting by the Conference in November 1987\u00b7 Of course, we would be grataful for comments Secretariat this proposed schedule. Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): In relation to the suggestions by the Director-General for alternative approaches to assist in dealing with the financial crisis facing FAO (set out in document CL 90/24) we appreciate the opportunity to consider those proposals and to give our views on them. However, I should qualify my following remarks by saving that we have had little time to consider the proposals before the meeting of Council. Therefore, our views at to specific said on Wednesday under item 12. 1(a) of the Agenda, our general reaction is that Australia is not able to support solutions which are likely to result in contributors who have a good record of payment to FAO being asked to pay more for the purpose of filling the left by context, should underline that the proposals in document CL 90/24 did not seem to us to be in funds of $90- 100 million at the start of the 1988/89 biennium. We do not disagree that the existing mechanisms available to the Director-General may be inadequate to cope with this crisis. For that reason 1 must emphasize again that a major option which must be investigated is the setting of programme priorities which can be considered at the earliest opportunity, so that FAO does not enter the 1988/89 biennium faced with a shortfall of the magnitude described. Director-General's remarks yesterday afternoon that he understands the possibility that this may be n ecessary if the shortfall turns out to be of this magnitude. At the risk of labouring this point I can see only th ree possibilities emerging by th e end of the 1986/87 biennium. These are: (1) that the USA will pay a large part of its arrears in contributions. This appears most unlikely to us, unfortunately; (2) that other contributors will be prepared to make up a large part of the USA shortfall, or under other measures such as borrowings, so that the programme can be largely maintained. I have already said that we have difficulties on that score; or (3) that the Council or Conference a ccept the need for adjustments to the programme so that the expenditure of the Organization more closely matches the actual contributions received or likely to be received in the near future. What concerns Australia is that the last of these possibilities (the need for which we regret as much as any delegation here) is not being seriously addressed by a number of delegations to this Council meeting. I should like to digress a little here, with your indulgence, lest it he thought that Australia is being unreasonable uncaring with the problems of developing countries in urging a series of programme priorities. Let me draw the attention of Council to the fact that we have our own difficulties in Australia which make it very hard to maintain our levels of commitment to FAO and other international bodies. The current agricultural trade crisis has hit Australia very heavily. About 40 percent of our export income is derived from the agricultural sector. With the exception of New Zealand we are unique amongst developed countries in this respect. The commodity prices has had a severe effect on our balance payments and has contributed significantly to the dramatic devaluation of the Australian dollar which, in turn, has added to inflationary pressures. Our continuing problem is illustrated by the fact our inflation rate is now several times higher than our major trading partners. The level of international debt is at very high levels. In relation to farm incomes Australia is looking at a drop in the real net value of rural production of around 37 percent in just two years, leading to the underlying economic position of the farm sector being now the worst ever recorded in Australia. I have given this information to make the point that when we plead for the Council to address the financial crisis of FAO in a meaningful way (hard as I know that is for many delegations), Australia is not just being selfish and uncaring. We are merely trying to bring an air of reality to this discussion so that if the funds expected to be available when the current programme was agreed, are not fully available, then we can report back to Canberra that the Council of FAO is prepared to recognize the situation, and not just dismiss it as something which will somehow go away. If it does just go away, then Australia will be as happy as anyone here. Unfortunately however, I do not think that that will happen. I have said that we did not have the opportunity to look in any depth at the Director-General's proposals in document t suggestion, that is the elimination of the distribution of the cash surplus, and the second suggestion, removing the netting up of incomes, favourably inclined, for the reasons 1 gave earlier, as in an increase in countries' contributions. In relation to the third suggestion, increasing the leveL of working capital, we feel that further consideration needs to be given to what is an appropriate level of working capital should be, with references to what approaches are followed elsewhere and what the appropriate use of this fund should be. In relation to suggestions 4, 5 and 6, which all apply to the way exchange rates are applied to contributions, or exchange rate fluctuations are covered, we have not fully considered the implications at this stage. I would only observe that these measures would seem likely to have only a marginal effect on the overall financial problem. In any case exchange rate fluctuations being so unpredictable the net effect of these measures seem quite hard to assess. If the Finance Committee is to look further at these suggestions, I suggest there might be merit in also purchasing as an additional option. -215- On recommendation 7 we have no particular views this stage. Finally, I omitted to question borrowing by the Director-General, as a means of coping with the cash-flow problem which seems likely to exist by the end of the 1986/87 biennium. While acknowledging that this is a possibility under the regulations of the Organization, Australia would be strongly opposed to this course of action as a substitute to finding meaningful ways to fit the programme of work of FAO within the levels of contributions available to us. I should also like to add Australia's support to the general remarks of Canada on the payments of brought forward from the Finance Committee to Council in Ju ne 1987 and the Conference at the end of 1987. Eiichi KAWAHARA (Japan): The Japanese delegation wishes to express preliminary views at this stage. Regarding the alternative measures in the medium and long term touched upon in the document CL 90/24, for example, the establishment of a programme reserve, a change in treatment of miscellaneous incomes in the budget, and the increasing of working capital funds. I should like to ask what does it mean to us in the light of present circumstances? It seems impossible to carry out these measures without calling upon additional financial compensation from Member Nations who have duly implemented their obligations so far, because most people here want to keep to the present level of expenditure. Whereas, there is a continuing major uncertainty on the scale of income resources from Member Nations. As with all the alternative measures, of varying degrees of importance, now briefly touched upon in the same document we have to consider carefully what are their implications to us based upon our own past experiences and the experiences of the other organizations within the United Nations system, on this aspect. However, because of late delivery of the document, the Japanese delegation does not wish to make further comments relying only on policies. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): First of all I should like to thank Mr Shah for his very clear introduction of the problem-how to deal with budgetary and financial uncertainties in the short and long-term of this Organization. The ideas contained in the document CL 90/24 dealing with the long-term approach are very interesting and could serve as a good basis for consideration by the Council at this stage, and by the Finance Committee next spring and probably by the Council next June and maybe the Conference itself. After the long experience that FAO has had in this field, and particularly during the years of strong volatility of exchange rates of currencies within which the FAO Programme of Work and Budget has been planned and executed, it is obvious that some measures are to be taken to ensure a more sound basis and to enable our Organization to work and execute its duties in more certain conditions than it has been able to do so far. we received the document dealing with possible alternative approaches only two days before the delegation left Belgrade. Therefore, we have had no time the matter and consult the government authorities concerned. For this reason my comments on the possible approaches will be very brief and of a preliminary nature. To make things short and clear I will avoid discussing the proposed possible approaches on which I am not quite certain, or where we have some doubts on their possibility or usefulness. That is why, again on a preliminary basis, I would express our positive thinking only on two basic elements in this paper. This is concerning paragraphs 17, 18 and 19 dealing with the necessity of increasing the level of the Working Capital Fund which is needed for normal and stable work of the Organization and to bring it to the relative level of other similar specialized agencies or organizations of the UN system. The second, on which we also have a positive opinion, is a very useful proposal to use a budgetary unit which be based on a basket of currencies. To be more specific, we think that the most convenient basket of currencies be that which is internationally and almost universally recognized, that is the Special Drawing Rights unit. We would not be in favour of making a new basket of currencies, two or more, or using units which are used for integration groupings. By using the basket unit of currencies or, as we prefer, the SDR unit, the Organization would be less dependent on only one or two currencies, the exchange rate of which are not always the result of monetary market and free exchanges but more often the result of national policies of the governments concerned which, on the other side, have brought macro economic consequences worldwide, including the international organizations and FAO itself. -216- While this Organization is independent and the governing bodies are sovereign to decide how it will method of budgeting the Secretariat should consult the other organizations within the UN system to see what are their problems, experiences and intentions in this field, so as to take them into account in making final proposals to the Finance Committee and to the governing bodies. Badr Jassim ALAWI (Iraq) (original language Arabic): First of all, I should like to thank you, Mr Chairman, for the great patience that you have shown in the way in which you have chaired this Session, because of course we want to reach recommendations which would be in the interest of all member countries of our Organization. I should also like to thank you for giving me the opportunity of commenting on document CL 90/24, but I would mention that we did get this document somewhat late. Over the past few days we have discussed a number of issues, studied the documents and Secretariat; we have heard what member countries have had to say regarding the financial statue of the Organization; similarly, we have heard what has said; and we have also heard directly from the Chairman of the Finance Committee. Recommendations have been made to avoid a more serious financial crisis. The situation witnessed by the Organization has several reasons. We have problems of arrears on the part of Member States and we have lowering interest rates; we have the drop in the exchange rate of the dollar against the lira. All of this is part of the crisis which we are now facing. Therefore, I should like to make a number of comments on the alternatives proposed in document CL 90/24. Regarding the cash surplus and paragraphs 10 to 13, I do not think this would solve the problem in members. This involve changing Article 6. 1 of the Financial Regulations, and I do not think we would be able to solve the problem in that way. We know that a General Confernce resolution in 1985 allows for the amendment of this article, however we do not see a negative aspect in maintaining it. Looking at paragraph 15 and 16, the amendment would have financial repercussions on a lot of member countries, this is why, in our view, financial Regulation 5. 2 should not be amended. I think we can look at the question of increasing the level of the Working Capital Fund. I believe that this would allow us to look into matters in more detail. This could allow the organization more flexibility in examining and settling financial problems in the future. Looking at paragraph 22, we do not believe that using a budgetary unit based on a basket of really solve the problem because the financial Organization particularly at this specific moment as do all because this the supplementary budgets, we disagree with that as well as we feel that that could well lead to financial confusion. However, looking at paragraph 26, what can be done is to give authority to the Council to use supplementary budgets when the need arises. Joseph TCHICAYA l'attention voulue le document CL excellemment pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Nous pr\u00e9occupations ce que susceptible Pour ce est concernant la fixation annuelle du taux de change budg\u00e9taire par semble une solution facile; et il est normal ce soient les pays en d\u00e9veloppement en ont un tr\u00e8s grand besoin et (Austria): First of all, I would like to thank Mr Shah for his introduction to the document before us. We all know that FAO is facing seriou s budgetary and financial problems as and so on. In view of the importance of the issues and the fact of the financial crisis which the Organization is facing, we believe that the proposals by the Director-General before us should be sent immediately to the Finance Committee. I am sure that members of the Finance Committee, and especially Ambassador Bukhari, will take notice of the comments of this Council in the course of the next meeting of the Finance Committee. The results of the discussion of the Finance Committee should be known to the Member Nations as soon as possible, so that we can discuss them during the Council meeting in June of next year to then decide the measures for follow up at the Conference. Rainer PRESTIEN (Germany, Federal Republic of): The document before us gives information on the causes which have led to the present unfavourable financial prospects of the Organization. Firstly, there is the possible shortfall in contributions by important caused changes in the exchange rate. In document CL 90/24 the Secretariat outlines a number of alternatives to solve budgetary and financ ial uncertainties with the aim of providing guidance to the Finance Committee and the Director-General should be studied more closely (paragraph 28)\u00b7 Our opinion of the document is that proposals submitted do not yet represent a suitable basis for discussion. We believe, that the complilation of possibilities for a greater financial security of the Organization must be orientated more specifically. to the problems to be solved. The document mentions a number of possibilities which do not however allow to see clearly enough in detail which specific problem is to be solved by which measures. First of all, we should get a better overview of the issues to be solved before starting to elaborate possibilities for solutions. We believe that the special session of the Finance Committee in D ecember should first attitude towards the second alternative approaches described in the document. In the first mentioned alternative (paragraph 10 of the document), we understand the amendment suggested a conversion of the cash surplus, so far repayable to Member States, into a non-repayable grant of Member States to the Organization. We have doubts insofar as the cash surplus to which Member States are entitled being made available to the Organization. In our opinion, Member -218- States are, in the last analysis, entitled to these shares. We, however, have no reservations if the Member Nations put their shares of the cash surplus at the disposal of the Organization on a voluntary basis, as proposed by the distinguished representative of the host country. In the second alternative it is not, in our view, one of the self-evident principles of budgets, to enter all income budget. also applies income we of that this income has also to be properly budgeted in the budget. In connection with the third alternative, paragraph 17, we consider that an increase in the working capital fund is less suited to solve the present difficulties. Fourthly, the possiblity of setting the b udget rate of exchange annually instead of biannually, it is in our opinion, a fundamental budget question. It should annual budget. This very short budget period does, however, not seem adequate to us. Fifthly, the proposal of budgeting on the basis of a basket of currencies (as reflected in paragraph 22) is, in our opinion, not aimed at the problem per se applies to the dollars and Italian lira. Sixthly, in our opinion the drawing up of a supplementary budget for the Organization is no means to present or possible later difficulties. The supplementary budget for the Organization could not be brought into line with the national budgets of Member States, because their budgets would adopted of FAO. We therefore propose to obviate financial risks for the Organization through the existing financial safety instruments and to abstain from its establishing new instruments. Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (original language Arabic): I would like to thank Mr Shah for his clear and excellent presentation of document CL 90/24. My delegation wishes to say that the possible approaches which have been proposed for solving the Organization's financial problems are approaches which we can accept. They w ill, in fact, enable the Organization to carry on its task for the benefit of all Member Nations. However, we do not accept the increase in annual contributions from Member States to the Budget. We should like, and hope, that the Council will be able to give the necessary guidelines for this to the Finance Committee to allow it to take the right decisions on this subject. Li DACHUN (China) (original language Chinese): My intervention will be brief concerning the long-term alternative to dealing with budgetary and financial uncertainties as proposed by the Director-General in his document CL 90/24. Due to the complexity of the proposals, we did not have sufficient time to study them thoroughly. However, we believe that the document has provided a sound basis for the deliberations of the Council. The Chinese delegation is prepared to consider any positive measures to deal with budge tary and financial certainties and uncertainties. I wish to make a few preliminary remarks regarding increasing the level of FAO's Working Capital Fund. In view of the fact that FAO has a low percentage of working capital funds in the total budget, as compared with other UN agencies, we agree to increasing as appropriate the level of FAO's Working Capital Fund. Regarding the treatment of the 1984/85 cash surplus, the Chinese delegation suggests that the FAO draw on the practice in ILO. Finally, we hope the Director-General and the Finance Committee will take into account all the comments made by the Council where they proposed concrete measures when dealing with the budgetary and financial uncertainties for consideration for the session of the Council in June 1987. Robbie Matongo MUPAWOSE (Zimbabwe): Allow me to this important item. Proposals in document CL 90/24, as we understand it, are as a result of FAO being forced to take possible action due the shortage conceded that the major input le due to non-payment by the largest contributor. Even if the contributions by other defaulters are as email as 5 percent, if that little bit was paid, it would help, and would also show a genuine willingness by all members to support our Organization. The majority of members present here have budgetary and deficit problems. We do not believe that individual national financial difficulties should be an excuse for not the majority of members here not paying at all. In introducing this document CL 90/24, Mr Shah made reference to some implied gymnastics contemplated by the largest donor. If there is truth in those references we can only say that could be a dangerous trend. The specific proposals need careful consideration and comments can only be preliminary. The proposal on procedures for application of cash can only be preliminary. The proposal on procedures for application of cash surpluses (item 10) does not -219- convince us to be a long-term solution. We do not, therefore, support it. There is some merit in the Finance Committee further examining a possible increase in the level of the working capital. We also believe the annual statement of the budget rates of exchange may be further examined. However, the authority of the Conference should be maintained and not diluted by delegation to the Council, let alone to the Director-General. Using the basket of currencies, even if it may not substantially improve the financial position of FAO, would be a positive move. The Finance Committee may be asked to examine this further and in some details. Use of the double currencies, that is dollar and lira, does not appeal to us. We would not like to see the budget reduced because we benefit from the assistance of FAO. However, if there are no funds because members do not want to meet their commitments, FAO will have little alternative but to reexa mine the budget, and if possible, to In the document tabled discussion seven alternative approaches have been proposed for consideration by the Council in order that the Council could provide some guidance to the Finance Committee and to the Director-General. I would submit that the first one dealing with present procedures for application to cash surpluses seem to have the effect of accumulating the funds with the FAO, without being applied to current contributions. This would possibly result in increased cash inflows the Conference to amend the Financial Regulation 6. 1. The second suggestion relating increase cash inflows. Only it seems to have some significance for tackling the ways and means position of the FAO, though this would also require a decision from the Conference to amend Financial Regulation 5. 2. a. The third suggestion for increasing the level of the Working Capital Fund does not increase the cash inflows though it increases the cash availability to the FAO. On this also the Conference has to take a decision. Coming to Item A, Setting the Budget Rate of Exchange Annu ally instead of Biennially, this does not in any way increase the cash inflows though it has certain positive and negative aspects, as mentioned in the document and here, it would also be necessary for the Conference to delegate its power to the Council. Item 5, Using a Budgetary Unit Based on a Basket of Currencies, does not effectively alter the cash inflows and the FAO itself has several reservations about the efficacy of this proposal. 6, with Contributions Partly in cash and FAO documents. I would submit that suggestions 4, 5 and 6 really have no direct bearing or relevance to the financial crunch, as it were, which we are facing. These are meant to tackle more the situation that is arising out of the fluctuations in the international currency exchange than the preparing and obtaining approval for financial budgets is really a procedural matter which does not again affect the Inflows: it only results in better financial and budgetary management so that the matching of funds and programmes can be more properly done. This also requires the delegation of powers from the Conference to the Council. To sum up, of the seven suggestions, two are not recommended by FAO Headquarters: these are Items 5 and 6. Of the remaining five, all require decisions by the Conference; one suggestion, No. 3, a decision only by the Conference. Two items, 1 and 2, decisions by the Conference followed by smendment of Regulations; and two items, Items 4 and 7, which require decisions by the Conference end also delegation of powers to the Council. Prima facie our approach to this problem would have to be finalised based on our assessment of the periods in the terms of a time to come for which we have to live with this problem. Do we envisage that this problem would last only for a year or two or, at the wors t, until November 1988? November once in every two years, as all of us know, is an important milestone in the democratic process of our largest contributing member. In that case do we expect the position to change for the better from the FAO's point of view by January 1989 and woul d also have a retroactive effect for the biennium 1986/87. If this is our appreciation we are only to contend with the ways and means problem which might last only for about 24 to 36 months. If, on the other hand, we expect this position not to alter significantly even af ter 1988, there can be only two possible alternatives. Firstly, if the levels of expenditure are to be kept up, to find way by which member countries would increase to cutbacks imposed by the single contributor. Secondly, in the alternative, to reduce and cutback the expenditure levels to match the total contributions which are expected to flow in from the member countries, particularly allowing for the reductions the single largest contributor. While dealing with the second alternative permit me to refer to two of the observations made by the delegate from Canada. He has referred to certain aspects of the puzzle relating to the reduction in the inflows from the single contributor and seemed to imply that some member countries know the answer to the puzzle. We for one are not privy to the solution to this puzzle. Secondly, the delegate from Canada also referred to a context of the possible reductions in the Budget. With due respect, may I submit that prioritisation has no specific relationship expenditure is an essential constituent and is indeed a sine qua non of all prudent financial management and budgetary exercises. If we take a hypothetical position and imagine for the moment that there is no financ ial crunch facing us, even then if it is a budget of $461 million or US $600 million, inevitably there are more demands for programmes competing in and excluded. Therefore I would submit that prioritisation is something that is normal and I am sure has been followed throughout by the FAO, which, as we have noted in the last few days, is an Organization into whose working prudent budgetary and financial management procedures are fully integrated. The present financial problem is applicable to the entire United Nations system. As you are aware, in the Government of India, besides the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, we have the External Affairs Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the Industrial Development Ministry which are concerned with various UN organizations. Since the Council is only being asked to provide guidance to the Finance Committee as to how and which of these approaches should merit further study, I would submit that after due in the Government of India with the concerned Ministries, we will advise our Ambassador to Rome and to the FAO who will convey our views to the Finance Committee and the Director-General\u00b7 Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): We have had final news from Washington in a cable which arrived this morning. The news is not very good, but at least it is very clear. The United States will send US$4, 800, 000 now and more later for a total of US$25, 400, 000 by October 1st 1987\u00b7 I would like to point out that the other United Nations organizations for which we also have a high regard, such as WHO and ILO, have received s imilar news from our country in the same identical cable this morning. I have spoken to the Director-General about this but I wanted to share the news as quickly as possible with my friends and colleagues here. Paul A. BOMANI (Tanzania): My delegation wishes to intervene on this Agenda Item, not because we have anything substantial or new to add to what has been stated but more because we feel the need to take this opportunity to register our views and seriously appeal to the major donor countries of FAO to reconsider their stand regarding the stop-gap measures intended to keep the Organization afloat. However much I do appreciate the arguments and reasons leading to some reservations by some member countries, I still feel that we have no viable alternative at present and if we do not go along with the recommendations made by the Finance Committee then we are rendering ourselves to a more myopic and chaotic situation, however short the duration of such situation may It is therefore my considered opinion that the well-thought out approaches recommended by the Finance Committee and what has been stated by a number of speakers here, and in particular the statement made by India just s moment ago, would be the only way to deal with this problem. I think we need to allow ourselves time to look very closely at the measures recommended and in the meanwhile we should go along with the stop-gap measures so that we do not bring the Organization to a grinding halt. la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation du CILSS.

Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Se\u00f1or Presidente, sin duda ya usted ha interpretado adecuadamente el sentimiento de todos los miembros del Consejo; sin embargo, la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia debe cumplir el honroso encargo de pronunciar unas breves palabras a nombre del President. del Grupo de Am\u00e9rica Latina y de el Caribe y de loe latinoamericanos que integramos este Consejo para manifestar nuestra complacencia por la presencia en este reuni\u00f3n de tan altos funcionarios representativos de loe honorables gobiernos de Africa que, con el excelent\u00edsimo senor Presidente de Senegal a la cabeza, est\u00e1n empe\u00f1ados tan tesoneramente en la noble tarea de hacer frente a la sequia y a las dem\u00e1s dificultades que vienen entorpeciendo el mejoramiento de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n en Africa y causando problemas de hambre y de malnutrici\u00f3n, que nosotros lamentamos muy de veras. Queremos simplemente decir que los latinoamericanos y del Caribe todos somos plenamente solidarios con nuestros hermanos de Africa en el Tercer Mundo, que apreciamos los esfuerzos que el Director -226- General de la FAO viene ofreciendo en favor de las aspiraciones, de las necesidades y de los derechos de los pueblos africanos y que pedimos a los distinguidos ministros africanos que hoy nos honran con su presencia que al regresar a sus pa\u00edses testimonien al Presidente del Senegal y a todo el pueblo africano la m\u00e1s plena solidaridad y el apoyo m\u00e1s sincero y entusiasta de todos los gobiernos y pueblos de Am\u00e9rica Latina y del Caribe.

Asuntos financieros, en particular : 12.1 Financial Position of the Organization including Measures to Deal with Problems le versement des contributions (suite) 12.1 Situaci\u00f3n financiera de la Organizaci\u00f3n, especialmente medidas para afrontar los problemas de retraso en el pago de las cuotas (continuaci\u00f3n) (b) Alternative Approaches to Dealing with Budgetary and Financial Uncertainties (continued) (b) Les incertitudes budg\u00e9taires et financi\u00e8res: approaches possibles (suite) (b) Alternativas para afrontar las incertldumbres presupuestarlas y financieras (continuaci\u00f3n) Sra. Mercedes FERM\u00cdN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Vamos a ser muy breves porque creeemos que es de nuestra responsabilidad decir unas palabras con relaci\u00f3n a los asuntos que est\u00e1n en discusi\u00f3n, y comenzaremos por decir que en relaci\u00f3n al documento que nos ocupa deberemos expresar nuestra satisfacci\u00f3n por su excelente presentaci\u00f3n y felicitar al se\u00f1or Shah, quien ha hecho un trabajo excelente. Nos referimos luego al contenido de las alternativas presentadas en el documento, las cuales, como ya varios delegados han expresado, deber\u00edan ser realmente objeto de un estudio profundo en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas para luego ir a los organismos que realmente corresponde en cuanto a tomar decisiones, es decir la Conferencia y-un Consejo especial en el caso de que esto ocurriera. Pero no quisi\u00e9ramos dejar pasar por alto el hecho de que en la intervenci\u00f3n del delegado de Canad\u00e1 se diga que hay que buscar las causas, y habl\u00f3 de prioridades jerarquizadas. En primer lugar, el concepto del delegado de Canad\u00e1 de que esta es una Organizaci\u00f3n de gente que paga, dicho as\u00ed textualmente, y que no puede ser una Organizaci\u00f3n de gente que no paga nos parece un criterio tan,-todav\u00eda la palabra \"pragm\u00e1tico\" es fina para calificarlo-, nos parece realmente, como dicen los italianos, un bruto criterio, porque \u00e9sta no es una Organizaci\u00f3n de gente que paga o no paga. Cuando nosotros escuchamos hablar y expresar el criterio con que el creador de la FAO, el hombre que di\u00d3 sus ideas-para la creaci\u00f3n de asta Organizaci\u00f3n, y cuando nosotros escuchamos en el d\u00eda de la Alimentaci\u00f3n y en las Conferencias de la FAO expresar los fines para los cuales la FAO fue creada, por ning\u00fan lado aparece el pragm\u00e1tico criterio de pagar o no pagar. Esta es una Organizaci\u00f3n para asistir a pa\u00edses necesitados en desarrollo y para pa\u00edses que est\u00e1n en el estadio de lo que se llama Tercer Mundo, que es el preeetadio de la situaci\u00f3n humana porque todav\u00eda no han podido alcanzar la condici\u00f3n de hombres y mujeres. libres, porque no pueden ser hombres y mujeres libres los que tienen necesidades, los que tienen hambre, los que no han podido llegar todav\u00eda a satisfacer sus necesidades m\u00e1s elementales de supervivencia, esa es la gente para la cual naci\u00f3 la FAO y con la finalidad de asistirlos-esto no es una empresa comercial en la cual se contribuye o se invierte para obtener beneficios-, y las personas, pa\u00edses u organizaciones que contribuyen a ella lo hacen con la finalidad de servicio, no de negocio. Por eso, pues, la expresi\u00f3n de pagar o no pagar est\u00e1 sobrando cuando hablamos en la FAO; por eso hablamos de \"contribuciones\". -227- Es cierto que tiene que haber prioridades, pero cuando fijamos estas prioridades \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el criterio?. \u00bfEs el criterio de que los organismos hayan pagado y no hay dinero o es el criterio de que hay necesidades que atender?. Acabamos de presenciar y de escuchar a este Ministro que ha llegado de muy lejos en donde nos ha demostrado c\u00f3mo la FAO ha sido verdaderamente la Organizaci\u00f3n que ha salvado del hambre a un conjunto de pa\u00edses del Africa Saheliana, y c\u00f3mo ha venido especialmente a agradecer la atenci\u00f3n con que la FAO acudi\u00f3 a prevenir esta peste de langostas y saltamontes que iba a afectar gravemente esos pa\u00edses que sal\u00edan por primera vez del hambre y que felizmente, seg\u00fan sus propias palabras, ha sido conjurada aunque sea temporalmente. Estos son hechos imprevistos a los cuales atiende la FAO, a los cuales debe atender la FAO, y si nosotros nos sujetamos de una manera r\u00edgida, rigurosa a estas prioridades jerarquizadas, situaciones como \u00e9sta se quedar\u00e1n porque no est\u00e1n en la jerarquizaci\u00f3n que se presume, que debe existir en la FAO, por eso no voy a entrar en la alternativa 1, 2, 6 3 porque creo que todas van a ser estudiadas en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas por gente con capacidad suficiente para decidir y por \u00e9so no entramos en estos pormenores; pensamos s\u00ed que esta es una situaci\u00f3n que no hay que resolverla con un criterio econ\u00f3mico y aqu\u00ed, me excusa el Se\u00f1or Presidente, aqui si hay que aplicar la Pol\u00edtica, con may\u00fascula, es decir aqu\u00e9llos criterios que establecen relaciones entre los hombres de acuerdo con sus necesidades, de acuerdo con sus capacidades sin que sean contabilizadas en d\u00f3lares o en ninguna cesta de monedas, sino sencillamente en capacidad de contribuir. Si nos atenemos a las prioridades que presumo yo tiene en su mente el delegado de Canad\u00e1 \u00bfcu\u00e1les ser\u00edan las que pertenecen a ese n\u00facleo de programas que \u00e9l considera primordiales?. Pues tendr\u00edamos que empezar por las m\u00e1s urgentes y esas m\u00e1s urgentes no tienen espera. Cuando el a\u00f1o pasado se nos dec\u00eda aqu\u00ed que en Etiop\u00eda estaban muriendo cien ni\u00f1os diariamente de hambre \u00bfqui\u00e9n hubiera podido estar pensando si habla que atenerse a las regulaciones espec\u00edficas que conceden o no conceden al Director General capacidad para pedir pr\u00e9stamo o para tomar el dinero de aqu\u00ed o de all\u00e1? Yo creo que debemos dejar en cierta manera a un lado el criterio de los negocios y de las inversiones cuando se trata de las operaciones de la FAO y atender entonces a los medios que podemos disponer para atender esas necesidades. Yo estoy de acuerdo con que los paises que tienen sus cuotas atrasadas deben hacer todo el esfuerzo posible por comenzar a ponerse al d\u00eda, y ya dije ayer mismo c\u00f3mo me dirigi a mi gobierno y estoy cumpliendo con ese criterio, sobre la necesidad de terminar de pagar la cuota de este a\u00f1o; pero los pa\u00edses que est\u00e1n un poco m\u00e1s atrasados podr\u00edan comenzar a hacerlo poco a poco de manera que en un per\u00edodo no muy distante la FAO pueda comenzar a vivir una situaci\u00f3n menos angustiosa de la que actualmente vive. Hemos recibido con benepl\u00e1cito, pienso yo, la informaci\u00f3n que nos da la distinguida embajadora de Estados Unidos con relaci\u00f3n a la decisi\u00f3n tomada por su pa\u00eds en cuanto a la contribuci\u00f3n de la FAO. Yo pienso que esto nos va a permitir que nosotros en la FAO, con todas las dificultades que esta crisis significa, vamos a colocarnos en una situaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s democr\u00e1tica, que ya no vamos a tener el \"principal pa\u00eds\", el miembro m\u00e1s importante, el miembro que da el tanto por ciento, vamos a ser ahora como una familia en donde el hijo mayor no tiene todos los privilegios, no vamos a tener derechos de primogenitura, pero si lo vamos a tener para contribuir, pero tampoco para pensar y pedir, varaos a llegar a una situaci\u00f3n de Igualdad que es la que establece el principio democr\u00e1tico y que entonces no vamos a reclamar esto ni lo otro porque somos el pa\u00eds que da m\u00e1s, sino que todos vamos a tener iguales derechos. Por esa raz\u00f3n yo, como felizmente no soy ni economista ni financista pero s\u00ed soy pol\u00edtica, puedo mirar esto con criterio pol\u00edtico, pero Politico con p may\u00fascula, no politiquero y entonces pensar que no vamos a colocarnos aqui en el Consejo de la FAO con otra posici\u00f3n y que todos en igualdad vamos a buscar, cada quien en la medida de sus fuerzas, la posibilidad de contribuir lo m\u00e1s que pueda a la salvaci\u00f3n de esta Organizaci\u00f3 n, que, sin duda, nadie lo ha puesto en duda, es \u00fatil, ha sido importa nte para los pa\u00edses que est\u00e1n en n ecesidades y tambi\u00e9n ha sido \u00fa til para aquellos pa\u00edses que teniendo excedentes que no saben d\u00f3nde colocarlos, gracias al Programa Mundial de Alimentos pueden colocar sus excedentes. Por esa raz\u00f3n yo pienso que todo no se ha perdido todav\u00eda para la FAO, tal vez soy ingenua, tal vez soy idealista, tal vez. soy ignorante de lo que es la econom\u00eda y loa juegos econ\u00f3micos. -228- Hablaba el Canad\u00e1 de que hay que comenzar a buscar las causas, por qu\u00e9 causas Estados Unidos reduce su contribuci\u00f3n. Lo ha dicho ya aqu\u00ed su delegado, porque ellos tienen problemas all\u00ed, pero si cada uno de nosotros nos ponemos a reducir la contribuci\u00f3n por los problemas que tenemos dentro, la situaci\u00f3n entonces es de cerrar el negocio e irse cada qui\u00e9n a su casa. Yo conf\u00edo en que esa no es la situaci\u00f3n, en que vamos a encontrar un camino, en que estas alternativas que presenta el Director General, bien estudiadas por el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, van a poder encontrar una posibilidad y que con la voluntad decidida de todos los pa\u00edses, por m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os que ellos sean, de cumplir con sus cuotas atrasadas para no tener que depender de un pa\u00eds, a lo mejor ese va a ser el comienzo y ejemplo de lo que todos nosotros so\u00f1amos, de que exista en nuestra humanidad un nuevo orden econ\u00f3mico internacional y la FAO comenzar\u00e1 por dar el ejemplo de c\u00f3mo va a funcionar ese nuevo orden econ\u00f3mico internacional, de igualdad, de gente que no tiene todos los poderes pero que posiblemente puedan resolver sus problemas entre ellos mismos. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Debemos reconocer que, despu\u00e9s de la declaraci\u00f3n que hicimos durante la discusi\u00f3n del primer punto relacionado con la crisis financiera, la situaci\u00f3n ha cambiado desfavorablemente. Desgraciadamente, se han confirmado las informaciones oficiosas que tenia el Director General sobre los niveles del pago de las contribuciones del primer contribuyente. Esta situaci\u00f3n nos preocupa profundamente. No obstante, por nuestra relativa comprensi\u00f3n realista que ya expresamos, no podemos imaginar que el futuro de una organizaci\u00f3n como la FAO va a seguir sometida a estas incertidumbres. Mi colega y amigo, el Vicepresidente Sr. Iskit, de Turqu\u00eda, plante\u00f3 en la primera intervenci\u00f3n de esta ma\u00f1ana un asunto que merece mucha atenci\u00f3n: las incertidumbres que pesar\u00e1n sobre el Director General en la preparaci\u00f3n del Programa de Labores y Presupuesto para el a\u00f1o 1988-89. \u00bfSe va a modificar la escala de contribuciones? \u00bfVamos de nuevo a incluir en ese presupuesto contribuciones semejantes a las del presente bienio para que luego afrontemos una situaci\u00f3n semejante en 1988-89? Esto nos inquieta sobre todo porque, como lo demostramos en la discusi\u00f3n del tema A, la situaci\u00f3n de la agricultura y de la alimentaci\u00f3n naturalmente en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo sigue siendo sombr\u00eda seg\u00fan los t\u00e9rminos que us\u00f3 anoche el distinguido colega de Australia en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Y ante ese hecho, no podemos consolarnos sencillamente con seguir lo que se haga en otros organismos de las Naciones Unidas. No debemos resignarnos a que es necesario someternos a las consideraciones de la crisis, sin asumir ac titudes que preserven el funcionamiento eficaz de esta Organizaci\u00f3n que (illegible) -230- LE PRESIDENT: Monsieur le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Yo ten\u00eda raz\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Presidente, cuando yo preguntaba por el resto no me refer\u00eda al a\u00f1o 1986, porque el presupuesto en la FAO no es anual. Me refer\u00eda al resto del bienio. A cu\u00e1ndo se va a pagar la totalidad de la contribuci\u00f3n del bienio, pero no prolonguemos el debate. The meeting rose at 12. 30 hours . La s\u00e9ance est lev\u00e9e \u00e0 12 h 30. Se levanta la sesi\u00f3n a las 12. 30 horas. - 229 - setenta en la que acu\u00f1anos como delegado de Colombia un slogan en el cual dec\u00edamos que en las Naciones Unidas la FAO era la organizaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s conservadora, la menos sensible a los cambios que se estaban cumpliendo en la comunidad internacional. La FAO era una organizaci\u00f3n anquilosada, se hac\u00edan muchos estudios, se adelantaban intensas actividades acad\u00e9micas, se produc\u00edan informes en idiomas que ni siguiera eran accesibles a la mayor\u00eda de los Estados Miembros de la Organizaci\u00f3n; la FAO no tenia representantes propios en los pa\u00edses, todo estaba concentrado en Roma; los consultores viajaban fugazmente a nuestros pa\u00edses, volv\u00edan r\u00e1pidos porque no hablaban nuestros idiomas y les hac\u00eda da\u00f1o nuestras comidas aut\u00f3ctonas; volv\u00edan a Roma, aqu\u00ed ocupaban sus flamantes escritorios y desde la capital de la cristianidad del mundo hac\u00edan recomendaciones sin conocer la realidad socioecon\u00f3mica del Tercer Mundo, recomendaciones te\u00f3ricas que obviamente no eran aplicables. Era la \u00e9poca tambi\u00e9n, Sr. Presidente, en que se vend\u00edan los proyectos aunque esos proyectos no correspondieran a las prioridades establecidas en los programas de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Era la \u00e9poca, Sr. Presidente, de la dolce vita : los bur\u00f3cratas internacionales invad\u00edan los bares y restaurantes con sus pipas humeantes en la boca y el peri\u00f3dico debajo del brazo; en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, progresivamente, de manera ordenada, seria, estricta, con pulso firme, pero sin trauma ni distorsiones todo ello ha venido cambiando favorablemente. Y debemos reconocer, Sr. Presidente, que estos cambios se han producido gracias tambi\u00e9n a los pa\u00edses desarrollados, a sus representantes que han aportado no s\u00f3lo sus contribuciones que son la base esencial del programa de la Organizaci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n sus ideas y sus iniciativas a trav\u00e9s de un excelente capital humano con quienes yo he compartido mis actividades en la FAO durante 27 a\u00f1os. Ahora se ha logrado una descentralizaci\u00f3n moderada, pero que ha permitido asegurar la presencia viva y actuante de la FAO en las regiones, particularmente por medio de los representantes en los pa\u00edses funcionarios propios de la FAO. Ahora, nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n responde con dinamismo y eficacia a las solicitudes de nuestros gobiernos. Se han agilizado los mecanismos para la identificaci\u00f3n, la preparaci\u00f3n y la ejecuci\u00f3n de los proyectos que ahora corresponden a las prioridades fijadas por los gobiernos. La imagen de la FAO se ha fortalecido en el contexto de las Naciones Unidas y los pa\u00edses beneficiarios recurren a ella con la seguridad de que se les asistir\u00e1 de manera pr\u00e1ctica y eficiente. Claro que volvemos a estar de nuevo relativamente de acuerdo con Canad\u00e1 y Australia en el hecho de que nada es perfecto, de que, si bien la FAO ha logrado progresos notables, a\u00fan se puede refinar algo m\u00e1s su eficacia y fortalecer el empe\u00f1o intenso del Director General porque la FAO sea cada vez m\u00e1s eficiente. Algunos pocos de quienes est\u00e1n en esta sala recordar\u00e1n al profesor franc\u00e9s Mich\u00e8le C\u00e9p\u00e8de, mi inmediato antecesor como Presidente independiente del Consejo de la FAO, cuyo retrato aparece al pie del m\u00edo, sobre la pared de la izquierda. Hace 27 a\u00f1os, Sr. Presidente, - algunos de los que est\u00e1n en esta sala no hab\u00edan nacido todav\u00eda - cuando yo comenzaba a ser un fogoso delegado colombiano, porque ese mal o esa virtud es cong\u00e9nita en mi temperamento, y yo criticaba acremente el funcionamiento de la FAO, el Profesor C\u00e9p\u00e8de me respond\u00eda: \"el gran estadista franc\u00e9s Leon Blum dec\u00eda: cuando me analizo a m\u00ed mismo, me desprecio; cuando me comparo con los dem\u00e1s, roe admiro.\" Esa cita concuerda con el hecho de que si la FAO trabaja excepelonalmente bien es cierto que a\u00fan puede ser susceptible de otras mejoras; esto se est\u00e1 logrando; nuestro colega Iskit de Turqu\u00eda, lo dijo muy bien esta ma\u00f1ana: ese proceso se seguir\u00e1 cumpliendo. Pero es obvio que en este Consejo no estamos en capacidad de profundizar debidamente en la consideraci\u00f3n de estos asuntos y, por ello, sabiamente quienes han venido construyendo los textos b\u00e1sicos de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n han asignado a nuestro Consejo organismos asesores importantes como los Comit\u00e9s de Programa y de Finanzas. Como conclusi\u00f3n de este debate, se consignar\u00e1 en el informe la opini\u00f3n del Consejo, todo ello pasar\u00e1 a los Comit\u00e9s del Programa y de Finanzas, nos reuniremos nuevamente en junio y debemos estar todos seguros de que la FAO se salvar\u00e1, de que unidos continuaremos aqu\u00ed a trabajar en un club, en una hermandad de sincera y fraternal cooperaci\u00f3n entre todos los representantes de todos los pa\u00edses sin distingos porque estoy seguro de que todos nos identificamos en el objetivo com\u00fan de que la FAO debe seguir al servicio del Tercer Mundo. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la Colombie de son apologie de l'Organisation. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I was not as clear as I hoped to be. The point is that US$4 800 00 will be paid now, pretty soon now. The remainder of the 1986 contributio n, which will when totalled amount to US$25 400 00, is frozen until October 1, 1987. In other words, although it is the 1986 contribution that I am talking about, apart from the US$4.8 million which is going to be paid now, the remainder, which will add up to a total of US$25.4 million as the figure for the year, is frozen until Oc tober 1, 1987. Now, this does not refer in any way to the 1987 contribu tion. We have no news on that. We do not know what it will be. - 230 - LE PRESIDENT: Monsieur le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la Colombie, Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Yo ten\u00eda raz\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Presidente, cuando yo preguntaba por el resto no me refer\u00eda al a\u00f1o 1986, porque el presupuesto en la FAO no es anual.

First let me congratulate Dr Shah for the very useful and constructive introduction of this item of the fully shares the Director-General's concern mentioned at paragraph 1 of document CL 90/24 about the budgetary and financial uncertainties at present being faced by FAO. All efforts should be made at this point to help him implement the main programmes of the Organization and as well to demonstrate that the spirit of real multilateralism is still alive. With few exceptions we have, however, listened to disturbing interventions of some the larger contributors to the FAO budget. While recognizing that the main problem today is the shortfall of payment by the larger contributors, some have to arrears, not showing much disposition to face the difficultie s and support the measures proposed by the Secretariat, and as well attempting to blame FAO's management for the present problems, with which we do not agree. It Is regrettable as well that the Organization and member countries, including the least developed ones, decision to withhold legal payments of the contribution by the leading world economy. We have been discussing for two days the financial crisis but we do not have precise elements to evaluate its impact and exact extension in the future stability of the Organization. -233- This morning it was confirmed that the amounts to be paid are the same, or almost the same, as foreseen by the Secretariat. We have now learned that up to next year the largest contributor will pay less than half of its legal The united States' intervention was not therefore too helpful. We still do not know what is going to be paid in relation to the 1987 contribution, no r what will be done with regard to arrears in the future. Taking into account the seriousness of this crisis, a crisis provoked by this most important shortfall, my delegation cannot see the relevance for the Finance Committee to keep up discussions of alternatives as presented in paragraph 31 of document CL 90/17 and its Appendix C, alternatives that do not contemplate the main problem now faced and that will the developing most affected by an unfavourable international environment. Our opposition is greater in relation to the Canadian proposal which would actually aggravate the situation without inducing honour its obligation. We recognize however that it is always easier to to their to the share of certain industrialized Members of this Organization. We position when discussing scales of resources drained to external debt and the protectionist measures that prevent the free flow of our products into developed markets render it difficult sometimes for us to pay in time our very high contributions to international organizations. It can be no surprise to us that among the ten largest debtors to FAO, in US dollars, not percentages, there are some developing countries, actually the main exporters of capital to the industrialized world today. What really surprises us is that today there are developed countries among these ten debtors and that the main debtor is the wealthiest nation in the world. The Secretariat knows that my government has never challenged our legal obligations, and has tried to do its best to reduce our arrears. I assure you further efforts will be made in this regard. Most of the alternative approaches presented by the document CL 90/24 have implications on the rate and amount of actual resources to be disbursed by member countries. In this respect my delegation believes that the Secretariat could have provided us with more precise information on their direct impact in terms of US dollars on our contributions. However, we are assured that elements will be presented later for deeper discussion. On this point my delegation wishes to state, in a very preliminary way, that we look forward to additional and in-depth studies and discussions on each presented. If it is possible to reach a consensus in this Council we would be prepared to support the non-distribution of the cash surplus and exceptions, are not ready to give a good example of their commitment to multilateral organizations. We would be prepared by consensus to support the amendments proposed to the financial regulations which would leave no room for doubts about the transitory nature of the measures which would be revoked when FAO's financial situation improved. We are still prepared to support the increase in the level of the Working Capital Fund, which has already proved to be insufficient to support the general fund and should be increased to the level of other agencies. However, we have doubts as to Italian or a currency based on a basket of currencies. We are not prepared at this moment to support budgets not restricted to emergency expenditure. Antonio Albertino AFONSO DIAS. montre combien la situation, vis-\u00e0-vis de l'Organisation, n'est pas contributeurs. En les pays en d\u00e9veloppement. Ce sont les le mien, qui plus (Egypt) (original language Arabic): I asked for the floor only to inform the Council that I have received today a letter saying that Egypt has transferred its annual contribution to the b udget of the Organization. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): Deseo agradecer a nombre de M\u00e9xico al Doctor Shah por la presentaci\u00f3n de este tema. La delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico agradece al Director General la forma cautelosa y eficiente como administra los recursos de esta Organizaci\u00f3n. Ello ha evitado que las perspectivas que hoy enfrentamos sean m\u00e1s negativas. La FAO hubiera podido hacer frente a todos los inconvenientes financieros menos, como se ha hecho ver, a la decisi\u00f3n unilateral del principal contribuyente. Por eso queremos que quede constancia en las actas y en nuestro informe de la responsabilidad directa de ese pa\u00eds, del principal contribuyente, en el sensible debilitamiento de la FAO y su transcendental funci\u00f3n en beneficio de la humanidad. Repetimos, esta decisi\u00f3n de no pagar la totalidad de la contribuci\u00f3n la consideramos un error hist\u00f3rico que todos los pueblos del mundo sabemos sancionar\u00e1n. La situaci\u00f3n futura es ambigua e incierta, como qued\u00f3 claro hoy en la ma\u00f1ana, en vista de que no podemos saber cu\u00e1nto y cu\u00e1ndo pagar\u00e1 aquel pa\u00eds de lo que resta de su contribuci\u00f3n bianual. Frente a esa situaci\u00f3n nos pronunciamos en contra de que se imponga un castigo m\u00e1s severo a la ejecuci\u00f3n del Programa de Labores y Presupuesto aprobado para este bienio. Esto no implica, se\u00f1or Presidente, que estemos de acuerdo en conducir a la FAO a una situaci\u00f3n financiera inmanejable. Por el contrario, nos obliga a hacer un ejercicio serio, maduro y, sobre todo, oportuno, en el que respetemos prioridades; pero como ya varios delegados lo han cuestionado \u00bfqui\u00e9nes y c\u00f3mo se interpretan esas prioridades? Esta es una Organizaci\u00f3n orientada a la asistencia y apoyo al desarrollo agr\u00edcola y alimentario y al logro de la seguridad alimentaria mundial. Esas son las prioridades que por lo menos la gran mayor\u00eda de los Estados Miembros reconocemos. Y esas prioridades, como lo ha escuchado usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, por parte de la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses aqu\u00ed representados, se plasman fundamentalmente en el PCT y en otros programas ligados a la seguridad alimentaria. Debemos, por supuesto, propugnar por mayor eficiencia, pero no al extremo de que \u00e9sta afecte la eficacia, es decir la capacidad de cumplimiento de metas en FAO. Deseo aclarar tambi\u00e9n que no podemos aceptar que para resolver los problemas financieros de FAO y de las Naciones Unidas en general debamos aceptar los objetivos de cambio estructural que busca imponer el principal contribuyente y otros pa\u00edses. Ello ser\u00eda tanto como reconocer que \u00e9se y otros pa\u00edses tienen prevalencia sobre los intereses de la mayor\u00eda de los Estados Miembros que estamos representados en condiciones de igualdad. M\u00e9xico reafirma los principios de objetivos de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n y defiende su Constituci\u00f3n; es mas, mantendremos vivos y vigentes esos principios y objetivos antes de ceder a cualquier tipo de condicionamiento. En la escala de cuotas que se aplica a los miembros de FAO resulta que hay un contribuyente mayor, pero tambi\u00e9n que hay pa\u00edses en desarrollo ahora con grave crisis financiera, como nos lo han recor -235- dado varios delegados, que pagan m\u00e1s que varios pa\u00edses industrializados. Esta Organizaci\u00f3n, por tanto, no es de quien paga, y menos de quien paga m\u00e1s; la humanidad no pertenece a los poderosos, sino los poderosos a la humanidad. En este contexto, y ante la incertidumbre de largo plazo, me remito al p\u00e1rrafo 28 del documento CL 90/24 donde se indica claramente que el ejercicio que ahora hacemos y en relaci\u00f3n a las siete propuestas es preliminar y deber\u00e1 profundizarse concienzudamente en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. Agradezco, por tanto, al Director General de que act\u00fae con prudencia y que no nos haya presentado un paquete de p\u00e1nico y de desmoralizaci\u00f3n, sino una estrategia flexible que ir\u00e1 adecuando a la certidumbre financiera que se conozca en el futuro. Por eso quiero concluir observando que las siete propuestas nos resultan interesantes y dignas de que el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas las estudie a fondo; por. lo pronto, no queremos emitir nuestra opini\u00f3n detallada respecto de cada una de ellas. Asimismo queremos expresar que reconocemos que el Director General tiene facultad para contratar empr\u00e9stitos de corto plazo aunque subrayamos nuestra opini\u00f3n de que esa debe ser una opci\u00f3n de \u00faltima instancia. El Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas se reunir\u00e1 dos v eces por lo menos hasta que este Consejo vuelva a encontrarse. Estoy seguro que ah\u00ed se tratar\u00e1n con responsabilidad y profundidad las propuestas hechas aqu\u00ed y otras que respondan a las exigencias. Pedimos al Director General que nos mantenga informados de toda novedad y que podamos conocer con toda antelaci\u00f3n la confirmaci\u00f3n o proposici\u00f3n de nuevas decisiones para emitir nuestro juicio razonado con toda calma. Terminamos haciendo un llamado a todos los pa\u00edses a que cubran sus pagos lo m\u00e1s pronto posible y a todos los miembros de esta Organizaci\u00f3n a que fortalezcan con altruismo el esp\u00edritu y los cauces del multilat\u00e9ralismo. LE PRESIDENT: Nous arrivons a la fin ces to the various proposals put forward in the document that we have just been discussing. Many comments have been made on each of the various options. There has been a wide range of opinion, some for, some against. As might have been expected, reactions have been extremely mixed. I would suggest that it is not n ecessary for the Council to strive to reach any consensus at this stage on which these various options should be pursued. I would suggest that when the Finance Committee meets, in just over three weeks time, we should look with the Finance Committee at the verbatim records of this discussion and take into account the many points of view that have been expressed when we take a decision as to whether any, or all, of these options should be studied in depth. That would be only a procedural discussion the Finance Committee in mid-D ecember. A substantive of is felt desirable to pursue would then go to the Finance Committee when it meets again in May. In case any doubts remain, I should like to emphasize that these options are long-term measures to tackle long-term problems. There is no thought in our minds, and I hope not in the minds of any -236- delegations, that these various options are going to solve the critical situation which we face in the rest of this biennium, and certainly at the beginning of the next biennium. What we are looking at are the possible ways to minimize or avoid a recurrence of such problems and on such a magnitude on future occasions. As for the short-term critical situation both in this biennium and more particularly at the start of the next biennium, there have been a number of comments made, in the debate, by delegations commenting upon the options in this document. These comments too will be useful when the Finance Committee meets. The perceptions of the financial short and medium-term crisis are still evolving. As the Council is well aware, we only had the final offical figures from our largest contributor this morning. When Committee meets in ecember perhaps some aspects little clearer. I should like to emphasize that these are not problems that are special to FAO. They are affecting virtually all organizations in the UN system. Of course, we shall be working extremely closely with other participants, other members, other organizations in the UN system as we attempt to tackle the crisis that confronts us. I have nothing further to add on the options for long term solutions, but there was one specific question put to the Secretariat by the Representative of Canada. It related to the measures put forward by the Finance Committee in paragraphs 22 to 31 of its Second Report, document CL 90/17, where a series of alternatives are suggested for the handling of the cash surplus at the end of a biennium essentially with a view to rewarding the virtuous and not the virtuous and the sinners equally. The Canadian suggestion was that the Finance Committee's conclusions on these matters be referred to the CCLM for the drafting of an appropriate modification in the Financial Regulation concerned and that from there the matter go to the Council and the Conference. He requested the comments of the Secretariat, and I can only say that in logic and procedure-wise this certainly is correct; this would be the way to handle the matter. However, the question of substance reverts to the Finance Committee and it will be for the Finance Committee to decide whether the guidance given to it by the Council is sufficient to narrow down the alternatives which have been put forward in its report and to come up with a narrower range in the form of perhaps taken de ses \u00e9claircissements. Ce qui \u00e0 ce stade faire la attend le Comit\u00e9 financier sur ce point pr\u00e9cis, le 16 d \u00e9cembre, est Je la possibilit\u00e9 question d'\u00e9clairer par la suite le Conseil sur les incidences de ces mesures - et surtout sur les tenants, les aboutissants et les applications au George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): Mr Chairman, I did just want to thank the Deputy Director-General for his response to our question. I quite agree with what he has said, but there is one slight qualification. I had asked that the Finance Committee be charged with selecting a single proposal from amongst the three preferred alternatives they have suggested and in the light of the action taken by the International Civil Aviation Organization, so in a sense there are four options that I have suggested might be us efully considered by the Finance Committee, and insofar as the Finance Committee is the best qualified, most expert, and would have the ability to make that choice, they could choose one of those and then follow on with the CCLM and the presentation to Council. I would hesitate to leave the point on the grounds that there may not be sufficient guidance and therefore the Finance Committee is unable to take such action, so I wonder if that could be included in the summing up. Secondly, the Deputy Director-General's suggestions are very wise indeed about the seven proposals that have been put forward by the Director-General in the sense that the Finance Committee might usefully take a look at those to decide which, if any, would merit further study at subsequent meetings. I wonder if I could also ask that the additional two proposals which we have put forward in this regard might be taken into consideration by the Committee so that there were not just seven put forward by the Secretariat but at least others derived from the discussion. I think the problem of between the Regular. Programme and the Field Programme; secondly, the prospect that there could be a priority or core budgeting involved as a longer term measure to address financial stringency. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Yo reitero mi impresi\u00f3n sincera expresada ya en varias oportunidades en el sentido de que considero que todas las delegaciones que se est\u00e1n preocupando por proponer soluciones concretas est\u00e1n inspiradas en el mejor de los deseos. Sin embargo, nos preocupa que a este tema se le pretenda dar una situaci\u00f3n particular algo excepcional. Yo creo que la consideraci\u00f3n de este tema debe ser como la de todos los dem\u00e1s: reflejar en el informe el sentido de las discusiones y, naturalmente, el informe del Consejo contendr\u00e1 aquellas orientaciones para su organismo asesor que es el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. No quisiera que en el informe del Consejo trat\u00e1ramos de encerrar en una camisa de fuerza ciertas propuestas o ciertas actividades. En dos ocasiones hoy mi distinguido colega y amigo Musgrove de Canad\u00e1 ha hablado de algo que ha pasado en la Organizaci\u00f3n de la Aviaci\u00f3n Civil. No tengo idea de qu\u00e9 se trata; mi vecino de la derecha tampoco lo sabe y por eso estamos preocupados, estamos aqu\u00ed en tierra y no sabemos lo que esta pasando en esa organizaci\u00f3n, si \u00e9l nos ilustra un poco, o a trav\u00e9s de sus declaraciones transmita a la Secretar\u00eda esa informaci\u00f3n fuera del curso normal de cada tema. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): My good friend the not having read his documents, but there is a report of the Finance Committee, document CL 90/17, and in Annex B to that report there is a description of the process that has been adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. It is a matter that has been reviewed by the Finance Committee to some extent, but only in a very cursory sense, but now that the matter has been adopted by ICAO it is an example of what has happened in the UN international system. We are not necessarily an advocate of it; we are only suggesting that they have take n a look at it in a cursory sense; it is described in a cursory form in the document before us, and perhaps it is worth a second look. Chavaly SRINIVASA SASTRY (India): I am speaking with specific the point made by the delegate of Canada. He has suggested that in the summing up of the disc ussion it should specifically be mentioned that the two suggestions th at they made, in addition to the seven contained in the documentation to this Council meeting, and also something else that occurred in another UN-associated body, should be considered by Committee. If heard the Deputy Director-General correctly, when he was summing up he did say that the verbatim reports of the discussions in the Council along with the documentation would be placed before the Finance Committee. Therefore, all -238- dealing with a situation which is changing very rapidly and which is dynamic. It is therefore conceivable that between now and the next meeting of the Finance Committee, some other steps might have been thought about in UN organizations and bodies. Surely all this relevant information will be placed before the Finance Committee by the FAO Head-quarters Secretariat. Therefore, with due respect I would submit that would be appropriate nor the summing up to name any suggestions made by any delegation during de notre ordre du jour, si vous en convenez. III. ACTIVITES OF FAO AND WFP III. ACTIVITES DE LA FA O ET DU PAM III. ACTIVIDADES DE LA FAO Y DEL PMA 8. Recent Developments in the UN System of Interest to FA O 8. Faits nouveaux survenus dans le syst\u00e8me des Nations Unies et int\u00e9ressant la FA O 8. Novedades recientes registradas en el sistema de las Naciones Unidas de inter\u00e9s para la FA O 8. 1 Review of Recent Developments 8. 1 Examen des faits nouveaux 8. 1 Examen de las novedades recientes A. REGNIER (Director, Office for Inter-Agency Affairs): It gives me great pleasure to introduce Council the agenda item entitled \"R ecent Developments in the UN System of Interest to FAOM. The document before you is CL 90/12 which attempts to review the most recent developments. Of course, the document does not cover those items which are considered elsewhere in the agenda of the Council, for example agenda item 8.2 concerning Africa and its related documents which will be introduced later on. Throughout 1986 FAO has continued to cooperate fully with the other organizations of the United Nations system in the inter-secretariat machinery established under the aegis of the Administrative Committee on Coordination. For example, at the October session of ACC the executive heads had a full exchange of views on the social and human impact of structural adjustment policies and on a proposal by the Director-General it was decided that the matter should be pursued and discussed further by the ACC Task Force on Longer-Term Development. FAO has continued to provide leadership for the United Nations system in its chairmanship of the Task Force on Rural Development, as well as its significant role in the ACC Sub-Committee on Nutrition. This ensures a close of effort among the organizations the system, particularly a time when member governments are devoting more attention to the efficiency of the system and the optimum use of its resources. In view of the fact that the document before you is rather exhaustive and was prepared recently, and includes matters up to September of this year, there are only a few further developments on which I would like to report at this time. These include developments in the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Annual Meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the launching of the Uruguay round of the GATT and the preparations for UNCTAD VII. Among the many issues before the General Assembly at this session, I should like to draw to the attention of this Council two Resolutions which have been approved by the Assembly on the recommendation of the Second Committee. The first resolution deals with the fight against the locust and grasshopper infestation in Africa. Recognizing the important work achieved by the Global Information and Early Warning System of FAO, it urges this Organization to strengthen its coordinating mechanisms and its technical and field -239- operational support for locust and grasshopper control. It requests the Secretary-General, in close consultation with the Director-General of FAO, to take catalytic action in raising the consciousness of the world community regarding this potentially disasterous situation and invites the Director-General of FAO to report on the locust and grasshopper infestation to the Economic and Social Council at its summer session of 1987. The second resolution concerns the emergency situation in Africa and deals with the follow-up to the work of the Office for Emergency Operations. I should like to bring to your attention that hereto the role of FAO with regard to the early warning systems is fully recognized in the resolution. As you may know the Secretary-General has announced separately new arrangements for the follow-up to the Office for Emergency Operations which closed at the end of October. These new arrangements are defined to ensure that the experience gained in responding to the recent drought-related emergency in Africa is preserved, and to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to respond to future emergencies in a timely, effective and The Secretary-General has designated for Emergencies in Africa, who will also serve, at the same time, as Director of the office of UNDRO in New York. FAO will continue to cooperate closely with this mechanism and to respond quickly and effectively in the areas of its mandate and competence. I should also like to men tion the 1986 Un ited Nations Pledging Conference for Development Activit\u00edes, which took place in New York on 13 and 14 November. For UNDP, 90 countries pledged a total of million, estimates for additional pledges of $208 Total UNDP sources would ex ceed $800 million, the history, and 4 percen t higher than the actual 1986 fund ing level. For UNICEF, 79 governments pledge d $170 and for UNFPA, ple dged $100 million. The annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund stressed the need for coordination of international economic and co-responsibility were seen as essential to stimulating non-inflationary growth, in order to make progress on the debt problem and in order to improve functioning international monetary system. Structural to be untenable in the absence of steady growth. Slow growth was being recorded in the industrial countries, the annual deceleration of rates of growth. A deterioration was continuing both in the external environment and as a result of the drop in oil prices. Haw material producers continued to see an erosion in their terms of trade and consequently rising debt, as well as a reduction of net capital inflows. There has been no decision to undertake a new allocation of special drawing rights, despite the fact that conditions under the Statute had been met The meeting of GATT at Punta del Este, which launched the round, was quite successful. Regarding the round, reached by ministers, not by the contracting parties, in a declaration on trade in goods and trade in services. Trade in goods fails under the existing framework of GATT, but services remain as you know outside it. Concerning trade in services, two approaches are envisaged. First to create a possible moderating instrument governing trade in services and second, to develop other instruments. In this regard, two new areas for discussion are trade-related investment and counterfeit and intellectual property. Looking at the more general context of the round, the declaration adopted at Punta del Este notes the importance of an improved trade environment to help the debt situation of many countries, as well as of the monitoring of the flow of resources to developing countries. As far as follow-up to Punta del Este is concerned, the declaratio`n included a calendar. On 27 trade the negotiating group on goods, and the negotiating group on services. FAO has requested Observer Status in the GATT negotiations, in view of the issues under discussion which arc central to its mandate and areas of competence. A few words on UNCTAD VII. UNCTAD VII will take place in Geneva in July 1987. It will have a single agenda item focused on the revitalization of growth and international trade. The role of the private sector will be taken into account assessing trends. The be respected, and the centrally-planned economies will be included in the review. At this time, two basic documents are envisaged: one being an analytic report on the issues, the other a series of policy proposals by the Director-General of UNCTAD. briefly mention two other matters. Firstly, the United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations, or between International Organizations, took place in Vienna in March this year. The Conference adopted a convention. Signature of the convention should take place before the en d of June 1987, prior to the disposition of instruments of formal confirmation, I am informed that, in those cases where a governing body of an organization of the United Nations system will not meet before that date, arrangements are in process for signature of the convention ad referendum and subject to a decision of the competent organs. Second and last point, let me bring to your attention the two conventions which were adopted by the General Conference of IAEA at its first special session in September 1986. These conventions concern early notification of nuclear accident and assistance in case of nuclear accident or radiological emergencies. The convention on of the conventions provisionally, pending their entry into force. At point, I should like to bring my brief presentation to an end. I shall of course be happy to provide any information or clarification which members of the Council may wish to have. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sr. Presidente, la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia admira sinceramente el hecho de que nuestro colega y amigo Andr\u00e9s R\u00e9gnier-no obstante, est\u00e1 dedicado ahora a tiempo pleno a otras actividades-haya elaborado adecuadamente este documento del cual ha hecho una excelente presentacion. Parece que el nuevo administrador del PNUD empez\u00f3 bien. El p\u00e1rrafo 5, aunque un poco ambiguo o reflejo de espejismo, habla de que el aumento de las promesas pa ra 1986 \"superar\u00e1 los 745 millones de d\u00f3lares, m\u00e1s del 10 por ciento, superior al 8 por ciento convenido para incremento de las contribuciones voluntarias\". Como dijo el Sr. R\u00e9gnier en el p\u00e1rrafo 5 se afirma que esa es la cantidad mayor jam\u00e1s prometida en la historia del PNUD. Sin embargo, la ducha de agua fr\u00eda viene al final de ese mismo p\u00e1rrafo, que dice: \"Por lo que respecta a los recursos del PNUD en 1987 y los a\u00f1os futuros, la situaci\u00f3n se presenta un poco sombr\u00eda\"-sombr\u00eda, \u00e9ste es un t\u00e9rmino que se est\u00e1 poniendo de moda ahora-\"debido a las contribuciones del mayor donante\"; as\u00ed dice este p\u00e1rrafo. Este documento que tiene fecha de septiembre, o sea, hace ya casi dos meses, pens\u00e1bamos que ser\u00eda actualizado por la presentaci\u00f3n del Sr. R\u00e9gnier, pero tenemos la impresi\u00f3n de que no, que tal vez no tuvo tiempo de actualizar esas cifras porque nos ha hablado de 800 millones de d\u00f3lares y la traducci\u00f3n nos lleg\u00f3 correctamente. Quisi\u00e9ramos saber si ahora, cuando ya se conocen dos leyes del importante pa\u00eds mayor donante, aera posible preguntarnos s\u00ed la expresi\u00f3n SOMBR\u00cdA de ese p\u00e1rrafo corresponde a la realidad y a cu\u00e1nto ascender\u00e1n realmente los recursos del PNUD en 1987 y cuales son las perspectivas para los anos siguientes. \u00bfSe puede ya saber c\u00f3mo ha influido o c\u00f3mo van a influir las decisiones del mayor donante de los recursos del PNUD? La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia senala como hecho positivo la frase final del p\u00e1rrafo 8, seg\u00fan la cual \"varios pa\u00edses tanto desarrollados como en desarrollo, destacaron la necesidad de quo el PNUD aumente sus a dquisiciones de insumos, como equipos, en pa\u00edses en desarrollo\". Esperamos que esa recomendaci\u00f3n sea refrendada plenamente por este Consejo y que se incluya en el informe. -241- El p\u00e1rrafo 10 indica adem\u00e1s que el PNUD parece que va a aproximarse de nuevo en la distribuci\u00f3n de sus recursos en favor del sector agropecuario a los niveles anteriores, despu\u00e9s de que \u00e9stos hab\u00edan bajado considerablemente. Creemos que entre el 20 y el 30 por ciento de esos recursos, en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses, para el sector agr\u00edcola, es un buen \u00edndice que en nuestro informe debemos estimular con la esperanza de que aumente a\u00fan m\u00e1s en la medida en que as\u00ed lo soliciten los pa\u00edses beneficiarios de acuerdo con las prioridades que establezcan sus gobiernos. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia est\u00e1 segura de que en la FAO se pondr\u00e1 en pr\u00e1ctica la recomendaci\u00f3n contenida en el informe del Director General de las Nacioas Unidas de Desarrollo y Cooperaci\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica Internacional, seg\u00fan la cual, p\u00e1rrafo 24, se insta a las Organizaciones del Sistema a que recurran en mayor medida a las capacidades de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo para la ejecuci\u00f3n de los programas y proyectos y fomenten la cooperaci\u00f3n sur-sur a trav\u00e9s de la CTPD y mecanismos afines. Ojal\u00e1 que esto conste en nuestro informe. La Duod\u00e9cima reuni\u00f3n ministerial del Consejo Mundial de la Alimentaci\u00f3n, celebrada excepcionalmente en Roma, en junio pasado, fue poco movida. El informe est\u00e1 pleno de reservas. El nuevo Director Ejecutivo del CMA, Sr. Trant, ha llegado muy silencioso. Afortunadamente ya ha comenzado a moverse un poco y tiene el prop\u00f3sito de entrevistarse con los representantes de los gobiernos, lo cual es muy positivo. El gobierno de Colombia est\u00e1 ansioso y complacido de encontrar al Sr. Trant para reiterarle nuestro apoyo a las labores del CMA. Sin embargo, todav\u00eda tenemos dudas sobre si en realidad el CMA ha encontrado un rumbo cierto y positivo. Puede ser que a lo mejor ahora, a la luz del p\u00e1rrafo 55 se podr\u00e1 lograr el fortalecimiento de la funci\u00f3n del CMA la luz de las recomendaciones hechas por el grupo Asesor que se ocup\u00f3 de ese Consejo. Del mecanismo de coordinaci\u00f3n, como se defini\u00f3 en la Resoluci\u00f3n de la Conferencia Mundial de la Alimentaci\u00f3n, al CMA; ahora ese Consejo podr\u00eda pasar a ser, pero ojal\u00e1 de verdad y muy en serio, un catalizador pol\u00edtico, un foro para el examen de ideas, y propuestas normativas, mediante su trabajo de seguimiento de los problemas alimentarios en el mundo. Pensamos que ya tambi\u00e9n la Resoluci\u00f3n de la Conferencia Mundial habl\u00f3 de que el CMA deber\u00eda funcionar dentro del marco de la FAO, situaci\u00f3n ambigua que nunca hemos podido definir exactamente; de todos modos convendr\u00e1 que el CMA colabore con la FAO expresamente sin duplicar actividades. El ap\u00e9ndice A contiene las conclusiones y recomendaciones de la Duod\u00e9cima reuni\u00f3n ministerial del CMA, de las cuales convendr\u00e1 destacar el p\u00e1rrafo 2 porque coincide con los resultados de la discusi\u00f3n de nuestro tema 4 sobre la situaci\u00f3n de la alimentaci\u00f3n y la agricultura en el mundo. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia apoya la frase final del p\u00e1rrafo 2 del citado anexo A, sobre el hecho de que \"la eliminaci\u00f3n del hambre y la malnutrici\u00f3n se podr\u00e1 lograr mediante un proceso mundial de reestructuraci\u00f3n de las relaciones entre gobiernos, sobre una base justa, equitativa y democr\u00e1tica y con el establecimiento de un nuevo orden econ\u00f3mico internacional\". Finalmente, se\u00f1or Presidente, el p\u00e1rrafo 133 del documento 12, indica que en 1985 el total de los pr\u00e9stamos multilaterales en el sector de la agricu ltura aument\u00f3 algo en relaci\u00f3n con 1984, pero se qued\u00f3 a\u00fan por debajo de las cifras que ya se hab\u00edan logrado en 1983. En la secci\u00f3n de las Relaciones con las Ins tituciones Internacionales de Financiaci\u00f3n, se hace referencia al Banco Mundial, a los Bancos Asi\u00e1tico y Africano de Desarrollo y, s\u00f3lo muy de paso, se habla del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, BID, en el p\u00e1rrafo 133 para se\u00f1alar una disminuci\u00f3n en los cr\u00e9ditos agr\u00edcolas concedidos por el BID. Convendr\u00e1 que la Secretar\u00eda actualice esa informaci\u00f3n, pues tenemos noticias seg\u00fan las cuales el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo est\u00e1 aumentando sus cr\u00e9ditos al sector agropecuario. -242- Al final del p\u00e1rrafo 140 apar ece un cuadro que contiene los principales organismos de cr\u00e9ditos que cooperan con la FAO y con los cuales el Centro de Inversiones ha ayudado a formular numerosos proyectos en el sector agr\u00edcola. En ese cuadro aparecen el Banco Mundial, el FIDA y los Bancos Asi\u00e1tico y Africano de Desarrollo. \u00bfy el BID?. \u00bfEl BID no aparece en ese cuadro? \u00bfAcaso no ha asistido el Centro de Inversiones de la FAO al BID en la preparaci\u00f3n de proyectos agr\u00edcolas?. Hacemos esta pregunta porque luego, despu\u00e9s del p\u00e1rrafo 142, apar ecen las regiones beneficiadas con los proyectos apoyados por el Centro de Inversiones, y como podr\u00e1 verse en ese p\u00e1rrafo 142, Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe ocupan el \u00faltimo lugar entre las regiones en desarrollo. Creemos que la FAO debe estrechar cada vez m\u00e1s sus relaciones con nuestro Banco Regional y no olvidarlo completamente. Vaclav DOBES (Czechoslovakia): I would like to We the presented CL 90/12 very lucid and important the Council's work. We have studied it carefully because in a number of United Nations General Assembly bodies and at the Sessions of General Conference of Agencies we often happen to hear questions concerning the coordination, inter-relation and cooperation within the whole system of the United Nations. Allow me to raise a few very brief questions, answers to which are of interest to us. First of all we think that the Thirty-Third Session of the UNDP Governing Council the UNDP fourth programme cycle for the years 1987/91 was of fundamental importance to the FAO field programme. I would like to ask the Secretariat what share the FAO is expected to take in the developing projects of the next cycle. Of course, the could serve for if forty-four of the projects the value of which amount more than one billion dollars have already been approved and the share of agriculture will be 22 percent to 30 percent. Then it may be of interest to the Council to know whether the projects are supposed to be realized by FAO or whether there are some other ideas too. With respect to the forty-four country programmes, the review of FAO's participation should be known relatively of the Report concerning recent developments in UNIDO, we believe that the issue of the UNDP Technological Centre should be of extraordinary interest to FAO. Could the Council be informed of the FAO intentions concerning the problem of cooperation with UNIDO in the field of agriculture and food technologies ? As to the part concerning the achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women, I would like to say that we appreciate that FAO does not consider the programme of the advancement of women finished by the United Nations Decade. I am convinced that the Council will fu rther support the FAO efforts in this field. The Development of New and Renewable Sources of Energy mentioned on page 15 of the document is long term and at the same time the practical problem, the general importance to agriculture of which is hardly underestimated by anybody. We appreciate that in the European region the cooperation network of European institutes and regional project related to the follow-up activities on the implementation of the Nairobi Programme of Action of the Development of New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The document contains only a few short paragraphs concerning the International Year of Peace and the problem of decolonization. However, on this occasion I would also to emphasize that the issue of peace and disarmament and that of the development and struggl e against poverty and the need for the elimination of hunger from our planet are communicating vessels. It is in the interest of our Organization to contribute within its possibilities to the relaxation of international tension and support all the United Nations efforts aimed at the strengthening of peace directed against further well. -243- Marc-Andr\u00e9 FREDETTE (Canada): Let me first note with satisfaction that CL 90/12 includes a new section on decisions of the UNDP Governing Council as requested at the Conference, as expanded coverage of relevant activities of ECOSOC and the United Nations General Assembly. Better reporting and acknowledgement is a logical first step for the improved follow-up to the decisions and requests of the United Nations central organs. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate in detail known indeed a statement in itself to be able to refer to ten years of frustrating appeals in this regard. Suffice it t\u00f2 report this is an objective Canada has persistently pursued, not only in FAO but throughout the United Nations system. I might point out also that it is not Canada's desire but the desire of ECOSOC and the United Nations General Assembly to improve coordination to which I will now refer. I wish to point this out because it is not a point we would like later to be recorded as a Canadian concern but clearly as a concern that has been recognised and decided upon by several organs of the United Nations, that is the United Nations General Assembly and ECOSOC, to which all members of this Council here belong, and decisions to which they have all participated. Secondly, I wish to recall that the impact for a given cost. This is specially crucial in these days of budgetary restraint and more than ever relevant to FAO now in the light of its financial crisis. Indeed, Canada has become so disillusioned in this regard that we probably would not have raised this matter if it were not for the critical financial situation of our Organization. Even in this carefully drafted document by the Secretariat no coordination emerges as a major and recurrent theme. The in the field was underlined at the last ECOSOC. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 14/177 stressed the need for effective and improved coordination in the UN system. Ideally these things would go without saying. However, they must be said. In my statement I will refer to and quote from documents already approved by central United Nations organs, incidentally are available in all official United Nations languages and I hope this will prevent any points of order or other obstacles from preventing expression central framework for promoting more coherent and coordinated approaches to all the UN technical their full support for improved coherence of action by the UN system at the country level and for the role of resident coordinators in accordance with UN General 1 may digress briefly, 1 would submit that there is very little indeed unfortunately that this whole Council could probably agree to, but perhaps one of them might be the primacy of food and agriculture, and I hope another is the need for improved coordination. That Resolution comments on the implementation of the present Resolution, in particular, and I quote, \"On the role coordinators, the use as framework for offices and further harmonization procedures. \" May T point out as well, given the debate here in the past two days, that the same Resolution, once again adopted by all of us, gave a mandate to the UN Secretariat, \"To conduct further comparative analyses of the relationship between programme oh the one hand and administrative and support \"costs on the other hand. \" Despite the obvious ambivalence of this body to pursue the matter, there is clearly a signal from the central UN organs to which we all agreed that this matter does deserve our attention, once again, particularly in these days of constraints. -244- Finally, we must bring the Council's attention to an oversight in the coverage of the document under this agenda item. I refer to the report of the JIU on Structure and Coordination of Field Representatives at UN Agencies in document A/41/A24. This interesting document states inte r alia , and I quote \"that there is an excess of field establishments, that it is sometimes doubtful whether all Country Representatives are fully occupied in the field, and that the overall pattern of representation does not make complete sense. \" Such bluntness is rare in UN language. It therefore strikes us that this issue is serious enough to warrant an independent review, perhaps conducted by the JIU, particularly in light of the FAO current financial crisis. Indeed we should heed the recommendation of the JIU in report, I quote, \"The governing body of each organization should (a) put a stay on new arrangements for the establishment of field representation, (b) test the cost effectiveness and efficiency of its field representation by reviewing the following...\"-I will not read to you all the criteria but I will highlight a few. One is whether the cost of field representation in all individual cases is justified by the quantum of services delivered, whether representatives have the required authority to take necessary decisions in the field, whether all representatives have the professional and managerial talents necessary for the conduct of their responsibilities, the extent to which UNDP services are used in the field. I will save you the boredom of the other criteria, but certainly there is a proposal there that deserves serious consideration. As an example of the relevance of such a review to the current financial situation here in FAO, may I quote one last time from that report. Paragraph 41 of the JIU report \"FAO began setting country offi ces in 1977. Th ere are now some 70 of them. At the end of 1983...\"-which is when the report stops-\"county offices had a total staff...\"-and I presume it has increased since 1983-\"...of 117 international professionals and 543 General Service staff, \" During the corresponding period the number of FAO experts, the heart of this Organization, declined from 1964 to 1719. I therefore submit that there is here an issue of priorities and that there is at least sufficient material to warrant a review from the point of view of considering economies in this Organization by looking at this JIU report and its impact in FAO. In conclusion, I believe we simply cannot afford not to look seriously and objectively issues, particularly in the light of possible economies at a time when FAO resources are most stressed. Igor KIPMAN (Brazil): Document CL 90/12 enabled us to have a comprehensive and in-depth review of the relevant recent developments in the United Nations system of interest to FAO and once again reflected procedures and careful work of the Secretariat. Among all the information therein included, there are some aspects of the Twelfth Ministerial Session of the World Food Council which I would like to comment upon for their relevance and importance, and here I will be perfectly in line with the observation made by his Excellency Bula Hoyos regarding this subject. Among the many important conclusions and recommendations produced by the Council, special remark is to be attributed to its paragraph 12, which underlines the conclusions reached at the Buenos Aires consultation held last April when Latin American Caribbean Ministers explored practical ways of encouraging regional cooperation in food trade and food security, especially the initiative of th e Presidents of Agentina and Uruguay for a treaty for emergency food situations. Furthermore, I want to recall the request made to the Council to bring the critical problems that affect the agricultural economy of the countries o. f the region to the attention of the industrialized countries and international financial and credit organization and also the request to point out with the-greatest possible by the on the production systems of the developing countries and the need for the former to introduce drastic adjustments in their agricultural policies. To conclude, a special reference should be made to the fact that the question regarding the future of the Organization has remained unresolved since the Working Group report on the strengthening of the role of the World Food Council was not examined with the attention and care that its important findings paragraph issuance of so many should lead us all to careful meditation and consideration of the present and future role of the Organization. Rainer PRESTIEN (Germany, Federal Republic of): My delegation would like to thank the Secretariat for the comprehensive compilation of recent developments in the United Nations system of interest to FAO in document CL 90/12. We have gathered from the document that FAO participates in a wide range of activities within the United Nations system and makes in all cases a qualified contribution from its field of work. We particularly welcome the noticeable efforts towards increased coordination in the United Nations system, as mentioned in particular in paras. 72 and 73, but also in many other paragraphs of the document. An intensive cooperation between the individual organizations in the UN system is also in our opinion of special importance. We, therefore, particularly welcome the close cooperation of FAO with WHO, as stated in paras. 26 to 31. We feel that FAO can make a valuable contribution under the aspect of nutrition to the world health strategy of WHO. In the chapter on the ACC Task Force on Rural Development we particularly welcome the publication, as mentioned in para. 45, \"Guiding principles for the design and use of monitoring and evaluation in rural development projects and programmes\". The increased attention given by the Task Force to the role of women is also in our opinion of importance. In the chapter on UNDP we particularly welcome the increase in UNDP resources to the highest level so far (para. 5). In this respect, we likewise welcome the high share of 20 to 30 percent of UNDP funds to be earmarked for the agricultural sector. In our national bilaterial development cooperation the share for agriculture and rural development is even slightly over 30 percent. We welcome ECOSOC Resolution 1986/74 as it appears as Appendix. B to the document before us. We consider para. 19 of this Resolution of particular importance. Tomofumi (Japan): We appreciate very much document CL 90/12 prepared by the Secretariat. That document provides us with a very brief review of the recent activ ities of the UN system of particular interest to FAO. We feel that such a review is very useful for the FAO in order to manage the Organization's activity effectively and to establish FAO's so as to avoid possible duplication in its activities. In particular we recall the Twelfth Ministerial Session of the World Food Council in Rome which made useful suggestions with regard to the food centre development in Africa. It is desirable that FAO should take into account these RAHMAN (Bangladesh): My delegation first of all like to express its sincere appreciation to the Secretariat and Mr Renier in particular for his presentation of document CL 90/12. It is a comprehensive paper which incorporates of life of their people. Pioneering work of the multilateral agencies including FAO in fighting the scourge of hunger and malnutrition was almost foreshadowed by that great humanist and noble laureate, Ralph Bunche when he said \"Peace must be translated into bread and rice, shelter, health and education as well as freedom and human dignity\". The efforts of the international community to ensure better coordination amongst the UN agencies has been on the agenda as long as the UN system itself. In this connection the document CL 90/12 presented by the Secretariat, which is under discussion, assumes a special significance under this effort. My delegation has noted with satisfaction the level of cooperation that FAO maintains with other organizations of the UN system. In particular we noted with satisfaction the leading role that the FAO is giving the ACC Sub-Committee on Nutrition. I should also like to mention the work done by the ACC task force on Rural Development which is headed by FAO. -246- The conclusions and the recommendations of the 12th Ministerial Session of the World Food Council held in Rome in June 1986 have inter alia rightly stated that in respect of the world food situation there were reasons for both satisfaction and concern. There are nations that have food surpluses but a number of developing countries have experienced a deterioration in their food situation. To add to their miseries these countries suffer adversely in respect of trade in food and agricultural commodities. We agree with the World Food Council that national food objectives cannot be achieved without the support of increased international solidarity and cooperation. We note that the present food and agricultural situation is not in the interests of either developed or developing countries. I should now like to refer to the 33rd Session of the Governing Council of UNDP. It is heartening to note that the Governing Council approved 44 country programmes over the next five years at a total allocation of about $1 billion of which about 20-30 percent are in the agricultural sector. We are also pleased to note that UNDP continues to lend its active support to the technica l assistance activities. We welcome the stress given on the need for UNDP. to make increasing use of inputs, including equipment, from developing country sources. We are confident that FAO derived better benefit from the UNDP fund and cater for the needs of country we particularly decision the UNDP and the of undertaken. need cooperation international Role all\" held during the 39th World Health Assembly at Geneva in May 1986. The formation of the Working Group of WHO on Agriculture, Food and Nutrition stressed the need for integrated policy and planning in respect of agricultural and development policies. The working group recommended that governments should formulate comprehensive and health policies in issues of equity and the special needs of identified target groups. It is really heartening to note that FAO and WHO have agreed to have consultations to discuss the practical application of the recommendations and to draft a plan for joint action. It is known to all that the General Assembly at its 40th Session stressed the need for effective and improved coordination in the United Nations system. It gives us pleasure to know that FAO has been maintaining a close working relationship with the relevant UN agencies such as UNDP, UNIDO, WHO. Apart from those, the investment centre of FAO has established a close relationship with almost all the multilateral financing institutions for giving investment support to the developing countries. My country is a beneficiary of that. In this connection the sharp decrease in the second replenishment of IFAD gives us cause for concern. My delegation has noted with satisfaction that the FAO maintains close cooperative relations with UNDP and the affected as part of its normal field activities and also as part of its emergency operations. A number of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, including my own, are prone to be periodically affected by natural disasters. In a rare demonstration of solidarity the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution in its 40th Session pledging support for long-term solutions to the economic problems that my country faces as a result of natural disasters. The observance of an International year of peace gives us satisfaction. In my own country in pursuance of the General Assembly resolution we have formed a national committee to observe this year in a befitting manner and we have given all cooperation to UN to make this year a success. Before 1 conclude I should like to compliment Mr Regnier again for his reference co some important meetings which are not included in this report such as the meeting ac Punta del Este, UNCTAD VII, and the pledging conference in New York with particular reference to the Punta del Este meeting. It has been our opinion that developing in any future decisions or resolutions which are going to take place as a follow-up to the Punta del Este meeting. -247- My last, but not the least, point is a query to the Secretariat. Very recently, as a result of the big debate of the 2nd Committee in New York, (I believe it is still going on but 1 do not know) according to the report of the Committee of eighteen wise men certain far reaching decisions are likely to be taken. Is there any relevance in the recommendations of the 18 wise men which could have been reflected in this report, but were not? Robbie Matongo MUP\u00c1WOSE which previous speaker from Bangladesh has made and we agree with some of the comments made by speakers as to the relationship between FAO and other sister organizations. However, if you will bear with me, there is an item which I feel needs some comment from us. In the document which we examined, CL 90/12, there are sections of it which so far other members have either ignored or are happy to delete. I am talking specifically about sections 126 to 131. which apply to areas of decolonization and related matters. Lest it is cried foul that one is talking politics in a food production arena, let me dispel those sentiments because I am treating this issue on the basis of food production. You will be aware r ecently at the UN and the Non-Aligned Countries Conference, and also the Commonwealth Conference issues of apartheid in South Africa and the issue of the independence of Namibia and the destabilization of the southern African region have been discussed. I think it will be very unfortunate if members of this Council do not take note of the fact that in these regions there are people, small farmers, who are being deprived of an opportunity to carry out their daily activities. It was very interesting yesterday to listen to the representative of the United States expressing her sentiments and pleading for small farmers, and we very much agree with those sentiments. One wonders whether some of these sentiments are also in sympathy with some of the activities of some of our larger contributors. I am not talking here specifically of one contributor but of the first, second and following^ who themselves have a role to play in the response of the United Nations and some of these organizations as far as responsibility towards the plight of citizens of member countries know people suffering a result of situations depriving small farmers from going about their daily work. Over the last few days we have been preoccupied here in discussing the issue of finances to FAO and how this will assist farmers. Yet there are people in the countries who themselves do not even have the opportunity of using these resources from FAO because they are deprived as a result of destabilization within their country. We think it is important that those members of this Organization should take cognizance of this. The issue of giving food assistance, whether through WFP or whatever organization, of assisting some of the hungry people in these areas, is not necessarily enough. I think people should go beyond that, by examining their consciences and ensuring that they are assisting wishes of members in those countries. I also want to note the fact that in these areas one finds people who have become refugees from their countries. As a result, they have to be assisted by neighbouring countries. We would appeal to organizations like FAO to assist some of these people in the refugee camps by developing and assisting programmes which will help not to merely helpless refugees, but active individuals who will participate in those resources so that they can prepare themselves for when they eventually go back to their countries. There is the question of sanctions which I have made mention of. This question has been raised in different fora. Yet we are aware of the many sanctimonious pleas by many large countries on the ineffectiveness of sanctions. Who are we to question the effectiveness when the very citizens of South Africa and these countries have decided what they want and they are prepared to die for their country. It is said that a pittance of sanctions will not be effective. Of course, sanctions were never intended to solve the plight of people in South Africa, but anything that can be done to dissociate and isolate that obnoxious system of apartheid in Africa will be very much welcomed. -248- So I would like it recorded and noted that whilst we are talking of food and food assistance and development programmes there are some who are being deprived not because they do not want to work, not because they are lazy, but because the activities of some of our member countries are in life very difficult Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (original language Arabic): We are pleased to see that the cooperation between FAO and the various UN agencies is increasing, especially in coordinating developmental activities, as shown in document. For example, the document refers to the cooperation with UNIDO in the field of analysing the social and economic researches and policies, the follow-up and evaluation of the achievements of the UN Decade for Women, and the UN Conference on Science and Technology for Development. My delegation would like to commend the close cooperation that exists between FAO and the multilateral financial institutions for the benefits which the member countries can reap from this kind of cooperation. We fully appreciate the role played by the investment centre in helping countries prepare investment projects. We would like to reiterate our support for the important role FAO is playing in Africa. We appreciate its contribution to the economic recovery of Africa through global agricultural development. Finally, we should like to thank Mr R\u00e9gnier who presented this document. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I too should like to thank Mr R\u00e9gnier for document CL 90/12 and his presentation, as well as the additional news he gave us. These accounts of the activities of sister organizations and cooperating groups are well written, interesting and, as far as I am able to see from my knowledge of the few of the meetings covered, accurate and objectvive. Like the delegate of Canada, I was pleased to note that the coverage now included meetings of the UN Development Programme Governing Council. I start, however, with a question which I hope will not be regarded as a rude one. Are all these interesting reports necessary for the Board or for us as the Board members? 1 have in mind that governments should be aware of the developments in most since governments groupings reported on, such as the ACC Task Force, I can see that information is less readily available and here the document is providing a service. But how are the rest selected for presentation to us? Obviously, they are ones that happened recently since the last report and, I was told, are about things not on the agenda elsewhere. Perhaps the reports have other uses, to inform staff or the public, and the work in preparing them for us is marginal. If so, my point falls away, but having cast doubts on the need for some of these reports, perhaps I should say what I see as the real reporting requirement. This is a report on those meetings and decisions taken within the UN system which have significant implications for FAO or, in the case of decisions, are addressed directly or indirectly to FAO, together with what response is to be made and the action required of the Director-General or the governing bodies. This second is not only desirable for reasons of courtesy and efficiency; it is also needed to meet one of the key points in that important resolution of ECOSOC referred to by our colleagues from at Annex B of CL 90/12. I have particularly in mind paragraph 14 which the the United Nations system concerned with operational activities for development so is recommended or planned to developments in other organizations, I am not suggesting FAO should always a ccept and implement emerging expect a spirited defence of our sectoral interests, but if the Secretariat believes that the s uggestions are misconceived they should say so and the delegations will seek to attain consistent policies in the different parts of their own governments. -249- An example of what I have in mind of the way that a report should be written is CL 90/19, which we are going to discuss under the next item on the follow-up to the UN Special Session on the critical economic situation in Africa, where the report to Council outlines for discussion or decision future action by the FAO. There are other examples I could quote, such as the verbal reports just given on locusts and on the future replacement of the IAEA, where we were told of the implications for FAO and what we had to do. An example of the weakness I am drawing attention to is in the report of the UNDP Governing Council which, though a good report of the meeting, does not pick up the several points for decision which are directed to the agencies covering such matters as the inclusion of information on agency projects in the UNDP country policy papers and on procurement as mentioned by my colleague from Bangladesh. I could make the same point and go on grumbling about the report of the policy review by ECOSOC of operational activities for development, but I will not do so because CL 90/12 does quote the very important I would prefer to on this. I am saved extensively from doing this by the remarks of my from Canada, and 1 can shorten my remarks because I agree so fundamentally with what he said. Perhaps 1 could say that for years we have admired the intellectual effort which has been put in by Canada to the subject of coordination and the skill and sensitivity with which the Canadian delegation, and other delegations here too modest to come forward 1 think, has steered it through the UNDP Governing Council, and these ideas resolution. The ECOSOC specific action by the specialized agencies or organizations in the UN system. I will not list them but just refer in passing to the operative paragraphs. Paragraph 8 to strengthen their capacity coordination at and sectoral level, which us all; paragraph 14 carry-out their role; paragraph is about field administration and collocation of field offices. In this regard I would support the proposal of the delegate of Canada for an independent consideration of this issue. 23 is about about support for the UN coordinator, support for him from governments and agencies delegate of Canada, ourselves, which invites the governing bodies of the organization of the United Nations system to reaffirm their full support for improved coherence of action by the system at the country level and for the role of the resident coordinator in accordance with General 32/197...\" I would suggest that this Council reaffirm this this Session. as the delegate invited to provide ECOSOC at its second regular session next year with views and comments on the implementation of the resolution, in particular on the role of the resident coordinators, the use of the United Nations Development Programme country programming process as a framework for operational offices of operational procedures. \" I should like to ask for information from the Director-General as to what the current plans are for responding to this request, and at what stage it is proposed that the membership would be involved in this, since the invitation is to the bodies. As I Committee. Without criticise this Committee, I observe that the response seen from the perspective of Geneva, didn't seem to be particularly helpful on this. I had hoped that both \"content of the handling could be different on this occasion and that our response will be po sitively framed. My ow n that ECOSOC should be considered at our fits the relevant timetable. Finally, my other comments are on paragraphs 26 to 31 and 32 to 40 of the report. My colleagues, in the part of our ministry concerned with health matters, have specifically requested me to welcome the efforts seen in the collaboration between the FAO and WHO to encourage comprehensive agriculture and health policies involving a coordinated approach by the UN agencies and to welcome the plans to improve exchange of experience and provide appropriate training. -250- As to the work of the ACC Subcommittee on Nutrition, I am not sure if this is the place to say this but I am not sure where one does give comments on an ACC Subcommittee, to whose budgets th e specialized agency contributes. However, I am encouraged by the news that FAO has a leadership role here. I just have to say that the UK will continue to make the point made as an observer at the last meeting in Tokyo, that if the SCN hopes to meetings and reveal to M. Afzal QADIR (Pakistan): We admire the document, but even more so, the author who prepared it. I know Dr Regnier. I worked with him and I am fully aware of the motivation and dedication with which he conducts his responsibilities. Having said this, I would like to raise one or two very minor issues. My first observation relates to paragraph 138 of the document relating to IFAD-International Fund for Agriculture and Development. I think the paragraph stops short of saying that the contributions have so far been placed for a bout 200 million. I th ink it should have been expanded to reflect the situation that now apparently obtains. We are all aware of the fact that a special programme for Africa has already become effective and that five projects involving a total outla y of 110 million dollars have been approved and these projects are going to benefit over 15 countries. I do not know why this information was withheld. I am absolutely sure that it is not wilful, because we are all aware that FAO and IFAD are close partners for progress. They are close partners in a great human endeavour in Africa. I think, therefore, that this FAO document should have reflected the good work that IFAD is doing. This is my first observation. The second observation that I am going to make, I might even suggest, is that the scope of the document could be broadened a little more in order to reflect FAO's consultation with some inter-governmental bodies. My reason for saying so is that earlier this year three of us, the distinguished Ambassador of Turkey, the distinguished Ambassador of Iran and I had gone to see Dr Saouma saying that a new economic cooperation organization has been established between the three countries. Between these three countries agriculture plays a dominant role, or an important role in their economies for the FAO should be willing to provide such assistance, as the require, activities and prospects of these countries. Dr Saouma was kind enough to assure that he will extend fullest cooperation. This nascent organization-this ECO-Economic Cooperation Organization between Turkey, Pakistan and Iran. It is a new organization therefore 1 would like to see in future reports what the FAO is doing to assist this organization in its endeavours to advance the agricultural sector in the three countries in a regional context. Beyond this I do not think I would like to add anything further, 1 would like to thank Dr R\u00e9gnier once again for the very excellent document he has produced and the way in which he has introduced it to us. James E. ROSS (United States of America): My comments pertain to paragraphs 50-56 of document CL The US delegation would like to note the appointment of a new Executive Director for the World Food Council. We want to express our confidence that he will be able to guide the Council in a manner which will make it a highly effective organization, capable of making a very significant contribution to international agricultural and WFC should closely coordinate their efforts in order to make the most use of the limited resources available to the two organizations.

Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I would like to place on record the full support of India to the points raised by my distinguished colleague from Zimbabwe. The Non-Aligned Summit in Harare mandated Foreign Minister of other distinguished foreign ministers, started with a visit to Rome. Naturally, at this meeting there was a great sense of cooperation and mutual understanding. It is not our intention to politicize the matter which is already highly politicized, but we should bear in mind that the type of problems that arc created, and likely to be created around South Africa are going to place an additional burden on the FAO and the WFP at a time when their resources are already stretched. The distinguished representative of Zimbabwe mentioned the problems of small farmers. We also know that Zimbabwe has had a flourishing agriculture. It has surpluses in maize. It is a front line state, just like a number of other front line states. The UN has expressed its opinion and its decisions a number of times regarding South Africa. I think we should take note of the fact that if refugees are created by South Africa's actions with nobody to help and small farmers who are productive are to be thrown out of their land, they become a liability. They become a liability not because they wish to be a liability, but because they have no choice. Perhaps one should thinking of steps to assist A point raised by my distinguished colleague from Pakistan is important. There should be some reference to the committed projects. Here also, it is a matter of concern that the funds available for IFAD have fallen. Here is an organization which is really helpful to developing countries. Developing countries do not like to be on the dole. They like to develop. Political and military pressures which are being exercised in Southern Africa and the neighbouring states (should not become factors or reasons for the trend towards development of agriculture in the developing world to be Otherwise, world food programme for development to develop. This is a point which we have to bear in mind and whilst we. would not like to politicize, we cannot keep everything in watertight compartments. Paul A. BOMANI (Tanzania): I had indicated my desire to take an option on speaking later and I feel that we have exhausted the discussion on this very important subject. I only wish to endorse. very strongly the remarks made by my colleagues with regard to problems of d\u00e9stabilisation in Southern Africa caused by and perpetrated by the apartheid regime of Pretoria. Coming from front line states, as we are, we have first-hand experience \u00bfn the problems that engage and affect the people of that area. As my colleague from Zimbabwe stated, that despite the fact that Zimbabwe -252- has been fortunate in having a good record crop this year, the neighbouring country, Mozambique, is facing a serious problem of starvation; nearly one and a half million people are facing serious problems of starvation because they were not able to cultivate and produce food for themselves. It is in this regard that I would add my voice to the points that have been expressed effectively by my colleagues. Now, the question of destabilisation of independent countries in southern Africa must not be neglected and we do have responsibility in making sure that those people enjoy freedom, to produce and feed themselves. Evlogui BONEV (UNDP): Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the Ninetieth Session of the Council of FAO on behalf of the Administrator of UNDP, Mr Draper III, who wishes you every su ccess in your important work. FAO is the largest executing agency for UNDP-financed projects and we therefore attach a great importance to our cooperation with this agency. The document prepared by the FAO Secretariat on the various issues of cooperation and collaboration activities of this Organization with other organizations within the United Nations system during the period under review can serve as a good basis for the deliberations of the Council. We arc very pleased to see the document CL 90/12 information on proceedings on important decisions of the last session of the Governing Council of the UNDP which we interpret as a testimony of the importance the FAO attaches to its cooperation with UNDP. We welcome this initiative of FAO as we consider it a very important element for strengthening the cooperation between the two organizations and for ensuring better consistency their governing bodies in dealing with common issues. Allow me to give you some fresh figures on the delivery by FAO of technical assistance financed by the UNDP. It is worth noting the total expenditure on the UNDP-financed FAO projects in 1985 amounted to US$ 122. 3 million, or one million more than in 1984. Logically, a substantial share, over 40 percent of these resources, went to the African region where most of the needs are. We expect a substantial increase in the delivery of technical assistance in the current year for which the total approved budget for the UNDP finance and FAO executed already reached US$ 191 million. Again of the tota l approved budgets main tains its level of over 40 percent, as a computer printout just before my arrival here showed. This trend may continue during the next give the technical cooperation activities in the field of competence of FAO. You may recall that for that cycle, the share of the African region in the central resources of UNDP rises to over 40 percent of the total in comparison to below 37 percent in the present cycle. The share of the LDCs; alone goes up 41. 4 percent in comparison to the 37 percent in the current cycle and a major number of the LDCs, as we well know, are in this region. Allow me to give you some more details on the outcome of the last June session of the Governing Council of the UNDP. This Session was considered of special significance as it was a session during which the first package of country programmes for the fourth cycle 1987/1991 was approved. The Council approved forty-four country which the total resources programme amounted to US$ 3 023 million. Agriculture represented 25 percent of the overall expenditure for these programmes. It is important to note also that in 1987 the Governing. Council of the UNDP will approve over 80 more country programmes in the various regions of the globe. The share of FAO in the implementation of the programmes will on the rate the recipient themselves give to the sectors coming the competence of this Organization. Another important event during this Session was the deliberations during the high level segment of the Session, the theme of which was the role of UNDP in human resources development and development cooperation in the 1980s. I refer to this issue in view of the particular interest of the FAO in it and its role as specialised agency in assisting developing countries in building up their human resources in the fields of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, etc. We are pleased to note how this matter is highlighted in the FAO document CL 90/12. A challenge as multi- -253- dimensional as this calls closer cooperation across the board. Human developments strategies involve multiple partners in many different sectors. We could not agree more that this is an area in which FAO has been actively engaged for many years and we will look forward to enhancing our cooperation. With regard to the role foreseen for the UNDP I would like to draw attention to the decision 86/14 adopted by the Governing Council after the high level deliberations. Another issue of considerable importance and relevance to FAO dealt with by the Governing Council of the UNDP at its last Session is the issue of coordination, which is referred to in paragraph 8 of the document CL 90/12. This issue was mentioned by triennial report of the Director-General for International Economic Cooperation and Development and the therein. In effectiveness and efficiency of operational activities for development of the United Nations systems; expresses its concern at the decline UNDP in total technical cooperation of activities for development: reaffirms the central Development Programme in funding technical cooperation activities for development within the United Nations system; and emphasises the need to provide the Programme with increased and adequate resources to fulfill its role. of triennial review of operational activities for development inter Resolution 32/197) and responding of the countries' objectives; encouraging the use of the country programme agencies; encouraging the use of national and regional input and expertise in the implementation of projects whenever possible; the the and supporting TCDC in compliance, in particular, with the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and other relevant decisions. Lastly, it was increasing resources for operational activities. I further details more effective integration of women in development was the focus of several statements. The Council adopted two this subject. evaluation; assistance to the Movements; the IPF of Namibia, the Special Needs of the Island Developing Countries, and the substantial New Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries. All of them can be found in the report of the Governing Council to ECOSOC, document /1986/29 which is also a document placed before the current session of the General Assembly for its consideration. I was very pleased to hear the updated information by Mr Regnier, to whom I am very grateful, updating the last events related to the pledging conference for UNDP at the present General Assembly session. I do not want to repeat the figures which he correctly mentioned. I would like, however, to say that if achieved, this total amount of US$ 800 million, which partly is pledged and partly will come as it was indicated by governments which were not in a position to pledge now due to their internal legislation. I would like to refer here to the statement of the Ambassador of Colombia who asked included. 1 would like to inform him that in the best estimates, which are in the figure of US$ \"800 million, according to the information have received from UNDP, the donation, the contribution, of the major is also included, as it was informally unofficially indicated to the and which subject to confirmation later n. I should not miss this opportunity to express the profound thanks of the Administrator of UNDP, Mr Draper III, to all those countries, developed and developing alike, which have contributed first for a breathtaking 48 percent increase, and that is after last year's splendid 46 percent like, to Denmark and Italy out in front with 19 percent increase, to Spain and France with 18 percent and 16 percent increase, respectively, to the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands with 13 percent and 10 percent increase, respectively, to Sweden with 11. percent increase, Austria 9 increase respectively, and Norway and Canada with 7 percent and 6 percent, just to name a few of them. We cannot help mentioning that when it comes to donors as well. Among meet or surpass the Governing Council 8 percent target. They are Barbados, Bhutan, Bolivia, China, Cook Islands, Cuba, Guatemala, Maldives, Paraguay, Poland, Republic of Korea, Somalia and Yugoslavia. The Administrator's profound thanks and special gratitude goes to them as well. Closing my statement, Mr Chairman, I would like first to tell you that 1 have taken very careful note of all comments here by the Council and these comments will be duly transmitted to the Administrator of UNDP, and I was gratified to hear those comments. I would like the executing agencies and particularly with FAO in the common task of assisting the efforts of the developing countries towards their better future. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: I would like if 1 may to comment on just two points before handing over the microphone to my colleague, Mr Regnier, to reply to a number of other issues that came up during the course of the debate. My first point relates to the queries that were raised about how FAO will respond to operative paragraph 35 of the ECOSOC Activities for Development. This appears as Appendix in the document which the Council is now discussing. Paragraph 35 invites the governing bodies of UN System to provide ECOSOC with-and then follows a list of points on which information is requested. A somewhat similar request was made by the Economic and Social Council a year ago, and FAO was one of the few agencies that made a specific response through the Programme response came the Programme Committee because there was no meeting of the Council this year in mid-year. This will not be the same position in 1987 and consequently the orderly procedure will be for th is matter to go first to the Programme Committee in the Spring and then to the Council at its session in the Summer. The Council report can then be forwarded to ECOSOC. The second point I want to comment on relates to a proposal that there be an independent evaluation of the FAO country offices. The Director-General has currently organizing an evaluation by an external panel of three of the FAO Action Programmes. These external evaluations do cost quite a lot of money. The Council has before it as Appendix A to one of the reports of the Finance Committee, the Annual Report of Budgetary Performance to Member Nations, in which a notation is made that $700 000 was transferred to cover the evaluation of the TCP and of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Programme for Africa. About half of that covered the cost of evaluating the TCP. The current evaluation now also involve the Director-General is unlikely to be forthcoming in taking the initiative and going ahead with an evaluation of the country offices in response individual is decided by the governing bodies of the Organization, it will of course be carried out. I will now give the floor to Mr Regnier. -255- A. le Nations Unies York.

There are two reasons for the Council to give particular attention to this agenda item. The first derives from the concern of the international community regarding the African food problem. This concern was articulated by the FAO Conference last November in a resolution on \"The Critical Situation of Food and Agriculture in Africa\". In the second place, there is a practical issue for decision by the Council referred to it by the Regional Conference for Africa. The question is whether the Director-General should be given a mandate carry out a feasibility study for stepping up aid-in-kind in the form of agricultural inputs. Perhaps I can first briefly sketch in the background. There have been two separate series of actions over the last couple of years, centred, respectively, on the United Nations and FAO. Separate streams of action, but meeting each other at many points along the way. The first of these two series of events is reported in document CL 90/19. It relates to the General Assembly's Special Session of last May devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa. This is the first time a Special Session has been devoted by the General Assembly to the problems of a particular region. The session was elaborately prepared with documentation drawn up in both Addis Ababa and New York. FAO provided a major input to the agricultural sections of both documents. The General Assembly adopted a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986/1990. Within the Programme of Action agriculture is by far the most prominent sector. Cost estimates are included, within the General Assembly's resolution, for the resources, both domestic and international, required to implem\u00e9nt the various components of the programme of action. For the record, I would mention that the total figure is about 128 b illion dollars over five almost direct the particular attention of the Council, not so much to the absolute figure, as to the way in which it is made up. About 45 percent is for agricultural development. A slightly greater proportion, slightly more than another 45 percent, is covered by the heading \"Other Sectors in support agriculture\". On top resources development\"-both of them areas which of course are very closely connected with agriculture. It is thus no exaggeration to say that the UN dominated by requirements related directly recognized as the priority of priorities. The follow-up of the UN Programme will take place mainly at national level. African Governments are free to choose their own mechanism for this purpose, but it is understood that this will be the World Bank Consultative Group or UNDP Round Table in countries where other mechanisms exist. The attached that one the large-scale flows of aid. -261- At the Secretariat level within the United Nations, a Steering Committee has been established under the Chairmanship of the Director-General for Development and International Economic Cooperation. Membership of the Steering Committee is limited to the various components of the United Nations itself, but specialized agencies are invited to participate on an ad hoc basis, and I myself attended the first session last September. One of the problems which arise from these arrangements is that FAO has so far had only a limited and intermittent role in the organization of UNDP Round Tables, and has had little contact with the Consultative Groups which I may recall are to be the main follow-up mechanisms at the national level. This problem was recognized by the UN Steering Committee which, as recorded in document CL 90/19, has the fact that specialized agencies have sectoral Round Groups. The UN Programme of Action, although focussed on agriculture, does not, tackle directly the many technical problems associated with a faster growth of agriculture and food production in Africa. These problems have, however, been dealt with exhaustively in the course of the second chain of events which I referred to earlier. This second stream of action dates from FAO Regional Conference for Africa in 1984 at Harare, and is covered in document CL 90/21. The Regional Conference at Harare requested the Director-General to carry out an in-depth study of the continent's agricultural problems. This was the subject of intensive work over a period of two years. The preliminary findings of the study were made available for the preparation of the New York and Addis Ababa documentation for the Special Session of the General Assembly. As members of Council are aware, final results were submitted to the last Regional Conference for Africa in Yamoussoukro under the title \"African Agriculture: the next 25 years\". In his opening address to the Council the Director-General reported on the endorsement by the Regional Conference of the study's findings. The Council is not called upon to consider in depth the findings of the study. However, it may be pertinent for me to recall the overall approach which was recommended by the Director-General in the form of a four-pronged Programme of Action. Of these four components, three depend on action by African countries. They are: 1. Changes in the structure of national economies, so that higher priority is given to agriculture. 2. Improvements in the four \"is\" of agricultural development-incentives, inputs, institutions, infrastructure 3. conservation strategy to ensure that ever-increasing pressures on natural resources do not result in irreparable damage to the environment. The fourth component depends on international action, and is defined as 4. Improving the external economic environment, through increased aid and better trading opportunities, so that Africa can earn its own way in the world. Within this broad framework, the Director-General has suggested-and the Regional Conference has agreed-that it would be useful to concentrate initially on building up agricultural production through the expanded use of inputs. The reason is simple. African agriculture has to grow 50 percent faster that in the past if serious food shortages are to be avoided in the future. This acceleration cannot be achieved expanding the limited reserves of suitable The bulk of additional production will therefore have to come from the use of modern technologies. These technologies are dependent on inputs of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, problems African countries constraints. The Conference consists of three complementary actions: expansion of aid-in-kind; enhancement of local production of inputs; and promotion of intraregional trade in inputs. The proposed study would focus on the feasibility of expanding the flow of aid-in-kind. There is nothing new about input aid as such: indeed fertilizer aid has been flowing in r ecent years at a rate of about a million tons of material per annum. However, it is now suggested that the time may have come to intensify such aid, and place A balanced approach of this nature has, I may add, been advocated recently by a number of public figures in countries. The primary of the proposed two-fold. Firstly, to determine likely input needs for the next years. Secondly, to role modalities for doing so. The main focus would be on Africa, but there is no logical reason why stepped-up input aid should be restricted to one continent. therefore a world-wide view, though dealing primarily with countries was favourable. Some first tentative contacts with industry have been made through FIAC, the FAO Fertilizer Industry Advisory Committee, and GIFAP, the Group of National Associations of Agro-Chemical Manufacturers. These, too, have been positive. The most important function of the Council, at the present stage, will be to give the donor representatives a chance to express their views-which, of course, we hope will be positive. I would like to assure both donors and recipients that there is no intention of proposing a new bureaucracy. We are be handled effectively by existing institutions, both bilateral and multilateral. In the case of FAO, for instance, we already have the Intern ational Fertilizer S upply Scheme, which ha s been running at a modest level in recent years but which has the capacity-demonstrated in the mid-seventies-to handle a large volume if the need arises. Agricultural requisites are often purchased under World Bank loans: would it not be an achievement if, as a result of efforts to systematize aid-in-kind, the same number of Bank dollars could buy a larger quantity of inputs? While I am advocating Council approval for the suggested feasibility study, I do not wish to convey any impression that we are under-estimating the difficulties, or taking an over-simplified view of the problems. It will be n ecessary, for instance, to look at the capacity of national delivery systems. We shall also have to be clear about the extent to which a higher level of aid-in-kind would be contrary-it would merely represent a shift from one type of aid to another. We shall aim to complete the study within twelve months, for submission to the Conference in November 1987. Further action would then be up to the Conference. An interim progress report would go to Council in June 1987. I would like to anticipate questions regarding the cost of the feasibility study. If it is to be carried out at all, it must surely be done properly-despite Organization's the provision in the Programme of Work and Budget for Contingencies-we are not asking for any special decision by the Council on the financial aspects of the exercise. Our best estima te of the tota l cost is $400 000. This allows for a number of country case studies. If the financial crisis were to worsen, we might be obliged to cut out the case studies. The value of the study would be reduced, but the cost would go down to about $200 000. The basic question before the Council is whether there is sufficient support the donor community to justify our the donor countries and programmes be ready to share with us their data on existing flows of aid in the form of inputs, to let us have information on the successes and problems they have encountered. We look to the donors also to give us their considered views on the possible advantages and disadvantages of stepping up the level of aid in this form. Participation in the study, and I would like to be quite clear about this, does not at all imply a commitment to participate in any arrangements to They, and developing countries from other regions, may now have some further thoughts that would help us to arrive at a decision. No one imagines that stepping up aid-in-kind is going, by itself, to produce miracles in African food production-or in solving the problems of other food-deficit areas. On the other hand, it is also clear that the long-term food problems of Africa are not going to be solved without the adoption of more intensive methods of production. This means more advanced technology, and more advanced technology requires inputs: in the present state of agricultural science, there is no viable alternative. So arrangements to step up aid-in-kind could be a spearhead. -263- Increased aid-in-kind would need to be closely associated with other measures. I am thinking particularly of the other components of our overall programme of action, including policies to give higher priority to agriculture, and measures to strengthen the three \"is\": incentives, institutions and infrastructure. Input flanked by the suggested arrangements, which I mentioned a few minutes ago, for enhancing the local production of inputs, and for promoting trade in inputs within the region. Within a total picture of some complexity, we believe it is essential to concentrate on one straightforward problem of basic importance. We hope there will be a consensus on the desirability of launching the proposed feasibility study of stepping up aid, and we look forward to hearing the reactions of the Council. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie Monsieur le Directeur general adjoint de prendre claire et efficace. Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Democratic Republic of) (original language Arabic): I also would like to thank the Deputy Director-General for his very clear presentation. I would like to express the appreciation of my delegation for the interest that the international community has shown in the economic recovery of Africa through a series of measures and meetings and arrangements crowned by the decision of the General Assembly S-13/2 by which the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986 to 1990 was adopted. I would like to express our appreciation to the Director-General of FAO who ever since the beginning of the crisis, and even before it worsened, continued his efforts to provide an incentive for the General Assembly to convene its special session for Africa and, last but not least, the fact that FAO followed up the activities of the special session as well as its technical experience reflected in the documents of this session. The main thrust of this session can be summarized under one heading: agricultural development is the primary force for longer term economic recovery and development in Africa. I would like to refer to document CL 90/21 concerning the in-depth study for agricultural and food problems in Africa. The document referred to the study submitted by the Director-General to the 14th African Regional Conference in September 1986 in Cete d'Ivoire under the title: African Agriculture: the Next Twenty-Five Years. The document summarized the main points of the study, which have shown the sound analysis and vision of the African crisis. The sugge stions in this study show a positive approach for achieving agricultural recovery and development in Africa. I would like to refer here to the contents of paragraph 29 of the document concerning the stepping up of aid-in-kind. We agree with the analysis of the document concerning the use of agricultural inputs as a primary factor in increasing production. The decisive factor in this is foreign currencies, which are very limited in Africa. I would also like to refer to paragraphs 40 and 41 concerning the adoption of the aforementioned Conference of the suggestions of the Director-General and entrusting him to carry out this study. Here we suggest that the Council give a mandate to the Director-General to carry out the feasibility study in order to step up aid-in-kind in the form of agricultural inputs. We also agree with the approach suggested by the Director-General and general directions contained in the feasibility study and we hope that they will agree to participate in it. Since the determining factor in the use of inputs in a great many low income food-deficit developing countries is the limited availability of foreign currency, we suggest that the study be extended to all countries facing problems in the supply of these inputs. We hope that the Council will agree to this. V\u00e0clav DOBES the facts characterizing the critical economic situation in Africa. The Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Africa held at the turn of May and June of this year was devoted to a broad consideration of the consequences and manifestations of the critical situation in Africa, chronic infections, a multitude of negative economic problems, such as slow growth of the gross domestic product, the deep drop of agricultural output in a number of developing evaluation of the results of the UNGA Special Session in a joint statement. -264- The concluding document of the UN General Assembly Special Session S-13/2 gives a concrete outline of the basic programmes and projects for the development of Africa in 1986-90\u00b7 But th e elimination of the critical situation in Africa and the securing of its long-term balanced and stable development must be approached in a broader context than that covered by this document. The solution of the problems of African countries must be linked as closely as possible with economic decolonization, with the of racism and apartheid , with the restructuring basis, the establishment of a new international economic order and the strengthening of universal peace and the creation of international economic security, the concept of which consists in the adoption of set of measures aimed at a radical improvement of the economic relations among countries along with the establishment of political guarantees of security and economic stability. The experience gained so far shows that partial measures in the solution of the economic situation in Africa merely mitigate the acute problems of the African continent and, from the long-term point of view, only postpone their solution indefinitely. As long as the current neocolonialist system of exploitation reflecting the unequal status of the developing countries in the international division of labour is maintained, and as long as the current unequal international economic relations are not restructured on a just and democratic basis, there will not be created the prerequisites for a comprehensive, principled and just solution to the critical situation in the continent of Africa. Today's critical situation in Africa must not be resolved at the cost of conditions relating to the independent and secure development of the African countries in the future. We are of the view that particularly in the consideration of the economic situation in Africa there arises the need for such an approach which will guarantee genuine security in the economic, military, as well as political fields. At the thirteenth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly we witnessed a moderate attitude of many countries on a number of fundamental issues relating to solution of economic problems of developing countries, notably African ones. We are aimed against the neocolonialist predatory policy and of international economic solution poverty, but also condemns African countries to a yet more inferior status and represents another source of their political liability. Surely the fact need not be emphasized here that the pursuit of a policy aimed at creating tension and mistrust in international relations will have an immediate negative impact on the economic sphere. It is n ecessary to keep constantly in mind the interdependence of peace, disarmament and development. This interdependence applies fully also in Africa which is relentlessly being afflicted by economic, military and political instability and by the consequences of apartheid. Ever more inexorable is the burden of military expenditures of individual countries which are ever more deeply drawn in the arms race. The growth of the volume of financial funds spent on military purposes generated by world imperialism has a negative impact on the standards of living in the individual African countries and hampers the solution of their social and economic problems, including food and health related ones and others In the various aspects of utilization of external sources to overcome the critical situation underestimated the irreplaceable role played by genuine foreign aid, be it in the humanitarian, economic or other fields Such aid, however, must be granted under just conditions and must not become a means of political and economic dictate and the underpinning of an imperialist neocolonialist policy. In have and mutually advantageous co-operation with the African countries on both a multilateral and bilateral basis. At this year's Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly we published the whole extent of our assistance. In granting it, we have always proceeded and shall continue to proceed from our economic possibilities and the nature of the tasks facing our economy. We have granted, and also in the future we shall continue to grant, assistance in the awareness that we bear neither historical nor current responsibility for situation in Africa. shall continue to provide extensive political, as well support. The Czechoslovakian delegation would like to emphasize that the comprehensive solution to the situation in Africa is a task that is closely related to the demand for an equitable restructuring of economic relations within the framework of the world division of labour. The assertion of equitable economic relations receives the unequivocal the senseless frenzy of armaments. That is also the path leading to a just and effective solution to the current situation in the African countries. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n ha estudiado con bastante cuidado y dedicaci\u00f3n el documento sobre el estudio a fondo de los problemas agr\u00edcolas y alimentarios en Africa. El Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica de Cuba ha seguido siempre muy de cerca la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n que viene atravesando desde a\u00f1os el continente africano y particip\u00f3 muy activamente en el per\u00edodo extraordinario de sesi\u00f3n de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas sobre la cr\u00edtica situaci\u00f3n de -265- Africa. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n ha analizado con sumo inter\u00e9s los documentos que nos presenta la Secretar\u00eda de la FAO para el an\u00e1lisis de este tema, que fue muy acertadamente presentado por el se\u00f1or Walton. Queremos, antes de comenzar a hacer un an\u00e1lisis del documento y de la situaci\u00f3n africana, felicitar al Director General por estos documentos, estas ideas y esta estrategia del desarrollo para Africa. Consideramos que ha sido muy acertada la intenci\u00f3n de tratar de centrar la atenci\u00f3n de toda la Comunidad Internacional en forma completa e integrada en los problemas y retos que la cuesti\u00f3n de la rehabilitaci\u00f3n del desarrollo a mediano y largo plazo plantea a los pa\u00edses africanos. El hecho de que todos tratemos de lograr los mejores resultados para el continente africano, es una muestra m\u00e1s de la gran preocupaci\u00f3n existente por el pr\u00e1ctico deterioro de la actividad econ\u00f3mica en Africa, cuya manifestaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s evidente es la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y alimentaria en el continente y como resultado de la cual ha aumentado de forma alarmante el n\u00famero de personas expuestas al hambre, la malnutrici\u00f3n e, incluso a la inanici\u00f3n, en tanto que en otras regiones del mundo o se almacenan o se destruyen alimentos para mantener sus precios en el mercado Asimismo la grave situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica internacional que contin\u00faa afectando adversamente a los pa\u00edses en desarrollo, ha tenido particularmente un efecto devastador sobre las zonas, sobre las ya fr\u00e1giles econom\u00edas africanas, manifest\u00e1ndose en el deterioro de las relaciones del intercambio, en la fuerte disminuci\u00f3n de los ingresos por concepto de exportaciones, en la fuerte carga de la deuda externa y en una corriente de recursos externos no sufientes para las necesidades de los pa\u00edses africanos. La delegaci\u00f3n cubana reitera que la responsabilidad de la humanidad con el continente africano es total y especialmente de aquellos que tienen una gran responsabilidad hist\u00f3rica con el atraso de este continente al que sometieron a siglos de explotaci\u00f3n y saqueo de sus valiosos recursos naturales y a pr\u00e1cticas de colonialismo, racismo y apartheid . No satisfechos con esta triste historia, mantienen actualmente asediados a pa\u00edses que han elegido su propia l\u00ednea de gobierno, apoyando acciones vand\u00e1licas y retr\u00f3gradas y medidas de desestabilizaci\u00f3n, especialmente en el Cono Sur africano. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n apoya todas las acciones que se tomen para solucionar la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y alimentaria del continente africano, lo cual incluye, como es l\u00f3gico, la rehabilitaci\u00f3n de su agricultura, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n instamos al cumplimiento de las resoluciones que han sido aprobadas por las Naciones Unidas en favor de la independencia incondicional de Namibia que es otro pa\u00eds africano que necesita, merece y debe ser libre para poder desarrollarse por sus propias fuerzas. Creemos, se\u00f1or Presidente, en la necesidad de entablar un di\u00e1logo constructivo entre donantes y los pa\u00edses afectados, a fin de elaborar un criterio conjunto teniendo presente las caracter\u00edsticas y problemas concretos de cada pa\u00eds, sin injerencias internas. Como ya hemos expresado en otros foros, reiteramos que Africa es una reserva inagotable de inteligencia, pericia y energ\u00eda y, consecuentemente, no necesita que desde fuera se le trate de dictar c\u00f3mo manejar su propio destino. Africa m\u00e1s bien requiere que se eliminen las trabas que impiden su desarrollo integral que son, entre otras, el intercambio desigual, las barreras proteccionistas, las po l\u00edticas financieras y monetarias leoninas y, en general, que se ponga fin al sistema de relaciones econ\u00f3micas injustas que le fueron impuestas al igual que al resto de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Consideramos imprescindible tambi\u00e9n que se brinde la asistencia t\u00e9cnica y financiera indispensable en cantidades suficientes para lograr la rehabilitaci\u00f3n de los sectores agr\u00edcolas y ganaderos de los pa\u00edses afectados como condici\u00f3n indispensable para la recuperaci\u00f3n social y humana de esos pa\u00edses. Creemos que es necesario hablar de recuperaci\u00f3n social y humana y no s\u00f3lo de recuperaci\u00f3n f\u00edsica. Estamos seguros de que sus gobiernos no solamente dar\u00e1n un hecho eficaz a esos recursos, sino que tal y como lo est\u00e1n haciendo, aportar\u00e1n contribuciones nacionales indispensables para que la asistencia y la cooperaci\u00f3n de la comunidad internacional produzca los mejores resultados. Esto ya lo discutimos en la pasada Conferencia Regional Africana y el compromiso surgi\u00f3 espont\u00e1neo. Estamos convencidos tambi\u00e9n da que al hacer frente a las necesidades cr \u00edticas de los pa\u00edses africanos, existen muchas \u00e1reas en que la FAO puede desempe\u00f1ar una importante funci\u00f3n tanto en la movilizaci\u00f3n de loe recursos necesarios como en la realizaci\u00f3n de actividades espec\u00edficas en la planificaci\u00f3n, reestructuraci\u00f3n y reforma agraria que necesitan esos pa\u00edses. Quisiera expresar en tal sentido la complacencia de mi delegaci\u00f3n por la forma en que se est\u00e1 llevando a cabo la labor de la FAO en favor de la rehabilitaci\u00f3n de la agricultura africana en estrecha coordinaci\u00f3n con loe gobiernos de los pa\u00edses necesitados y que claramente se expresa en este documento CL 90/21. Todas estas acciones, se\u00f1or Presidente, pueden hacerse con m\u00e1s agilidad y m\u00e1s precisi\u00f3n si no estuviese presente la guerra que han emprendido algunos pa\u00edses contra el multilat\u00e9ralismo incluyendo sus esfuerzos por reducir al sistema de las Naciones Unidas y por someter a la FAO a una crisis irreversible. Esto ha tomado mucho tiempo a este Consejo; es una prueba evidente que hemos discutido sobre los problemas que nos plantean ciertas pol\u00edticas m\u00e1s que sobre el desarrollo de nuestras -266- actividades para que la FAO cumpla con su mandato en la comunidad internacional. Igualmente, se\u00f1or Presidente, no debemos olvidar que para resolver la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en la regi\u00f3n africana, junto con los acuciantes problemas de la alimentaci\u00f3n y la agricultura, no bastar\u00eda con la concesi\u00f3n de recursos de emergencia, de naturaleza eminentemente coyunturales, sino dedicar los mayores esfuerzos a la reactivaci\u00f3n de un di\u00e1logo internacional, repetimos, coherente e integral, que al enalt ecer la cooperaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica internacional cree las condiciones que faciliten la reestructuraci\u00f3n del injusto y desigual orden econ\u00f3mico internacional vigente. Debemos reconocer la necesidad de efectuar las reformas internas que realicen la interacci\u00f3n de la justicia social y que hagan de Africa no un mero espectador, sino un protagonista del proceso de desarrollo de su regi\u00f3n y del mundo en que viven. Es necesario poner atenci\u00f3n a las necesidades b\u00e1sicas inmediatas, pero es imprescindible, insis timos, la rehabilitaci\u00f3n y desarrollo integral del continente africano; y esta colaboraci\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Presidente, y se\u00f1ores miembros del Consejo, como expresaba nuestro Ministro de Colaboraci\u00f3n en la Asamblea General sobre Africa, debe ser ofrecida desinteresadamente, sin pedir nada a cambio ni en t\u00e9rmino econ\u00f3mico ni en t\u00e9rmino pol\u00edtico. As\u00ed entendemos nosotros lo que es la ayuda. El estudio de viabilidad propuesto, para que sea elaborado por la FAO, puede ser un elemento de gran validez. Este estudio cuenta con el apoyo de nuestra delegaci\u00f3n. Apoyamos espec\u00edficamente la estrategia del p\u00e1rrafo 16 hacia la agricultura. Igualmente, el p\u00e1rrafo 17 es muy elocuente en cuanto a la necesidad del estudio y del compromiso de los estados africanos en asignar del 20 al 25 por ciento de las inversiones a la agricultura. El p\u00e1rrafo 29 tiene validez, y aunque se crea el aporte de insumos y de especies sea una ayuda inmediata, para nosotros constituye en s\u00ed un apoyo estrat\u00e9gico para que los programas de ajustes puedan mantener el ritmo de desarrollo que est\u00e1n llevando a cabo en algunos pa\u00edses. No nos resta m\u00e1s que expresar que apoyamos las medidas propuestas por la FAO, as\u00ed como el estudio que se presenta, y felicitamos una vez m\u00e1s al Director General por esta acci\u00f3n de apoyo al continente africano. Dong QING SONG (China) (Original language Chinese): Last May, the United Nations General Assembly held a Special Session on the critical economic situation in Africa and adopted the action programme of UN for the economic recovery and development of Africa from 1986-1990. This demonstrates the grave economic situation in Africa and reflects the serious preoccupation and great importance which the entire world expresses in the light of this situation. The task which the international community has before it is to implement the Action Programme for Africa. We are very happy to see over the last few years that a large number of African countries have made praiseworthy efforts in seeking solutions geared to the recovery and development of their economy, particularly in the agricultural food production sectors. They have taken positive steps to realize the objectives defined in the Lagos Plan of Action, in the Harare Declaration and in the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa. At the same time, the International community has provided a considerable quantity of aid, including emergency food aid, to the African countries in an attempt to help them promote their agriculture and food production. Once again this year the FAO has undertaken most useful activities to help the African countries in their attempt to control locust and grasshopper invasions, all of which activities have been a most positive contribution to the development of agricultural production in Africa and to the relief of the serious consequences of natural disasters. The Government and the people of China would like to express their solidarity with the African countries as they have to deal with the challenge of rehabilitating their economic development. Our country, both multilaterally and bilaterally, has provided economic and technical assistance and food aid to Africa. In order to help the African countries to control the locust invasion, this year our country has twice supplied through the intermediary of FAO 50 tonnes of pesticides to the African countries. Although the aid of our country in modest because of our own limited capacity, our country will nevertheless actively participate in economic and technical cooperation with Africa, both multilaterally and bilaterally, in support of the imp lementation of the African Programme of the United Nations. The Chinese delegation has studied with much interest the proposal of the Director-General in document CL 90/21 on a feasibility study based upon aid-in-kind assistance, listened with great attention to Mr Walton's presentation of these the aid-in-kind assistance programme is presented against the background of the Regional Conference for Africa, its significance, in fact, is to be understood as universal. As we all know, the provision of aid-in-kind assistance in soft terms could would, therefore, constitute an important factor in the solution of the food and agriculture problem. -267- The Chinese delegation supports the FAO in undertaking a feasibility study, upon that basis so that Council may examine this matter in greater depth and make a decision. LE PRESIDENT: Avant parole mesure du possible, nous paid to the FAO and the Deputy Director- General for his clear introduction of the paper. As has already been said by previous speakers, the study African Agriculture: The Next 25 Years was carried out at the request of the 13th FAO Regional Conference for Africa which met in Harare in 1984 with the specific object of discovering the root causes of the African food crisis. The 14th Regional Conference for Africa which met at Yamoussoukro found the study very balanced, very valuable and comprehensive. The findings of the study were in accord with the Africa priority programme for economic recovery 1986-1990. The Conference concluded that the study should be followed up. I will not repeat here the findings of the study which have been stated quite clearly. I will move on to the question of aid-in-kind. The study made it clear that most countries in Africa can only reverse their decline in food production through substantially greater use of production inputs, especially fertilizers, pesticides, many countries cannot allow them to import these vital inputs. The concept of aid-in-kind could appropriately fill this gap. As reported in paragraph 29 of the document before us, the advantages of this concept of aid-in-kind are many. It may be noted that it played a significant role in the launching of Asia's green revolution. In recalling the sentiment of the 13th FAO Regional Conference for Africa, my delegation wishes to endorse the aid-in-kind. However, I should like the study to be limited to agriculture in Africa for the time being as the paper is, in fact, concerned with the food crisis in Africa. This makes sense also because of the present financial crisis of the Organization. I should also like to mention here that my delegation welcomes of by Programme, initially for twenty African countries, six of which have had their programmes approved, is in line with the sentiments which we have already expressed in connexion with the crisis in Africa. In the same vein, we welcome the creation of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development embodying countries of the Eastern Africa region to combat drought and desertification. This body will need inte rnational support also in order to strengthen the efforts of African countries in the region to feed themselves. With these few remarks we support the study. l'introduction claire et compl\u00e8te qu'il nous a faite de la question importante qui nous pr\u00e9occupe actuellement et a fait la R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et Pr\u00e9sident du CILSS, pr\u00e9occupations, notamment dans toutes les instances de la la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation tunisienne souhaiterait faire quelques commentaires a un rele primordial dans le redressement de la r\u00e9gion. Il en d\u00e9coule \u00e9videmment rele de la FAO en tant qu'institution sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e des Nations Unies dans la contribution pr\u00e9cises en sens la 14\u00e8me Conf\u00e9rence mois logique dans le but essentiel de stimuler la production agricole. Il nous (Japan): I should first like to refer to the United Nations Special Session on Africa in May this year. It was the first time in the history of the United Nations that a special session was devoted to the economic problems of one continent. Japan, which felt the most profound sympathy for Africa, played an active role in the Special Session, and particularly welcomed the unanimous adoption of the efforts of the African countries, and for international support for those effort. It is important and encouraging that the countries of Africa confirm in the programme that the primary-responsibility for the development of the continent rests with them. It would seem clear that there could be no need to stress the fact that, in order to solve Africa's food problems, it is essential for those African countries, which have suffered from food shortages, to by giving the very highest policy priority to development in the food and agricultural sector and to implement programmes and measures accordingly. self-help efforts of the African countries. Si nce the fiscal year of 1977 Japan, in its bilateral ODA, had been promoting \"aid for food production\", which provides and machinery. In recent years, for food production has been increasing steadily. The amount of such aid by Japan in the fiscal year 1983/84 and 1985 was 32. 5 b illion yen, 34. 5 billion yen, and 38 billion yen, respectively. With regard to a feasibility study on \"stepping up aid-in-kind\", proposed by the I consider very to undertake such a study and carry out assessments of probable needs in areas and countries concerned. We have no objection to the carrying out of such a study in the African region within the present available resources of the Organization. In undertaking the study of agricultural input needs, we should get better results if a clear distinction is made between food production uses and other agricultural production uses and also if emphasis is made on the need for food production uses. We hope the result of this study can provide both multilateral and bilateral donors and recipient countries concerned with a kind of framework harmonizing international action. Philippe PIOTET (France): La delegation les du milliard dans ces conditions, le d'augmentation de la production \u00e9gard des orientations retenues par les plus responsables des africains. Lors de la session sp\u00e9ciale de l'Assembl\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Nations Unies, la France, dans ce r\u00e9alisation de perdre de vue, comme l'a fait observer M. en que d\u00e9veloppement agricole et elle a mis en lumi\u00e8re les points en raison de tout ce qui a nos est la sienne au concert des nations. Ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation estime que le Programme d'action des Nations Unies pour redressement de 64, 4 pour cent de ce programme, qui fait une place importante au secteur et le ressort la r\u00e9solution prise par mon chef d'Etat en juillet 1985 de consacrer de 20 \u00e0 ressources publiques au secteur de Etats. L'agriculture africaine, comme le confirme l'\u00e9tude de FAO, les 25 prochaines ann\u00e9es est le moteur que la communaut\u00e9 internationale une assistance massive sur la base 9 aujourd'hui est s\u00e9curit\u00e9 souhaitons d\u00e9marche \u00e9laboration les experts africains et appuyer l'analyse par une approche par pays et sous-r\u00e9gion. Le document principal et ses annexes ont re\u00e7u Niger, d\u00e8s le mois de mars, en formant plus de 3 000 brigades villageoises et nous sommes, en ce moment, ce qui et d\u00e9fense de nos int\u00e9r\u00eats. Toute aide volet agricole du Programme studied very carefully the document CL 90/19, together with document CL 90/21. The first document CL 90/19 is a report on the FAO Follow-up of United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa. The document has also tried to bring FAO's role Council should record its appreciation to the FAO Director-General and his staff for the active part they have played in the preparation of both the New York paper and the African paper. This is what it ought to be because from the very beginning there was a clear realization and a recognition that agricultural development is the main agent for recovery of development in Africa. Let me now turn to document CL 90/21, this also does not call for a long debate because many delegates who are in this hall were debating the same issues at the Fourteenth Regional Conference for Africa in Yamoussoukro only a couple of months ago and nothing much has changed since then. In fact, the main purpose of this document, as clearly stated at paragraphs 42 to 49, is to seek the Council's mandate for the Director-General to carry out a feasibility of aid-in-kind. The Zambian delegation wishes to give full support to the request by the Fourteenth Regional Conference for the Director-General to undertake a feasibility study on the practicability of aid-in-kind. The study should initially be conducted in Africa and it could be extended to other regions in due course. My delegation agrees with and supports Director-General's increased aid-in-kind to the African countries, as 44 of document CL 90/21 puts it \"Increased aid-in-kind could play a major role in the implementation of the second and fourth points of the Director-General's strategy\", popularly known as the four \"i's\" of agricultural development. The stepping up of the aid-in-kind in areas like fertilizers and seed cleaning and the process equipment would have an immediate impact on agricultural development in the region. The other areas, such as herbicides and veterinary medicines, and drugs, received which not suitable to their local situation. These points should be taken into account in the Director-General's study on the logistics and the effectiveness of the stepped up aid-in-kind in Africa. The African Ministers of Agriculture requested this study, and it is thus proper and appropriate that the Director- General be given the mandate to go ahead. Due to the importance my delegation attaches to we would propose workshops and expert consultations on this matter be held early next year. Thereafter the experts from both the donor community and the African sub-continent should meet to determine logistics and what could work. Of course, experts from other developing countries and institutions such as IFAD could be included in these dialogues. The preliminary report on the issue should be submitted to the ninety-first session of the Council for consideration. I need not repeat that Africa is ravaged by famine, poverty and under-development. Our salvation lies in increased food production and I maintain that the four \"is\", inputs, incentives, infrastructure and institutions provide the answer. aid-in-kind, if it were executed, could tremendously help African rural populations in enhancing their agricultural production. Finally, as we discuss issues, we should always Our programme to already one has passed. History and mankind w ill judge us we a Ramon LOPE -PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): Felicitamos a, la Secretar\u00eda por la preparaci\u00f3n del documento y al Doctor Walton por la excelente introducci\u00f3n que nos hizo esta ma\u00f1ana. La delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico le ha otorgado y le otorga un apoyo irrestricto y solidario a Africa. En ese contexto apoyamos firmemente el estudio propuesto por la FAO y su plan de Acci\u00f3n para contribuir a -272- resolver los problemas agr\u00edcolas y alimentarios en la region africana y, en particular, la posibilidad de que se otorgue mayor ayuda en especie que contribuya al desarrollo agr\u00edcola de los pa\u00edses receptores. Consideramos que un estudio dirigido a la inclusion de este tipo de ayuda en especie, debe analizarse y proyectarse cuidadosamente conforme a las caracter\u00edsticas de cada pa\u00eds y su regi\u00f3n y conforme a los aspectos que mejor se adapten a su estrategia de seguridad alimentaria. M\u00e9xico considera por tanto, que deben cuidarse los siguientes criterios: que el estudio propuesto no duplique otros estudios en marcha y, en todo caso, que se integre a ellos. Que la transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda impl\u00edcita en la disponibilidad de insumos agr\u00edcolas se estudie en sus consecuencias a fin de evitar que se genere mayor dependencia y se optimice el aprovechamiento de insumos nacionales o regionales. El papel de las empresas transnacionales debe por tanto merecer toda la atenci\u00f3n. Que se adapte el uso de tales insumos a las caracter\u00edsticas de cada zona y a los planes nacionales de desarrollo. Que la inclusi\u00f3n e incremento de la ayuda en especie no conlleve a la disminuci\u00f3n de la ayuda alimentaria bilateral o multilateral, sino que se adicione a ella; que tal ayuda en especie se pueda extender por plazos suficientes para hacerla efectiva. Coincidimos con las conclusiones b\u00e1sicas del estudio presentado por la FAO sobre Africa, las recomendaciones y acuerdos de la 14 a Conferencia Regional de Africa y la sesi\u00f3n especial de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas para Africa. Pedimos, pues, al Director General de la FAO que realice ese estudio como se propone en los p\u00e1rrafos 42 y 48 con las caracter\u00edsticas que hemos citado. Sabemos, como se recoge en el documento, que muchas de las decisiones y acciones est\u00e1n en manos de los propios pa\u00edses africanos y les sugerimos que le den prioridad a la reforma agraria y a los cambios estructurales propuestos. Hemos escuchado aqu\u00ed interesantes y trascendentes expresiones en ese sentido. Como bien se observa en el documento, Africa requiere de la asistencia externa para lograr resultados satisfactorios en su empe\u00f1o. Exhortamos a la Comunidad Internacional a que ampl\u00ede los cauces de la ayuda y de la asistencia destinadas a Africa a fin de consolidar un proceso de desarrollo que solamente el tiempo y un esfuerzo permanente puede llevar a resultados s\u00f3lidos concretos. La asistencia financiera y t\u00e9cnica externa es indispensable, sobre todo para que con este apoyo, con la ayuda en especie, se llegue al nivel requerido para producir en Africa los alimentos y no s\u00f3lo para cubrir pasajeramente las necesidades que por ahora son cr\u00f3nicas. Apoyamos, y lo reiteramos de nuevo, la ampliaci\u00f3n de la ayuda en especie y la cooperaci\u00f3n mayor de los pa\u00edses industrializados para otorgarla dentro de un plan bien estructurado que permita alcanzar las metas de desarrollo. Algunas delegaciones han hecho menci\u00f3n a la conveniencia de que un estudio similar en vista del deterioro de la situaci\u00f3n de la seguridad alimentaria en otras regiones, se extienda hacia esas otras regiones. M\u00e9xico considera que eso podr\u00eda ser interesante, pero en la medida en que no distraiga ni los recursos ni la atenci\u00f3n prioritaria al continente africano. Nosotros consideramos que, inclusive, ese estudio para Africa podr\u00eda servir en su elaboraci\u00f3n y en su ejecuci\u00f3n para que una acci\u00f3n similar se extienda hacia otras regiones. Por tanto le solicitamos al Director General que en la medida de esta prioridad reconocida, nos pueda presentar en un futuro un extenso an\u00e1lisis hacia otras regiones. Mohd. Mazlan BIN JUSOH (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to welcome the report of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the critical and economic situation in Africa and we thank Mr Walton for his excellent introduction. We wholeheartedly support the programmes as proposed in the OAU's Africa priority programme of economic recovery, as it is fundamental to the dignified existence of the countries in Africa. The programme is testimony to the resolve end determination of the African nations themselves towards attaining the goal of self-reliance. It is only appropriate that agriculture be given top priority in the Perhaps the world has not braced itself regarding figures of financial commitments that are required for the implementation of the programmes. If the African nations themselves, despite the present difficult situation, are willing to mobilize up to 82. 5 billion dollars within the next five years there is no cause for the international community to balk at the mere sum of 9 billion dollars a year to help the continent recover fully the famine situation. The amount of billion dollars a As members of the international community it is our moral duty to give our fullest support to all efforts towards the recovery of Africa. Admittedly the road ahead is filled with difficulties, especially with regard to the current difficult economic problems by the nations Debt-servicing reported to amount and 24. 5 billion dollars yearly. Therefore for the African nations to mobilize up to 82. 5 billion dollars additional to these difficult commitments would appear to be a formidable, if not an insurmountable task. It is therefore of the utmost by and not merely prescribe conventional measures of austerity which can no longer be tolerated by these nations who have suffered severe reverses in the economic and food situation. My delegation is pleased to welcome the in depth study on food problems in Africa, as documented in CL 90/21. Indeed it is alarming to note that the conclusion of the study indicates a possible decline in per caput food production in the next 25 years. It is also anticipated that cerea l deficit will reach up to 100 million tons by the year 2010. Of course, importation of such an amount by the African nations themselves would be unthinkable in the face of the adverse economic situation that would prevail in the continent. Therefore we have no reservations whatsoever in supporting the Programme of Action proposed in the study, which stipulates that agriculture be given top priority. The four-point strategy as detailed in of agriculture-incentives, inputs, institutions and infrastructure-must be improved. We regard these measures as logical and pragmatic. Attention to programmes based on resource development and conservation of the environment is very appropriate due to the alarming rate of desertification and soil degradation that have taken place in a large part of Sub-Saharan Africa. The proposal to study aid-in-kind, especially in terms of inputs, such as fertilizers, agricultural etc, is fully supported by delegation. We consider such to strengthen the productive capacities of the farmers in the region, is logical and imperative. This is indeed consistent with our delegation's stand that aid should be concentrated in the field of food production rather on giving food. We possible ill effects on domestic producers of items which are to be given in this programme of aid-in-kind. Where possible it may be more plausible to produce the necessary inputs, such as fertilizers, in the soumis je voudrais intervenir bri\u00e8vement au nom de mon pays pour dire que nous estimons que l'aide en nature peut \u00eatre formule utilis\u00e9e qu'un stockage et des moyens communication et de transport.

E. The United States participated fully and listened attentively to both the United Nations Special Session on Africa and the recent FAO Regional Conference for Africa. Regarding the UN Special Session, we continue to believe that the role of the donor community is subsidiary to with African governments, the OAU, the UNDP, FAO and others, in seeking to solve African economic and social problems. The United States will focus its assistance on several of the highest priority areas cited in the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted at the Special Session, namely, economic restructuring, agricultural development, and human resources development. The achievement of economic and institutional reform by recipient countries is the centrepi ece of our assistance strategy. Agricultural development is a high priority and entails for agricultural and privatization, improvement in agricultural production, greater responsiveness to local and regional markets, better management of natural resources and drought preparedness. The United States will continue to support the development of Africa's human resources through support for programmes in the priority areas of training, child survival and family planning. The United States considers be of highest importance. In this respect, we encourage FAO to participate with the other United Nations Agencies in preparing for the 1988 Mid-Term Follow-up to the African Action Programme. -277- There is to duplicate the lengthy dialogue on FAO's excellent multi-volume study on agriculture which was debated just two months ago. Appropriate technology which small Some spare parts; for others it was fertilizers. We need to look at what are the drawbacks in individual small farmers'needs and adopt a flexible approach so that each person's needs are met. Document CL 90/21 requests us make two decisions: first, should feasibility study of stepping up input aid-in-kind; second, should the focus of study be limited to Africa? We believe the Director-General's proposal has some merit. The United States provides aid-in-kind to a number of countries. form and as farm equipment and spare parts. While inputs are important, they represent several constraints to agricultural growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. Incentives, initiative are other critical factors. Each country's needs are different. At the FAO regional conference for Africa several countries expressed the view that inputs alone would do very little towards an improved agricultural sector. We are concerned that an extensive study by FAO relating may divert attention away from coordinated programmes for agricultural development that we believe are critical. As noted by Mr. Walton in his introduction, we trust that FAO would utilize the facilities of the UNDP to effect our considerable debate week reduced budgetary resources, we are concerned that performing the study may reduce expenditures on other high priority programmes. An expense existing programmes. Despite our concerns over the cost of the study, the risk of over-emphasizing one component of a package of recommendations and producers and distributors of inputs, aid-in-kind appears to be an area where FAO could be an effective intermediary between potential donors and recipients. If there is strong Council support for FAO to undertake such a study, as it a ppears there will be, the United States is interested in participating, with the prior understanding that our willin gness to participate in no way suggests that we believe increased input of the United States may well come at the expense of other aid programmes. Finally, since the idea for this study emerged directly from the African study, we believe its focus should remain on Africa for the present time.

The documents under and clear. The Austrian agrees with the complementary the of local productional inputs and promotion of inter-regional trade in inputs. The proposed study should be worked out in close consultation with the African countries. And due attention should be given to livestock development, agro-forestry and inland fisheries. We we lcome and support in itiatives and action proposals of the Director-General. We hope that FAO will start immediately, or that we have available the first draft of this study during the Council meeting in June of next year. Austria fully supports the FAO contribution for Africa and ray country provides bilateral and multilateral aid to African countries and we shall continue to do so the future. Paul A. BOMANI (Tanzania): On behalf of the Tanzanian delegation I would like to thank the FAO Director-General, Dr. Saouma and his staff for undertaking the study of the root causes of the Food and Agriculture prices in Africa. I would also like to congratulate the Deputy Director-General, Mr Walton, for the excellent and precise introduction of the paper under discussion. Before discussing the paper I wish to highlight some background information. Forgive me, if in doing so I may appear to be repeating what has been said by other speakers, but I will do so only for one reason, and that is to emphasize the points already made. Many African countries have been experiencing famine year after year. These countries have been forced become net importers of grains. The main factors responsible for this situation can be put into two categories. Firstly, those which are beyond our control such as weather, lack of foreign exchange to import necessary inputs and equipment, and those within our control such as policy issues on pricing, marketing systems and availability of consumer items as incentive goods. Employment of low technology and our dependence on rainfed farming systems, has resulted in unpredicted low levels of production for both cash and food crops. This situation has been further complicated by the high rate of population growth in most of the African countries. The question that has been recurring in the minds of the heads of state and ministers of Agriculture in Africa has been what should be done to rectify the situation. The disastrous food and agricultural situation, led to heads of states and governments of the Organization of African Unity to adopt the Lagos Plan of Action in 1980 as the framework for a collective effort aiming at an economic and social reestablishment of the African countries. In other words, what you may call the structural adjustments\u00b7 As the objectives for the 1980/85 period the Lagos Plan of Action called for the immediate improvement of the basic conditions for gradual self-sufficiency fisheries and livestock -279- products. At the 21st Session of the Conference of Heads of States and Governments of the OAU, held in Addis Ababa between 8 and 20 July 1985, it was recognized and emphasized that Africa's principal economic sector and agriculture has seriously deteriorated over the last years. This came as a dramatic confirmation of the downward trend in production and productivity prevailing in the 1970s. was poor perfomance in agriculture. Not to mention the fact of political destabilization in the southern African states perpetrated by the apartheid regime in Pretoria. Nevertheless, lack technological approach and know-how further aggravated the downward trend of production. In the light of the above background, the ministers of agriculture at the 13th FAO Regional Conference held in Harare, in July 1985, requested the FAO to undertake an in-depth study of agriculture and food problems in Africa and to recommend the appropriate technology to overcome prevailing problems. At I like to express my deepest appreciation to the Director-General of the FAO, Dr Saouma, for his prompt response and action which resulted in completing the study within a very short time. The study was presented and discussed at the 14th FAO Regional Conference for Africa in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, where it was duly approved and endorsed by African ministers of agriculture. I was honoured to be present at that meeting. I was honoured to be appointed the reporter of the Regional Conference held in Yamoussoukro and, as a result, and perhaps because of this, I was closely associated with the feelings of the ministers, and with their deep sense of commitment to the concepts and the objectives of the programme presented by the Director-General. I assure you, members of this Council, that the study and the programme of action was highly recommended and then endorsed by all ministers at the Conference. Once again, my delegation fully endorses the findings of the study. The study is not only comprehensive, but has offered concrete suggestions which, if implemented, will help the African continent to utilize fully its potential in the production of food and export crops. Also, the programme of action proposed by the Director-General had the full support of the sourthern African delegation. As a matter of interest, we should like to emphasize briefly four points of strategy to raise food production. The Director-General has given us the four \"I's\" as the main thrust of our objectives. It is a fact that the many developing countries have been getting aid for a number of years, but yet they have been at the centre of a food crisis. This proves that strategies which have been pursued, by those the recipient and donor countries, have not been tailored to answer problems which have been responsible for the low production. It is at this point that I strongly feel that action proposed by the Director-General will, in a great way, help to bring a positive return for investment and results Tanzanian to implement the proposed measures in the study. These include ensuring that the farmers are paid not less than 70 percent of the export price as one way of motivating the farmers. The agricultural sector is receiving the priority it deserves and, as a result, of the deliberate decision, the development budget is now to be channelled to the agricultural sectors up to 30 percent of total resources. The training of farmers is given due emphasis to ensure that they the world market prices have dropped by almost 50 percent. Here again the role of the United Nations agencies to participate fully emphasized. I would support very strongly the points made in this regard by the delegation of Czechoslovakia. This shows that the decision the developing nations, wheteher they like it or not. I wish to state here that the Tanzania agricultural production is growing at 2 percent per annum while the population growth is at 3. 3 percent per annum. This could be the question first of all of population growth vis-a-vis food production. Demand for agricultural inputs is much higher than we can s upply loca lly. There was a time when use of fertilizer was very unpopular; now it is the other way around. The demand for fertilizer has increased; the annual demand now is about 184 000 tonnes and this is very small compared with the potential of the market but smaller still when it is compared with the use of fertilizers in other agricultural producing countries. That being the case, we still have this unattainable situation where we are able to supply only 50 000 tonnes from local sources. Our demand for better seeds is about 30 000 tonnes a year. The capability of supplying seeds in the country is only 5 000 tonnes. That means the rest of the farmers go without better seeds simply because we cannot afford them. The demand for bags, a common commodity we use for transportation, is about 25 million pi eces a year. The s upply from local sources is about 7. 5 million bags. You look at another aspect of production factors and improvement, ploughs, tractors. I take tractors because they are not manufactured in Tanzania. We have a demand for 1 800 tractors a year, a very small number, but we can only supply from our resources 250 pi eces. It has been possible through aid-in-kind from friendly nations to obtain some tractors; well, although the number is very small. -280- The experiment in this aid-in-kind, already existing on a small scale in Tanzania, is a good example of what can be done if you are able to enlarge the supplies. The Tanzanian Government has prepared its three year economic recovery programme initiated this financial year. The programme requires about US$62 million to rehabilitate the agricultural sector and almost the same amount of funds to meet the inputs and agricultural equipment. This is not a frightfully big amount, but for Tanzania it is quite substantial. We need these funds for annual operations to be able to feed Tanzania. This brief account shows the little experience we have in Tanzania and indicates clearly that aid-in-kind package will and can help to revive our agricultural production. The background that I have given shows very clearly that the document before us, especially paragraph 45 on page 9, gives a note of caution maybe a rather timid approach to the whole idea. 45 begins that \"The proposed study would aim at providing questions so as to enable countries and institutions to decide on the expediency in an increase in aid-in-kind\" and then it goes on \"Should the study result in a consensus being reached in favour of such an increase, then, and only then, would it be appropriate to proceed with the preparations so we are proposing a feasibility study to change the status quo, because we know the road to status quo is the road to chaos. We cannot opt for no solution because no solution is the quick road to chaos. As far as I can see, the only viable action is really to achieve some changes to bring about growth. If science and technology are essential to achieving environmental control manipulation for betterment of life, then we have to seek transfer of technology. Agriculture in the United States is succesful partly because of the land grant univers ities and outreach programmes which serve the farmer. The Green Revolution in the Far East, and now Asia, has been brought about by the provision of better seed and fertilizers accompanied by better and modern techniques. Africa will continue begging for food if it is denied access to the inputs; if it is denied access to modern technology; if it is denied access to implements; if it is denied access to credit. The journey to African economic recovery has taken many routes, and still has a long way to go. The first fundamental rule on this journey is the very realization and acceptance of responsib ilities by our leaders, but we must face the stark reality that Africa cannot and will not overcome the scourge of famine and without first policy of changes in favour of agriculture. Secondly, Africa has the resources and great potential which have yet to be exploited, but you will not achieve this without removing the bottlenecks. Thirdly, to realize these objectives, Africa must reform, Africa must unleash productive forces and enthusiasm and energy towards agriculture. Finally, and it is stated in paragraph 16 of the document, Africa will and can su cceed if there is action by the international community in support of the programme. The African farmers must be supported to reverse the negative food production trends of the past. That is why we are here. That is why we have FAO. But we have become rather limited in our attitude because we have expected business as usual, \"If Africa does not have food we can send some grain and settle the temporary problem\" and that is it. This will not get us anywhere. This small planet of ours has become smaller because of modern communication. Modern communication has made it easier for us to communicate, but we have communication without a community. Even when we have a golden opportunity to create world community, world understanding for mutual interest, we allow barriers to stand in the way. Please let us not fail to realize what Africa is asking for. Africa is asking for knowledge to improve her capability to feed herself. We are seeking for the essentials of human needs. We want to work the land and produce what is needed. We cannot arrogate this responsibility to others. It is like we read in the Old Book. In the ancient days there was a young man called Joseph. He happened to be in Egypt at a time when the pharaoh of Egypt had a dream which was almost a nightmare, which perturbed him greatly, and he sought for interpretation of that dream, which unfortunately he had forgotten, and it was Joseph who decoded the dream and saved Egypt from impending disaster. Our puzzle today is clear: is Africa going to feed herself 20 years from now or face starvation? History repeats itself. If at that time Joseph was able to come up with an idea which saved Egypt, this Council should turn itself into a modem Joseph serving the OAU instead of the pharaoh and provide the answer to the problem facing Africa. We are asking Chip Council to interpret the African dream of the next 25 years.

Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Debemos comenzar por expresar nuestra satisfacci\u00f3n por la excelente preparaci\u00f3n y por la presentaci\u00f3n que de ella hizo el se\u00f1or Director General Adjunto ante esta Asamblea de los documentos CL 90/19 y CL 90/21. Expresamos nuestro apoyo al Programa de Acci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas en cuanto al objetivo de alcanzar un desarrollo m\u00e1s din\u00e1mico y la importancia que asigna a la funci\u00f3n de la mujer. No queremos desaprovechar la oportunidad que esta referencia nos brinda para recordar a este Consejo la vigencia que a este respecto tiene la Resoluci\u00f3n adoptada un\u00e1nimemente por nuestra Conferencia General de 1985 sobre la mujer en el medio rural, la cual solicita prestar atenci\u00f3n a la mujer campesina de los pa\u00edses subdesarrollados en v\u00edas de desarrollo en todos los programas do la FAO, y en este caso concretamente le corresponde a la mujer africana que debe merecer preferente atenci\u00f3n en el estudio a considerar para Africa, que apenas ha recorrido la primera etapa en el camino de su verdadera liberaci\u00f3n del colonialismo. Para que sea una emancipaci\u00f3n completa, para que la soberan\u00eda de las naciones africanas sea a plenitud es necesario que se haga efectiva su emancipaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica; es en el plano econ\u00f3mico en el cual puede valorarse la verdadera independencia de los pueblos y es hacia este fin al cual consideramos nostros que se dirige el Programa de Acci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas y m\u00e1s especialmente el estudio que sobre Africa propone la FAO referente a la producci\u00f3n de alimentos b\u00e1sicos y en el campo de la agricultura, y cuando decimos agricultura estamos tambi\u00e9n incluyendo la pesca y la ganader\u00eda. Pero, a\u00fan m\u00e1s, como bien lo plantea el se\u00f1or Director General en este documento CL 90/21, dicho Programa ser\u00eda mayormente efectivo puesto que ya se ha demostrado que no basta la ayuda alimentaria per se , sino que es indispensable ayudar a los pa\u00edses a incrementar y desarrollar su propia producci\u00f3n de alimentos y por ello es indispensable la ayuda en especie. Como lo expone el documento en sus p\u00e1rrafos 15 y 16 deber\u00edamos hacer efectiva la estrategia de cuatro puntos denominada las cuatro \"\u00edes\" propuesta por nuestro Director General. Para cumplir con la solicitud de la Conferencia Regional Africana que pide a este Consejo un mandato para realizar el estudio de factibilidad propuesto por el Director General queremos expresar nuestro pleno apoyo a tal solicitud, manifestando al mismo tiempo nuestro respaldo a la sugerencia de que tal estudio se extienda a otros continentes los cuales arrastran una vida de pobreza cr\u00edtica degrandes masas humanas que n ecesitan ayuda. A estos pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo el Programa de Ayuda en Especie en forma de insumos agr\u00edcolas les ser\u00eda completamente necesario. -283- Debemos tambi\u00e9n respaldar la propuesta del Director General contenida en el p\u00e1rrafo 20 del documento CL 90/21 en cuanto a reformas institucionales referidas a la reforma agraria y a los servicios de capacitaci\u00f3n, investigaci\u00f3n y extensi\u00f3n, centradas principalmente en las necesidades del peque\u00f1o agricultor. Debemos recordar aqu\u00ed que en la Conferencia Regional de Barbados, la cual tuvo lugar en agosto de este a\u00f1o, el punto central fue la solicitud hecha al Director General de la FAO de un estudio de las condiciones econ\u00f3micas de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, lo cual fue aprobado por unanimidad. Lo que deseamos expresar aqu\u00ed es que ver\u00edamos con agrado que al realizar el estudio de viabilidad para Africa se tome en cuenta este hecho para incorporar, cuando se trate de extenderlo a otros continentes, el estudio de referencia, sobre todo con aquellos pa\u00edses que enfrentan problemas de abastecimiento. Resumiendo, queremos finalizar nuestra intervenci\u00f3n ratificando nuestro apoyo al documento, en el contenido del p\u00e1rrafo 46 y en consideraci\u00f3n al p\u00e1rrafo 48, con ayuda en especie; esperamos que as\u00ed como este estudio debe abarcar a todos los pa\u00edses, debe ser tambi\u00e9n considerado para lograr un consenso pleno. Y para terminar, nos pronunciamos por que este estudio se emprenda de inmediato a fin de que pueda ser presentado para su consideraci\u00f3n y aprobaci\u00f3n a la Conferencia de 1987. Tawfik A. H. AL MESH-MEDANI (Iraq) (Original language Arabic): I should like to express my delegation's satisfaction at the introduction of the documents under discussion. The two documents under are, indeed, of our appreciation, and I find document CL 90/21 on the in-depth study in Africa an appropriate one. It contains a clear outline and description of the situation. I should like to refer more specifically to the contents of paragraph 29 of the document and the reasons for increasing aid-in-kind. The analysis in this paragraph of the reasons for increasing this aid are valid ones. As to the means of undertaking the study, described in paragraphs 46 to these concerns the question whether we we agree to undertaking the feasibility study provided that it takes into account more specifically the needs of Africa and a countries which are also a policy, nevertheless we should like to point out that we would not accept any form of aid which would or discussion, that is documents CL 90/19 and CL 90/21, regarding African food and agriculture. Let me first of all congratulate Mr Walton on his excellent presentation. My delegation has studied the papers carefully and we find them quite comprehensive. For a long time we have been monitoring the active leading role of FAO in solving the agricultural problems in Africa. We have also witnessed the. Director-General's full attention on this matter. We arc of the view therefore, that FAO's contribution to African agriculture is not only significant but really commendable. The report on the In-depth Study of Agricultural and Food Problems in Africa is quite satisfying as far as my delegation is concerned. The Programme of Action for African agriculture, namely the four \"i's\" strategy, that is incentives, inputs, institutions and infrastructure, and expansion of aid-in-kind, should be regarded as wise approaches. With regard to the four points of strategy, my delegation is of the opinion that these are the right methods to foster food production. Similar strategies have been the key elements in the su ccess of Indonesian food production programmes which achieved self-sufficiency two years ago. The Government of Indonesia would welcome sharing its experience with other countries, especially in Africa. Taking into account in rice self-sufficency, a token contribution equal to about 100 000 tonnes of paddy rice was donated by the Indonesian farmers for the people who badly particularly Africa. -284- would like a political decision by the concerned Government to place the agriculture and food production programme as the main priority of its national development, followed by an appropriate pricing inputs such in the most appropriate way would be prerequisites for the su ccessful achievement of the programme. This would include the right provision of inputs in of time for the place, to food production development programmes would be of fundamental importance. With regard to the proposal for stepping up aid-in-kind, my delegation fully supports the Director-General's proposal for a further detailed study of the proposal, not only for the African region but also for other developing countries. My be developed in such a way not only in the framework of North/South cooperation but also in the scheme of the effectiveness of the assistance, it is my delegation's view that participation in the study of the concerned Government with the country under study is of great importance. Rainer PRESTIEN (Germany, Federal Republic of): As previous speakers have done, 1 should also like to associate myself with the statements in document CL 90/19. We welcome the presentation of FAO's follow-up of the UN General Assembly Special Session on the critical economic situation in Africa. Let me mention that the Federal Republic of Germany took an active part in the deliberations of this important session. We support the UN Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990, to which paragraphs 9 and 10 of the document refer. Africa has always been and continues to be one of the most important focal points in the Federal Republic of Germany's overall economic cooperation. The volume of our technical and financial cooperation with Africa from 1950 to 1985 amounted to DM 32.2 billion, approximately $16 billion according to the present exchange this period of time we increased the share of agriculture and rural development to more than 30 percent. This demonstrates the high importance we attach to this sector. My country has always recognized the moral duty to help mankind in need. With regard to the feasibility study proposed in the document, I refer to the statements which the distinguished representative of Belgium made in view of this item on behalf of the Commission of the European Communities. The Federal Republic of Germany will continue its fruitful development cooperation with Africa. In so doing we will attach special importance to rural development as we have done since the inception of our cooperation efforts thirty- six years EL SARKI (Egypt) (original language Arabic): Allow me, at the beginning of my statement , to express my deep thanks to Dr Walton for his clear introduction of documents CL 90/13 and CL 90/ 21, currently being examined by the Council. During the 13th Regional Conference for Africa we welcomed the proposal to undertake a study of agriculture and food problems in Africa. During the 14th Session of the Regional Conference the completed study was examined and Egypt expressed its full satisfaction with it. We welcomed more specially those items related to the development of human resources and the harnessing of the necessary financial resources for increased production. The Egyptian delegation wished to express its aimed at increasing aid-in-kind provided in inputs. This form of aid plays a vital role in increasing agricultural production. We, therefore, join other delegations in endorsing the proposal to request the Director-General to undertake a feasibility study on the possible volume of inputs. We would also like to seize this opportunity to stress the importance of the special programme for Africa currently being implemented by IFAD and fully supports. programme to those nations still the effects of drought and famine. Egypt attended the United Nations special session on revitallizing the African economy. There we expressed our full satis- -285- faction with decisions and measures resulting from that meeting. I would like to express my special support for what his Excellency the Minister of Agriculture of Tanzania stated at this morning's meeting, namely that the development of agriculture in Africa is first and foremost the duty of the sons of Africa and none other. Igor KIPMAN (Brazil): In connection with this subject I would like to say that the interests of my country in the overall development of the African nations and the ties which unite our peoples are well known and I need not elaborate at length about them. I will only mention that within the constraints imposed by financial difficulties some cooperation programmes are under way involving Brazil and African countries. Regarding the feasibility study demanded by the African Regional Conference, my delegation feels that all efforts should be undertaken by FAO to have it completed as that study will certainly be an important tool for the continent's integrated development. I, therefore, extend the support of my delegation to this project. I would like to recall that the 19th FAO Regional Conference for Latin America in the Caribbean, held last August in Barbados, also requested that a specific study be done to analyse the present crisis of Latin America and Caribbean agricultural economic situation as well as its implications on the long-term development of the region, in what pertains to food and agriculture. That request is stated in paragraph 20 of the report of that meeting. In this connection we would appreciate it if the Secretariat would take into consideration in that study the new concept of aid-in-kind as it comes to be dealt with in the feasibility study for Africa. I am, therefore, pleased to notice that some common aspects brevity's sake, I want to conclude by expressing the support of my delegation for the points raised by the distinguished delegate le son excellente du sujet dont nous d\u00e9battons.

AITKEN (United Kingdom): I would like to begin by welcoming you to leading our Council for the first time this Session. 1 think from your intervention this morning we all know you will be able to bring certainly the wisdom of Solomon to any judgements. We would like to thank the Deputy Director-General for his excellent introduction to this item. In common with a number of other countries we welcome the successful conclusion of the United Nations Special Session on Africa and the guidance given in the Plan of Action. There is now an impressive sense of purpose to develop solutions to African problems. This was a process started with the Lagos Plan of Action and continued with the Harare Declaration. The United Kingdom was privileged to attend the African Regional Conference as an observer. We were impressed by the determination and the commitment of African Ministers of Agriculture to take the difficult decisions necessary to increase agricultural production on the continent. It is good to hear today from the interventions of our African colleagues that this determination remains and has been reinforced. -888- At the Africa Regional Conference the United Kingdom observer made it clear that we consider that the FAO study \"African Agriculture: the next 25 years\" to be an excellent document. It is a comprehensive work and in our view one of the most successful and significant studies produced by FAO in the four \"i's\", incentives, input, institutions and infrastructure, is an excellent ideas. The emphasis on a conservation-based development and the recognition of the importance of population policies is in our view totally sound. However, it is the recognition of the need for appropriate policies which favour agriculture which gives this study its central strength and authority. We were thus pleased to see the Programme of Action proposed by the Director-General endorsed at the African Regional Conference. Turning now to the question of aid-in-kind, we welcome the recognition given to the role which can be played by what we call programme aid in. improving agricultural production. Our aid programme has included programme aid for some time now and indeed in r ecent years we have switched aid from project to programme aid, particularly in response to the problems in Africa. Where economic circumstances suggest it is an appropriate response we are always prepared to consider switching the forms of our aid to maximize its effectiveness. Our experience is that programme aid must be handled sensitively and flexibly if it is to su cceed. Programme aid for agriculture cannot be considered in isolation from activity in other economic sectors and national development plans. Turning now to the question of the feasibility study on the basis of the terms of reference given in CL 90/21, we have some reservations on the terms of reference but I am happy to say that in his comprehensive and detailed opening statement the Director-General has answered many of our questions and reassured us. We see this as a timely exercise to develop more effective forms and delivery systems for existing aid flows. In the light of Mr Walton's opening remarks, we now feel reassured that central to this study will be the recognition that the other three \"i's\" identified in the Africa study, infrastructure, incentives and institutions, have to be developed in parallel to enable countries to benefit from inputs. Here 1 would very much like to refer to and support the remarks made by the delegate of France in this aspect. We consider that the aid-in-kind In our view the country studies are essential if the overall study is to be a practical document pointing the way to help the farmer in the field. In the final analysis, programme aid is given on a country basis and it is tailored to the individual needs. We must hope that financial pressures will not lead to the dropping of these particular country studies and, in fact. we consider them to be very central. We hope the study will enable FAO to develop its capacity to advise countries help countries with problems of switching between different forms of aid with the readjustment of priorities this may require. We believe that Africa's problems are urgent and we consider, in common with a number of other delegations, that initially the study should be limited to Africa. Any proposal for expansion should be phased so that they can learn from experience in Africa. At the Regional Conference at Yamoussoukro, the United Kingdom indicated it would be pleased to share its experience with FAO and participate in-any study. I can confirm this and confirm that we endorse the proposals for the feasibility study as described by Mr. Walton and outlined in CL 90/21. Like many other delegates we would also like to stress that we hope that while concentrating on inputs, FAO will not lose sight of the need to provide assistance especially to African countries to enable them to develop the other three \"i's\". It remains the view of my Government that Africa should continue to programmes. attaches considerable importance to effective coordination of the effort to help Africa. We hope that FAO will continue its efforts to coordinate its activities with other established also However, we continue to have some reservations over the proposal to undertake a study of aid-in-kind. We are a little concerned rather examination of the administrative modalities for putting the scheme into operation. FAO has performed an invaluable service through its production of a comprehensive study on \"African Agriculture: the next 25 years\". Apart from the very thorough research that has clearly gone into this document one of its most welcome features was the attempt, a good one we think, to articulate the basis of a policy strategy, that priority agriculture, so-called for the importance of conservation and changes in the external economic environment. The strength of the African study lays in its analysis of the African situation and the challenges faced by African countries when dealing with it. These are first challenges policy devoted to the complexity of the issues and to the need for appropriate balance in the actions taken to address those issues. Obviously nobody can argue against the need for more readily available modern inputs in support of African Smallholders. The point is against what strategy would such shipments take place. As the delegate of the United States, as well as other delegates from the United Kingdom, France and Mexico, how can we be sure that balance will be preserved among the various priorities and programmes that may be Are inputs indeed a central catalyst, as they tend to be portrayed in the documents? Is there really a firm relationship between certain rates of growth in The briefly cited example of India in the 1960s, that is in document CL 90/21, is an interesting one, though we believe that many observers of the Indian experience agree that their success was primarily as a result of the determination and vigour of its policymakers as well as once again the application of an all-fronts approach. The recent successes in China have not been noted in document CL 90/21 and while obviously there are significant differences in the situation we are not aware that the availability of aid-in-kind has been a major factor. It was my privilege to have attended as an observer the Regional Conference at Yamoussoukro. At the Conference I recall a wide variety of opinions on the usefulness of this initiative-that is, relative to other priorities in the region, such as research, water conservation and technology transfer. Canada is only one donor in Africa. We are at once proud of our record yet fully aware that more must be done. In our fiscal year 1986/87 Canada anticipated that $900 million will be spent in the African region. The assistance is being allocated in various types and through a variety of channels. The configuration is a combination of what Canada is in a position to provide, what our African partners ask us to do, and what we both agree will have the highest impact for the resources available. We do detect an increased interest in programme aid and we have responded where this is mutally assessed to be feasible and cost effective. If Africa should approach us for programme aid in the form of agricultural inputs we would of course consider it. The important point to observe is that even in a context of generally increasing aid levels, as is the case in Canada, the of aid-in-kind would be most unlikely to involve additionality. It is a question of one type of aid over another type. Moreover, and contrary to the suggestion on page 7 of the English version of the Programme of Action, whether or not aid is provided in kind or not, it still must be financed from a limited official development a sssitance budget. Finally, we would ask two questions: first, is this really the time to be speaking of more tied aid, of moving back the cycle of dependency one notch from food aid to that of agricultural inputs; and secondly, in this particular time in the current international trade system, do we really want to open new opportunities for increases in subsidized the of reference for any study, if it is approved by this Council, to include an examination of national food and agricultural strategies as an initial step, followed by a consideration or appraisal of the role of programme aid in achieving the objectives of those strategies. We feel that this is a more logical and realistic approach than to initiate an accommodate it. M. Afzal QADIR (Pakistan): I w ill start by apologizing that 1 feel handicapped in my understanding of the subject matter under discussion by reason of the fact that I was late in arriving at this Council this morning when a statement, widely acclaimed and enthusiastically received, was made by the Director -General in launching the document and in kicking off the debate thereon. Judging by the number of participating in item attracted the serious attention it deserves. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate on behalf of my government that the suffering and the plight of the people of Africa is one that has struck the deepest chords of sympathy in the hearts of the people of Pakistan. We would wish, and it would be our sincere hope, that the African problem would be a short-lived one, so that the valiant people of Africa would be able to resume their endeavors towards enriching the civilization of this world untrammelled by fears of hunger, malnutrition and shortages. As far as the document is concerned, I find it interesting for the substantive matter that it embodies and more for the reflection of the serious desire on the part of FAO to play a central role in the alleviation of the African problem. There is much to commend in this document and less to criticize. However, I find the title of the document, namely Follow-up on the General Assembly Session, is a misnomer because two-thirds of the document is devoted to FAO's contribution prior to the General Assembly Session rather as a follow-up to it. The essential questions bearing upon the follow-up are, what has been achieved by way of resource mobilization for the secondly the steps taken towards actual implementation. The document is silent on these matters, leading us to conclude that progress has been slow in these respects. The first question relates to firm fi nancial th foreign exchange component of the African programme over 1986 to 1990. Undoubtedly this is a considerable amount and it would that they have expressed over the African situation. second question relates to the preparation of plans, the African countries themselves with technical assistance from FAO and other institutions. The Programme has been well underway for a year now and it still is not clear where we stand in these two respects. I would like to point out in this connection that IFAD's African programme has already been under implementation. It became effective only in May of this year. -291- As regards the modalities of implementation, which have been described in paragraph 27 of the document, we find the sentence the paragraph implementation, as the document says. The real implementation will be done by the governments themselves. The Steering Committee's task will views at paragraph a \"policy dialogue\" between the donor and the recipients. In this respect we would like to say that while the donors' participation in a policy be respected. What I that the term \"policy dialogue\" should be used \"policy leverage\" on the recipient countries. As regards the UN Africa Programme and the African situation in general, our comments are that while the UN Programme recognizes agriculture as the main engine for economic development, the fact is that the programme as it stood in May 1986 when it was adopted devoted only 45 percent of the total programme investment to agriculture, the rest going to industry, transportation and communication, trade and finance. I would assume that these areas would be supportive of the agricultural sector. Then again, the deep-rooted, as well as th e multi-faceted, nature of the crisis that we have in Africa points to the need to identify key issues. What is included in the programme seems more of a shopping list for housewives going on an errand in the morning. We are heartened to note that the African governments have declared their resolve, as in the Lagos Plan and OAU etc. , to devote at least 20 to 25 percent of their total national investment to agriculture. With this I would conclude my observations on document CL 90/19. Now I come to document CL 90/21. The relationship between FAO's programme and the UN programme has not been made clear in this document. The timeframe of the United Nations programme is four years, 1986 to 1990. The perspective of FAO's study on which the Programme of Action is based is 25 years. FAO's programme nevertheless is commendable, comprehensive and based on an indepth analysis. It presents its conclusions in stark terms. It paints a frightening Malthusian picture in which unless something is fast some African countries could find relentlessly engaged in a struggle with famines like the one of 1983/84 occurring even in times of normal rainfall. We have noted with satisfaction that the potential for agricultural development does exist through the four i's-inputs, infrastructure, institutions and incentives-as factors are covered under these rubrics. The international framework of aid, trade, protectionism, etc is alluded to as an important factor which in the case of export orientated countries may be a key factor. As regards paragraph 4 of the document, it talks of FAO programmes' complementarity with the UN programme. Similar complementarity of the for Africa is mentioned. by FAO seems to have been underemphasized. Paragraph 6 of the document bears this out. We would like to have an elucidation as to why this important element in the overall strategy has been relegated. Regarding paragraph 12, we are fully supportive of the need to evolve close linkage between Agricultural research, extension and education. As regards the main proposal for a feasibility study on aid-in-kind we feel as many delegates before me have felt that it can serve useful I should like to say that given the dynamism with which the Director-General has been addressing the problems of Africa, it will not be beyond the ability of FAO to implement the Programme of Action that he has formulated. We would request him to see that not much time is lost in putting this Programme of Action into place, so that these programmes become self-executing ones at the earliest opportunity. Ms Anne-Lise PETERSEN (Denmark): We have studied with interest the documentation in front of us and we have listened carefully to the introduction of this important matter. We have also received the executive brief of the in-depth study of the Food and Agricultural problems in Africa, document CL 90/21, however brief, contains the findings of the FAO African study together with a summary of the Programme of Action for African Agriculture. Although we have not received the full study we find that the brief is a well-structured description of all development issues which are well known to the donor countries. We accept that the starting point for making comments on this Agenda item is that the Fourteenth Regional Conference for Africa (as indicated in its Report) has endorsed the main Director-General's four-point strategy of agricultural development. It is in this light that we are making some suggestions and comments. During the last two years have in a number of donor meetings arranged that of stressed the importance of having the long-term development in focus. Now that we are considering the long-term agricultural development of that continent, on this occasion we would have liked to have been confronted with an account of the results of the Rehabilitation Programme and how this is now placed in the long-term plans. Furthermore, it would have been of help to us had we been given the detailed study. One further point which we should like to comment upon is the idea of FAO being given a mandate to carry out a feasibility study of the possibility of stepping up a id-in-kind in the form of agricultural inputs. In this connection, I feel it necessary to make some general comments. Each year Denmark has pledged a steady increase in the financial volume of their development assistance. We have also, as accepted policy, been giving high priority to the development of agricultural production and stab ilization of food supplies in the developing countries. Therefore, the total framework is set and every new programme can only be implemented at the cost of other activities being given a lower priority. In other words, no principle of additionality can be applied just because a new programme is adopted. This certainly applies to the proposal for an aid-in-kind programme. It is stated that the proposal for stepping up aid-in-kind is a means of balancing aid to produce food in comparison to the increasing food aid. Whilst we acknowledge permanent monitoring, not agree that at present an in-balance exists between aid to produce food and food aid. I feel it important to emphasize that aid-in-kind is being utilized in a big way to generate bilateral aid from donor countries to recipient countries. of \"tied aid\". A multilateral organization such opinion, consider very or would an activity which is predominantly being handled bilaterally. From the document in front of us, we note that the Di rector-General is now sugges ting that the feasibility study should be a global study. In this connection we should have to express a serious word of warning. In this context we would also warn FAO against any re-establishment of a link so-called surplus capacity of industries in the developed countries and nid for development. Eventually that could turn history back to the situation we had some twenty years ago. In food aid, for instance, we have almost succeeded in cu tting such links. development assistance and specifically agencies such as FAO should not change the balance too much from software to hardware. -1393- Concerning the proposed feasibility study, we are now faced with having to make a decision in the Council. However, we find it might be premature to start such global feasibility study at this stage. However, a preliminary step could be made to review how agricultural inputs are channelled and used to date by bilateral agencies and international financial institutions in Africa only. Such a review could be made at a much lower cost than that estimated for a full feasibility study. It would give a preliminary indication on the possible need for changing the balance and composition of the different kinds of development assistance to the food and agricultural sector. Only with this information available will we be in a position to decide whether a final feasibility study would be worthwhile. In this connection, perhaps we could ask whether any other international organization has made an account to see whether or not a breakdown focusing on the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sectors, could not be made in a fairly simple way. In confirming Denmark's unconditional support to assist the co untries of Africa in their agricultural development, in making this statement we wish to issue a warning that the FAO, as primus inter pares of the United Nations family in the agricultural sector, should not be diverting from the course laid down in numerous donor meetings and in the special UN sessions on the particular development problems in Africa. In conclusion, I should like to say that in the present critical situation, the whole UN system should try to derive any benefit possible from maximum cooperation and coordination. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n ha tomado debida nota del contenido del documento CL 90/19. Creemos que estuvo plenamente justificada la convocaci\u00f3n del 13 periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de car\u00e1cter extraordinario que examin\u00f3 la cr\u00edtica situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en Africa. Todos conocemos los ant ecedentes econ\u00f3micos y climatol\u00f3gicos que llevaron a esa convocaci\u00f3n y en este sentido reconocemos la plena colaboraci\u00f3n que prest\u00f3 la FAO al octavo preparativo de la Asamblea extraordinaria soble el arroz as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n reconocemos el compromiso pol\u00edtico adoptado por la OUA en julio de 1985, que cons tituye, sin lugar a dudas, la voluntad de los dirigentes africanos de ejecutar el Programa de Acci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas que hace adem\u00e1s hincapi\u00e9 en el sector de la alimentaci\u00f3n y la agricultura. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 convencida de que toda acti\u00f3n para el desarrollo debe partir de las voluntades pol\u00edticas nacionales y que la cooperaci\u00f3n de la comunidad internacional es necesaria para que esa acci\u00f3n para el desarrollo pueda materializarse. La situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de crisis por la que atraviesa el Africa no es cualitativamente distinta de aquella que atraviesan las otras regiones en desarrollo. Las causas son las mismas y las principales causas tienen origen externo, pero es en Africa donde la crisis econ\u00f3mica es m\u00e1s acuciante y, por lo tanto, esa regi\u00f3n amerita une atenci\u00f3n y asistencia prioritaria de los pa\u00edses industrializados y de aquellos pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo, incluyendo pa\u00edses africanos mismos, que est\u00e9n en condiciones de prestar asistencia dentro del marco de la cooperaci\u00f3n Sur-Sur. Otra condici\u00f3n para el desarrollo, para la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y alimentaria es la paz. Condenamos entonces en\u00e9rgicamente toda actividad, militar o no, que realiza el r\u00e9gimen oprobioso de Sud\u00e1frica para desestabilizar a los pa\u00edses vecinos. -1494- Por otro lado, agradecemos al Sr. Walton su presentaci\u00f3n del documento CL 90/21. Este documento contiene informaci\u00f3n \u00fatil sobre el estudio a fondo de los problemas agr\u00edcolas y alimentarios en Africa as\u00ed como las soluciones solicitadas a la FAO por los propios pa\u00edses africanos para que se presentaran en la 14 Conferencia Regional de la FAO para Africa en septiembre pasado. Nadie es mejor que los propios gobiernos africanos para definir y ejecutar su propia estrategia para salir del estancamiento y del decrecimiento actual de la producci\u00f3n de alimentos. Entendemos que esta estrategia incluye un programa de acci\u00f3n para la agricultura africana que es plenamente compatible, es m\u00e1s, complementaria del Programa de Acci\u00f3n de la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas ya que formula sugerencias concretas en cuanto a la forma de poner en pr\u00e1ctica algunos componentes del programa de acci\u00f3n de la Asamblea General. Aqu\u00ed cabe felicitar al Director General de la FAO, Sr. Edouard Saouma, y reconocemos su dinamismo y su dedicaci\u00f3n para tratar de resolver el flagelo del hambre en el mundo y en el Africa particularmente por haber elaborado el programa de acci\u00f3n para la agricultura africana que se compone de dos partes: una estrategia de cuatro puntos para aumentar la producci\u00f3n alimentaria y una iniciativa concreta para incrementar la ayuda en especies como elemento catal\u00edtico para aumentar la producci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan se desprende de los p\u00e1rrafos 15 al 35 del documento CL 90/21, entendiendo que en las propuestas del Director General se subraya que sin la asistencia externa, Africa no puede lograr resultados satisfactorios y que para que Africa obtenga por sus propios medios recursos para su desarrollo es indispensable una transformaci\u00f3n estructural en las relaciones internacionales de intercambio. Esto es extendible a todo el mundo en desarrollo. En base a los p\u00e1rrafos 29 al 31 del documento CL 90/21 sobre el aumento de la ayuda en especies, particularmente basados en los p\u00e1rrafos 35 y 41, apoyamos las conclusiones a que lleg\u00f3 la 14 \u00b0 Conferencia Regional de la FAO para el Africa y apoyamos la propuesta de que la FAO realice un estudio de viabilidad sobre las n ecesidades de ayuda en especies al Africa, seg\u00fan el enfoque establecido en los p\u00e1rrafos 42 al 47 del documento en cuesti\u00f3n y seg\u00fan el enfoque complementario hecho por la delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): Allow us first to say how pleased we are to see you in the chair when we are discussing this particular item of our agenda. Let me also express our congratulations to the Deputy Director-General for his very clear and to-the-point introduction to this item. The United Nations Special Session on Africa was a success. First of all, it constituted a good example of international solidarity at a time when the spirit of multilateralism needs strengthening, and the Programme of Action unanimously adopted in New York is, without doubt, one of the most comprehensive and action-oriented documents ever produced so far by the United Nations on any subject. The first part of the document, that is the Africa Priority Programme for Economic Recovery 1986-1990, adopted by the African Heads of State and Government in July 1985, represents the unpr decided on what to do, and the priorities they set up as well as the action upon which they are embarking are clearly the wisest and soundest ones. However, that the success of African efforts depends on the full s upport or commitme nt of the international community. That brings us to the essential second part of the UN Programme of Action requiring intensified cooperation and substantially increased support at bilateral, regional global level. Increased net flows of financial assistance, especially in the field of agriculture-which has the priority of priorities, as Mr Walton put it, in the Plan of Action-and the alleviation of Africa's debt problems are certainly central to this support. Here we can only review the appeal to especially bigger donors to increase their financial assistance, to improve the quality of their aid, and take measures to cope with Africa's indebtedness. However, aid not being a panacea for development, improvements in the external environment conducive to the expansion of trade opportunities for Africa appear to be a must. A bove all, this the adoption of the historic UN Programme of Action for Africa a new phase has begun in redressing the critical economic situation of this continent and paving the way to its sustained development. It is now no longer necessary to waste previous time in setting forth the objectives. It is n ecessary to act to implement the Programme. A speedy follow-up is the only thing which counts now. As concerns the follow-up at the international level, we believe that the close cooperation and coordination of all related institutions of the United Nations is essential. That is why we welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of a steering committee for the implementation of the Programme of Action. We are certain that FAO should and will play the most prominent role in this helping Africa along the guidelines set forth in the UN Programme of Action. We think that this the Sahel Countries. This programme, which is in line with the UN Programme of Action, deserves to be funded completely to permit its full implementation. Since the UN Programme of Action recognises agricultural development as the main engine for recovery and long- term development in Africa, it is only natural that FAO should play the role of vanguard in its follow-up at the global level. This prominent role is not only justified by the mandate of FAO but it is also deserved by the long-standing record of pursued by this Organization towards the rehabilitation of agriculture in Africa. All the same, the promptness with which our Organization responded to the \"Call active contribution for the preparations for the UN Special Session has been vital to its success. Without such a contribution most certainly the New York paper and the African paper would not have been elaborated or at least would not have achieved the maturity they reflected. As for the follow-up, we note with satisfaction that the FAO Programme of Action based on the findings of its remarkable study \"African Agriculture; The Next 25 Years \" is in full conformity with the UN Programme of Action. In fact, since it contains specific suggestions as to the Programme, Programme by translating this strategy into tactics. We believe that the soundness and timeliness of the FAO Programme of Action is already confirmed by its principal addressees, namely all African States, by its adoption at the Fourteenth FAO Regional Conference for Africa held last September. The reconfirmation by OAU of Programme. After such Programme have been almost redundant for my delegation to comment on its first part relating to the four point strategy to raise food production. We can only hail the soundness of the first three points. As to the fourth point concerning the improvement of the international economic environment, we have already expressed at the beginning of our intervention the importance we attach to increased trade opportunities and technical assistance for African countries, as well as to the alleviation of the burden of debt of the continent. Now 1 come to the second part of the Director-General's programme, namely stopping assistance to Africa and to developing countries in general. We have studied carefully the proposal put forward in document CL 90/21. Since the Council is called upon to take a decision or give a reaction concerning the feasibility study which forms the first step of this proposal, we thought we also on our part should express our views on the subject. First of all, we entirely agree with the Director-General that the essential for initiating such a study, and we hope that as clear a consensus as possible will emerge from our meeting. In this present case-and it is a rare occasion for my delegation-we are speaking from the position of a donor. Although Turkey's experience as a donor country is quite recent and her programme of aid is relatively modest, still -1696- the disbursement of our assistance of $10 million to Sahel countries is well under way and, more importantly, the is of aid-in-kind involving the supply of agricultural inputs. Not only for this reason but also because we believe in its usefulness we find that the Director-General's proposal is fully acceptable to us. We think that this is a path well worth being explored. Also, given the complexity of we think that a feasibility study is required to determine the additional possibilities existing in this field, that is in addition to the actual aid-in-kind practices. We think that such a study may even give an impetus to the already on-going aid-in-kind actions by focusing the the administrators of donor, as as recipient even if it does not lead to more detailed action programmes. We also believe, for reasons of emphasis as well as of economy, that this the surplus capacity be African recipients only. Its extent can be enlarged to cover all developing countries if and as appropriate a later stage. A. K. M. Kamaluddin CHOUDHURY (Bangladesh): It was our special privilege to participate in and contribute to the UN Special Session on Africa in May 1986 in New York. We express our appreciation to the Director-General of FAO and the Secretariat for the constructive efforts they have made towards the success of the Special Session in New York. The Fourteenth Meeting of the Regional Conference of FAO in Africa held in September 1986 made a significant contribution to implementing the first phase of the recommendations of the Special Session. As regards document CL 90/21, my delegation has always been appreciative of studies of this nature which help to crystallize problems and help us focus attention on issues of such critical nature as that of African agriculture. In the light of the very clear introduction of the Deputy Director-General, my delegation has no doubt about the feasibility study of this kind to find out the practicability of aid in kind directed towards enhancing the agricultural production as a sound proposition. My delegation would extend its support to this undertaking. In this connection my delegation attaches particular importance to the proposal of the Director-General which he has subsumed under the four \"Is\". We are particularly happy to note that the FAO would coordinate its efforts with the UNDP Round VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): I would like to commend the Secretariat of FAO, and particularly the Deputy Director-General, Mr. Walton, for his introduction to the subject and for presenting a very useful analysed report on all African food crises, and the national and international action to overcome the acute food crisis and for laying the foundation for a long-term solution. 1 would like to underline and praise the initiatives and the role and contribution of FAO in fighting the acute crisis and in the preparation of the UN special session which approved the global UN programme of action for economic recovery and development of Africa by 1990, in which food agriculture has a central role to play. For this reason it is logical to expect that the international organizations in the field of food and agriculture, particularly FAO, have to play a central role in the follow-up activities as well. The UN Programme of Action, and the conclusions and recommendations of the African Regional Conference held in Yamoussoukro should represent the backbone of the future follow-up action by the national governments of Africa and international community including the governments of countries and the necessity of a -1797- coherent and coordinated action by the FAO and other inter-national organizations in this field. Here I also have in mind IFAD which has launched and approved, by the governing council, a new additional financial facility of 300 million dollars for Sub-Sahelian African countries affected drought. we welcome continuation and strengthening of cooperation between IFAD and the FAO, giving always priority to needs and the requirements of developing countries concerned. context of the implementation of the programmes approved by the UN General Assembly, as well as African Regional Conference, my delegation appreciates and supports the proposal contained in document CL 90/21 including the action orientated towards development of food and agriculture in Africa through the increased assistance-in-kind. This approach has proved its mind the positive results of the so-called green revolution in Asia, as well as experiences of many other developing countries. In the framework of the approach and implementation of the programmes approved, we also support the African countries' request to the Director-General of FAO and the proposal of the Director-General, to work out a feasibility study on stepping up aid-in-kind in the agricultural development of Africa. In executing this task the Director-General should have the full support and assistance of all countries, in the preparation of the study and later in the implementation of the programme to follow. Here, I would like to stress, that my delegation does not go along with, and could not understand those delegates, who have been expressing themselves against the idea of the necessity for additional resources for these purposes, for the development of agriculture in Africa, in this manner. As a number of other delegates before me, I would like to stress that the study should focus at this stage on Africa. However it may, as appropriate, take the regions and recommend elements for a more global action in this respect in future. The study should be prepared in time for the next FAO Conference to enable it to consider it properly, make suggestions and take decisions on further action. The study should take into account the suggestions made during this session by all delegates, but particularly those from Africa who have dealt very comprehensively with this. Particularly, I have in mind the very contentful statement of His Excellency, the Minister for Agriculture of Tanzania. As the representative of Indonesia and some others this afternoon, I would like to stress the need, and to request the Director-General to take into account in the study, the possible of economic of the increased aid-in-kind in the agricultural development of Africa. The experiences and capacities of inputs, production and supply by developing countries, both in Africa and in other regions, should be integrated into a cooperative action by all countries, African, other developing and developed as the international organizations concerned, particularly FAO. -1898- Antonio Albertino AFONSO FAO pour l'Afrique de Yamoussoukro, en Cete d'Ivoire, et de remercier \u00e9galement M. Walton pour son excellente pr\u00e9sentation des documents. Cela dit, nous nous d\u00e9clarons en faveur de la r\u00e9alisation du programme d'action et, pour ne pas r\u00e9p\u00e9ter dit, la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation taking up a feasibility study, as contained in the document CL 90/21, deserves to be supported by this Council. The critical economic situation of Africa was considered by the UN General Assembly in May and June last. The problems of Africa, in the field of food and agriculture, were gone into twice in the last two regional conferences for Africa of the FAO. On the basis of the request made in the 13th FAO Regional Conference for Africa in July 1984, the Director-General has got a study carried out of the agricultural and food problems in Africa. What does this study, based on country level and sub-regional analysis reveal? It shows that the present food s upply position, not as liquid as it is in some instances, is unsustainable. It also shows that if no Africa's food situation will deteriorate further during the next 25 years. Famines of the magnitude experienced during the 1983/84 drought could become a regular feature, even periods of more normal rainfall. Highlighting the drain on the foreign exchange of these countries, if they were to meet the shortfalls through imports, the report indicates the scenario of survival with incalculable consequences not only for Africa, but for the world at large. These portents have serious implications and significance for the world as a whole and have a special relevance for the FAO in view of its charter and objectives. In this context the Director-General has proposed a programme of action in parts. They underline the fact that Africa cannot succeed without from outside. Another significant point, emphasized by the Director-General, was that there is need for a balance between food aid and aid to produce food. In this context the role of aid-in-kind, which is not really new as a concept, and which we know had played a significant role in the launching of the Asia's green revolution, has been highlighted in the Director-General's report. Whilst I would thank the delegate from Canada for the references he has made to the achievements in the field of agriculture in India, I would, with due respect, submit that the situation in India today, and in many of the Asian countries, is radically different from the problems that are facing the countries of Africa in 1986/87. Possibly, the situation now in Africa is comparable to the situation existing in the early sixties in India when there were looming shortages in food production. The Canadian delegate has also referred to the concept that for achieving self-sufficiency it is the national will that counts and not so much the aid from abroad. Whilst I would submit that nothing on earth can substitute for the will of the nation to pull itself up by the boot strings, the aid from abroad, in terms of commod ities, also could be significance, provided it is matched with the requirements of the country and the efforts made by that country to improve its own agriculture, as the Indian experience has amply shown. This report of the Director-General containing his recommendations was accepted by the Fourteenth FAO Regional Conference on Africa in September 1986. The Conference has a ccepted the three-point programme of the Director- General covering expansions of aid-in-kind, enhancement of local production of inputs and promotion of inter- regional trade in inputs. The Conference accepted the view that a feasib ility study was required to explore the practicability of aid-in-kind and that is the background for the proposal we are now considering today. In relation to this proposal, as we see it, the questions we have to answer are four. Firstly, should there be such a feasibility study at all? I would submit that against the background of what has been mentioned and considering that the financial profit involved would not be very high we would strongly support the proposal that the feasibility study be undertaken. -1999- The second question that arises is what should be the time frame for the study and when should the report become available? Considering the problems that the African countries have been facing and recognizing that time is of the essence in the operation, we would suggest that the study be carried out as early as possible so that the report becomes available to the Council in 1987 and thereafter to the 1987 Conference. By the time the Conference meets, the report would have been analysed and would possibly have resulted in a specific plan and a programme of action which could be carefully studied by the Conference, resulting in concrete delegate Canada s uggested a widening of the terms of reference of the document suggested in paragraph 46 of the document and has suggested that the national strategies for obtaining agricultural development should be analysed and they should be studied in the context of efforts being made by the member countries as whether those strategies expensive in terms of money, also in terms of time. We would also therefore support the proposal that the terms of reference, as envisaged in paragraph 46 of the document, be agreed to without any further broadening. The last question which we have to face is whether this feasibility study should cover only Africa or should it cover other developing countries all over the world? Considering that the proposal emanated from the background of two Regional FAO Conferences on Africa, it would be appropriate that Africa remains as the main focus for this proposed feasibility study. However, without any severe stretching of the timeframe envisaged, if it becomes feasible to cover, say, a few developing countries outside Africa, possibly they could be considered, subject the conditions that no further time would needed for study. Subject to these observations, we would submit that the proposal for the feasibility study be endorsed by the Council. Amadou Moustapha KAMARA Ma delegation vous adresse Walton la pr\u00e9sentation claire qu'il nous a faite g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur la situation collaborateurs pour la contribution d\u00e9cisive de notre Organisation faisabilit\u00e9 pour un accroissement en \u00e0 esquiss\u00e9s \u00e0 la page 11 du document CL 90/21 l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel des termes de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de l'\u00e9tude envisag\u00e9e, ils le puisqu'ils prennent Organisation, et de son Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, M. Edouard Saouma, un grain a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 germer \u00e0 New York, en mai et juin 1986, il a entam\u00e9 \u00e0 Yamoussoukro Rome, il est n\u00e9cessaire que notre Conseil lui en donne la possibilit\u00e9. Ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation souhaite que of a programme on possible aid-in-kind. FAO met its obligation to the call made in the Harare Declaration and now has developed a proposal that aims to come up with practical proposals. We hope that the study shall have a practical approach. We believe that many people are now aware of the food plight of most developing countries. It is the practical use of available knowledge and resources to remedy the situation that needs to be focused on. There is need to examine also and come up with measures to protect the environment. Land protection, nutrition and measures its and management and also resource conservation are facets that made mention of the estimated costs of the order of about 400, 000 dollars which could be reduced to about 200, 000 dollars by inclusion or exclusion of case studies. We strongly believe that on a subject as important as this, penny-pinching will not be a wise move. We are conscious of the financial problems the Organization faces, but this type of study can only have its true worth and value when clearly substantiated with practical case studies. of regional institutional organizations, such as SADCC in the Southern African region, should be included in such case studies. So much is happening in developing countries which have a general shortage of training manpower. be made to the man or woman-hours are becoming very stretched. We fully agree and thank you for the eloquent comments which you made, Mr Chairman, when you were talking on behalf of your country and we believe those comments also represented those of the SADCC countries and members, of which you are a valuable member yourself. We can assure FAO of all necessary support needed from our region in carrying out this study. We give this assurance in our capacity as the coordinator of food security and agriculture in the SADCC countries. Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo) Je voudrais, nous r\u00e9sultats de nos montrent une fois plus combien la situation critique de l'Afrique est partag\u00e9e par la communaut\u00e9 internationale, sans exclure qui que ce soit dans ce dialogue. Nous voudrions lancer un l'\u00e9tude concernera que l'Afrique, dans un premier temps, ne doit pas frustrer nos amis et fr\u00e8res du Groupe des 77. Nous voudrions les remercier pour leur sens la caract\u00e8re de interventions. Une a ici, est une aide additionnelle que les pays d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s promis de Millicent M. States of America): The States has already spoken but I cannot resist saying something that 1 am so longing to say to you and to my fellow colleagues. I do not represent any tremendous organization like the OAU whose representative has just spoken; so I just have to ask your indulgence more personally. I was struck by what the delegate from Zimbabwe had to say. I was there and 1 saw the master farmer scheme. More than 50 percent of the people enrolled in the particular village 1 visited were women. This is a nation-wide system and we have a wonderful training and visiting system in India which has been used in 40 countries as developed in India, the training and visiting system. So when the delegate of Zimbabwe said \"let us not have duplication\", I was struck, remembering that visit to Zimbabwe and what we have heard about the training and visiting. But I would like to say something to the Secretariat and to any experts in this scheme for the feasibility study. 1 would urge that one goes down into the village and listen. Maybe there is a group of farmers who have formed an independent cooperative, their farms are near together, and maybe they could well use a tractor because they would have the dues from their cooperative to pay for the fuel and the spare parts. But not every farmer will want a tractor. Some will want a donkey or a pair of oxen or a horse or something to pull the plough, to take the cart so that they can get their produce to town. So sit down and listen and see what is wanted. It is not enough to say it will vary country by country. I have been in so many African countries and one area varies from another. You cannot say this will be all right in Tanzania. Look at the Chaga district which the delegate has spoken about. So sit down and listen. That to me is where the beginning of all the improvement is going to take place. If it does not start there, none of it will be any good. Big ideas in air-cooled offices will not do it. -302- CHAIRMAN: I thank the representative of the United States for her timely warning and for her experience in the field. I think we all share the feeling that the grassroots participation approach is the best. Mrs. Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): Mr Chairman, the oxen would (Ph ilippines): At this stage of the debate I can afford to be very brief, just to say that the Philippines believe that the feasibility study on aid-in-kind for Africa deserves to be supported. We hope there can be a consensus on the desirability of undertaking the feasibility study so that there can be justification to allocate the necessary resources for this purpose. We believe that this study should initially be limited to Africa, and if resources and time allow, it could be extended to the other regions. The reasons for this are spelled out very clearly in document CL 90/21. First we say that food production can be increased by greater inputs. The amount of output can only depend on the amount of input. Land gives out according to the measure we put in. The green revolution in Asia has been possible only when rice and wheat grains have been invented that were responsive to fertilizer and when fertilizer was available, together with the appropriate technology. Second, because of the high debt problem of Africa, you need to make this available. The aid-in-kind would probably be a way of circumventing the problem of shortage of resources in inputs, this aid-in-kind of fertilizer and other needed inputs. Finally, the other four l's are required, but without the required inputs this would not produce the necessary effects. These are reasons which have been given over and over again. I just want to say that we agree with this kind of reasoning and we believe and hope that there will be consensus in this hall so that this study can be launched. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sr. Presidente, Sr. Ministrole Tanzania, a los representantes de Colombia nos complace intervenir esta tarde bajo su presidencia despu\u00e9s de haber o\u00eddo esta ma\u00f1ana el llamado elocuente y sentido que Ud. hizo en favor del Africa. Ten\u00edamos unas notas, pens\u00e1bamos intervenir, pero, desp\u00faes de la declaraci\u00f3n alegre y optimista de nuestra querida amiga Millicent Fenwick, Embajadora de los Estados Unidos, preferimos reducir nuestra intervenci\u00f3n para facilitar el curso de nuestros trabajos a apoyar el llamado que ha hecho nuestro vecino de la derecha, el Embajador Tchicaya del Congo. S\u00f3lo queremos expresar nuestra opini\u00f3n en relaci\u00f3n con el alcance de este Estudio. Representamos a Colombia, pa\u00eds de una regi\u00f3n como Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, cuyas condiciones econ\u00f3micas y sociales se vienen deteriorando progresivamente. En su declaraci\u00f3n inaugural el Director General dijo que ser\u00eda posible extender ese Estudio a los otros pa\u00edses en desarrollo. El Embajador Tchicaya del Congo y otros colegas africanos se refirieron en t\u00e9rminos amplios y generosos a cualquier posibilidad, pero fueron realistas como los dem\u00e1s miembros del Consejo. Por eso, la delegaci\u00f3n do Colombia se suma a lo que han dicho M\u00e9xico, Venezuela y Brasil, particularmente, en el sentido de que el Director General podr\u00eda considerar la posibilidad de que en el Estudio a largo plazo sobre la situaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y alimentaria de Am\u00e9rica Latina, si fuere oportuno y conveniente, se incluya un cap\u00edtulo relacionado con esta ayuda en especies, que tambl\u00e9n necesitan algunos pa\u00edses de nuestra regi\u00f3n. Ese Estudio para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe fue solicitado por la Conferencia Regional de Barbados, agosto de 1986, y s\u00f3lo ser\u00e1 sometido a la pr\u00f3xima Conferencia Regional, segundo semestre de 1988, de manera que el Director General dispondr\u00e1 de un amplio marco de tiempo dentro del cual podr\u00e1 tomar la decisi\u00f3n m\u00e1s conveniente. -303- S. Gblorzuo TOWEH (Liberia): Mr Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to see you chair this 90th Session of our Council, especially at this moment when we again began our other round of discussion on agricultural and food problems in Africa. My delegation therefore warmly commends introduction to documents CL 90/21 and CL 90/19. Again we are assembled here to re-examine the findings of the FAO Africa study, as we did a few weeks ago in the city of Yamoussoukro. My delegation will not prolong the deba te on this issue but rather re-echo our support for the FAO feasibility study on aid in Africa and our hope that this study in the future be concluded for other developing regions. My delegation still believes that the four i's-incentives, inputs, institutions and infrastructure-are basic to agricultural development. Attainment of food self-sufficiency in line with the four i's, as proposed in the feasibility study on aid-in-kind, will undoubtedly serve as a catalyst for increased food production in Africa. We believe aid-in-kind will provide us with an opportunity to use production inputs and in the future, to reduce our debt burden by increasing our foreign exchange earnings. Nations Development Programme): I am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to comment briefly on behalf of my Organization on this very important issue-the follow-up on the UN General Assembly Special Session on the Critical Situation in Africa. I read with interest the documents presented and listened Deputy Mr Walton. The enriching intervention by the distinguished members of the Council, as well as the inspiring message of the President of the Republic of Senegal, and the Chairman of CILSS delivered by the coordinating minister of the latter last represent another contribution the deliberation of important Agenda The and the importance UNDP and its Governing Council attach to the destiny of this continent most in need is clearly demonstrated by the allocation of over 40 percent of the total UNDP resources for the next cycle 1986/1991 to this continent. Participants in this forum are well aware that the Governing Council of UNDP at its last June Session discussed very intensively and extensively the UN Programme for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted by the Special Session of the UN General Assembly earlier this year, as the latter assigned major follow-up responsibilities to UNDP and the the table and consultative group meetings for monitoring the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action. As reflected in document CL 90/19, UNDP is a member of the Steering Committee for the implementation of the Programme of Action. The Administrator is determined to play his full part in this regard. UNDP will play an important monitoring role at the national level in the follow-up to the new action programme. One of our first tasks will be to ensure IPF programmes reflect the in this line have already after the Governing Council the Administrator visited some of the African countries and consulted with their governments. He met with Resident Representatives from the region where he visited projects on the ground, and gave specific instructions for the preparation of the Country Programmes in the African Continent. He pointed out that a coherent and concerted required donor and the recipient governments, if we were to fulfill the expectations of the international community. -304- Senior which was attended by the Director-General for Development and International Economic Cooperation, the Executive Secretary of OAU, the Executive Secretary of ECA, the Associated Administrator of UNDP and other senior officials. This meeting provided an excellent opportunity for better coherent action at this important stage in initiating the new action programme. One of our key preoccupations in the upcoming Cycle is how best we can support governments in implementing the new Programme of Action for Africa. Through the close and continued dialogue we conduct with them, we are working to ensure that UNDP's assistance will go primarily to agriculture, human resources and institution-building. Through our associated funds, we are focussing on its other major priorities: programmes of volunteer assistance. For your information, the Regional Bureau for Africa of UNDP has recently completed the review of the FAO proposals for inclusion in the Fourth Cycle Regional Programme 1987-1991. into consideration, however, some important relevant events which took late year and their outcome such as: the issues related to agricultural development oulined in the UN Programme of Action for 1986-1990, the Second Extraordinary Session of Ministers held in Addis Ababa, 13-16 October 1986, and its recommendations, the Programme of Action endorsed at the Fourteenth FAO Regional Ministerial Conference held in Yamoussoukro, 2-12 UNDP decided an entire examination of its regional approach to agriculture in Africa in order to ensure that the Fourth Regional Programme for Africa be more in tune with the priorities defined by the above mentioned To Panel of Consultants to identify projects which clearly put in action those recommendations and priorities. This proposal has r ecently been communicated to FAO and we hope that FAO will agree with this very constructive and action-oriented approach. However, while helping Africa work out alert the region's immediate trials, inlcuding the latest paradox of return of hoards of locusts, which the Director-General of FAO, Dr Saouma, stressed in his excellent introductory statement on the first day. We have recently channelled over 1. 6 million dollars from out to Combat Famine and Developing Countries\" into new locust control and aerial spray operations in the six most affected countries, in addition to the UNDP authorities working closely with FAO and UNDP offices in the field. In I that UNDP looks and organizations, each within its competence, as well as donors in assisting the African countries in the implementation of their Programme of Action. Raphael (Observateur de point important de l'ordre du Elle voudrait f\u00e9liciter M. intervention sera sur la participation active et intensive de la rappeler que, de interventions la FAO nom du Pr\u00e9sident que examin\u00e9es de La d\u00e9claration de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de la Belgique, au nom des pays de la CEE, et autres malgache voudrait en tout cas assurer le noble t\u00e2che. Assefa YILALA (Observer for Ethiopia): Like all those who have spoken before us we should also like to indicate our at seeing chair deliberation this important Agenda item. The contribution of food accessibility by all to the well-being of mankind has been dealt with adequately and therefore our delegation sees no need to repeat it here, except to mention that the African situation is no exception in this regard, as has been expressed by all those who intervened on this item. The concerted effort and the pace with which long-term solutions are sought to the economic crisis facing Africa today, which is appropriately referred to, is a concern of mankind as a whole rather than an exclusive African problem which will very much determine the future a ccessibility to food because the economic crisis has a high and direct bearing on food production capabilities. In the framework of the prevailing economic crisis and the present trend of global economic development, securing food from the international trade is a very remote probability, and therefore the likelihood of improving a ccess to food through this alternative is also unlikely within the foreseeable future. -306- A greater understanding of the magnitude and the critical nature of the economic situation in Africa is to be realized in the response of the international community in terms both the short-term emergency operations and Africa's priority programme for economic recovery. The 13th Special Session of the UN General Assembly which was preceded by the 1984 Session of ECOSOC, the Addis Ababa OAU Su mmit Meeting of the Whole and FAO's unreserved involvement in the study, are all manifestations of the attention that needs to be considered as a background of the problem being faced. The fact that global distribution of food production is being reported as favourable, even though the forecast for cereal production is slightly below that of the previous year tends to shadow the critical economic situation in Africa. Even though food production patterns have been different from previous years, the fact that, this is a short-term outlook due to the season's favourable rainfall situation does not guarantee sustained food the future. Over and above the cumulative effect of the historic drought in over 20 African countries, food production has been faced with further calamities of drought in seven African countries. like to mention the Ethiopian food shortage situation as one example, not as an isolated case. In Ethiopia, where the historic continental drought had its maximum strength, the rainfall in 1986 was favourable in most parts of the country with the exception of the south-east, south-west and the northern parts of the country, either because of late or erratic rainfall in the middle of the growing season. The persistency of the repeated drought has become a cause for shortage of food again in those affected areas. Because of the cumulative effect of the drought in the past and the present drought in some parts of the country, the food shortage situation will continue to prevail even though the magnitude of the shortfall is below that of the previous years. Further to the drought, in some parts of the country crop losses due to locusts and grasshoppers in the north-western part of the country have become an additional cause of shortfalls. Although the rainfall situation in the growing season of 1986 was favourable and created a better growing environment for production the situation was not fully utilized because most of the continuous effort in maintaining a satisfactory level of food production. This is one example where the food shortage situation is still prevailing and yet it is being overshadowed by the overall favourability of the rain in 1986. I am sure that the same holds true in most of the drought-affected African countries. The present food situation in Africa is just of a temporary nature when one looks at it from a generalized point of view. Even worse is the fact that this generalized view tends to shadow the existence of shortage of food and millions becoming victims in the situation. The critical economic situation in Africa will require longer and closer attention for it to recover. The area of food production to which the agenda item under discussion is related will also require as much attention. In the study of African agriculture during the next 25 years it is indicated that Africa can feed itself provided that the out that Africa has potential for sustained food production and yet in limited by capital and other investment resources to exploit it so as to mobilise the resource available. The flow of capital from developed to African countries over and above the co mmitments of African countries to devote more resources to agriculture comes into the scene as an important factor to be considered. Aid-in-kind as one way for flow of capital was supported by the African Ministers of Agriculture during the Fourteenth Session of the African Regional Conference as it was presented in the document. The aid-in-kind which is presented for consideration is therefore accepted as a major means of enhancing food production and agricultural development. Hence, the present request is to allow FAO to do the detailed study in this regard. My delegation would like to indicate its support for the proposed detailed study. -307- As it stands now, the critical economic situation of Africa has become a focal area of attention for the international community, and therefore tackling the economic problem of the African continent as priority area for consideration will face difficulty, and need clarification n ecessary, in contribution of demonstrating the value of such a scheme. It is therefore the view of the Ethiopian delegation that priority should be given to to the least developed delegation fully that the globe are faced with input supply problems, and that the need to look at it as a global perspective is equally important. However, as further groundwork will have to be done in order to launch a study at the international level, any delay in launching will only lead to a worsening economic situation in Africa. Therefore, we would like to indicate that the study should go ahead as far as the African continent is concerned, and meanwhile preparatory work countries as to cover developing countries ultimately in the final analysis. In listening to the interventions made on this most of the discussions. Therefore, we would like to make the small reminder that reference be made to \"stepped up aid-in-kind\". Finally, my delegation would like to thank the Director-General for the follow-up action taken after the African Regional Conference, for bringing this important item of discussion to the attention of the Council, and we thank the Deputy Director-General for summarizing the agenda item c'est grand moi pr\u00e9sider le de l'agriculture d'un nous examinons un point de l'ordre du jour crucial pour notre continent. Tenant compte des orateurs qui l'ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, notamment du Congo, de Madagascar, de l'Inde, du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, pour ne pas par certes, la pierre angulaire indispensable pour l'augmentation de la production vivri\u00e8re et africains ont besoin pour leur production vivri\u00e8re. C'est pour cela que mon demande nu Conseil de donner mandnt nu Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la FAO d'acc\u00e9der \u00e0 terminer, deux tenu r\u00e9pondu sont les chefs de file, (Observer for Kenya): First of all, let me say how happy we are to see you on the Chair, especially representing our side of the region, East Africa. My delegation would like to thank the Deputy Director-General, Mr Walton, for the introduction of the very clear Secretariat documents CL 90/19 and CL 90/21. My delegation welcomes the report on the United Nations Plan of Action for Africa and the proposals of the Director-General for the follow-up. The FAO has continued to show great concern for the problems of Africa and was closely involved in the preparation of the African document and the proposals to the special session of the General Assembly. The study \"African agriculture: the next 25 years\" is a valuable document which will remain a major reference in agricultural strategic developments in Africa, thanks to the FAO. During the 14th FAO Regional Conference in Yamoussoukro, my country participated fully and made our views and support quite clear. We believe, and in this view support the delegate and Minister for Agriculture from Tanzania, yourself, Mr Chairman, that the African leaders have put their views and strategies together, and what they require most is cooperation and support from the international community. In the same vein, we believe that regional cooperation will play a crucial role in the development efforts in Africa. In this regard we endorse the statement by the delegate of Uganda on Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Desertification (IGADD), and 1 agree with the delegates who have spoken on the role and need for coordination with other UN organizations for maintaining FAO in the forefront. The Special Programme for sub-Saharan Africa under IFAD is a step towards translating and supplementing the UN Action Plan for Africa. My country is amongst the initial 20 proposed beneficiaries. My delegation takes this opportunity to convey our gratitude. Coming back to the proposals of the Director-General on aid-in-kind, we would like to add that it will have a major role to play in the African agriculture if directed to increasing the productive elements on a per-unit basis. We feel this initiative by FAO for a study merits our support and hope that such an initiative will continue to be manifested by Africans themselves and the international community to accelerate economic recovery in Africa. Sra. Yolanda GAGO DE SINIGAGLIA (Observador de la Costa Rica): La delegaci\u00f3n de Costa Rica interviene brevemente para referirse a las declaractiones de Venezuela y Colombia sobre el estudio para Am\u00e9rica Latina, en el cual el Gobierno de Costa Rica desea que se prosigan los estudios sobre el tabaco iniciados en 1982/83 abarcando cifras de empleo y rentas fiscales generadas por los sectored y la importancia de ese producto en la econom\u00eda de los po\u00edses subdcsarrollados, incluyendo adem\u00e1s el tema del tabaco dentro de la actualizaci\u00f3n peri\u00f3dica del cuadro, estudio global y proyecciones de insumo. -309- Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Nos complacen los avances de Africa y desde luego el estudio que ha suscitado la interrogante sobre la posibilidad de una ayuda adicional en especie. Por cierto, una coordinada ayuda en especie deber\u00eda ser alentada y nos sumamos a las delegaciones que han apoyado tal idea puesto que permite conocer con certeza los beneficios efectivos. Nos atrevemos a insinuar que se estudie la posibilidad de introducir alg\u00fan componente de monetizaci\u00f3n por cuanto las donaciones puras y simples tienen conotaciones paternalistas que pudieran hacer m\u00e1s mal que el bien que procuran remediar. Han llamado la atenci\u00f3n de mi delegaci\u00f3n, sin embargo, las reticencias que algunos han manifestado respecto del segundo aspecto consultado por la Secretar\u00eda; esto es, respecto de la conveniencia de limitar o no la acci\u00f3n a los pa\u00edses africanos, p\u00e1rrafo 48 del documento CL 90/21. Al respecto, mi delegaci\u00f3n debe recordar que ya el se\u00f1or Director General expres\u00f3 en la sesi\u00f3n inaugural de este Consejo su esperanza en una respuesta favorable a la petici\u00f3n que sobre la materia an\u00e1loga efectu\u00f3 la Conferencia Regional de la FAO para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe recientemente celebrada en Barbados. Mi delegaci\u00f3n insta a todas sus similares a considerar de la mayor importancia la suficiente universalidad en la acci\u00f3n de la FAO. Asimismo, estimamos que el problema b\u00e1sico no es el de restringir los planos de acci\u00f3n de la FAO en favor de determinados sectores, sino en proseguir una labor mancomunada para que los esfuerzos y recursos lleguen simult\u00e1neamente a todos quienes lo necesitan, de acuerdo con una debida consideraci\u00f3n a todas las \u00e1reas que requieren esta ayuda. Si Am\u00e9rica Latina tiene un mayor grado de desarrollo relativo, su situaci\u00f3n no puede ser penalizada recibiendo menos atenci\u00f3n que otras zonas. La credibilidad de las organizaciones de vocaci\u00f3n universal est\u00e1 vinculada a pr\u00e1cticas que guardan relaci\u00f3n con su propia naturaleza y, por lo tanto, con una asignaci\u00f3n amplia de los esfuerzos. Mi pa\u00eds ha manifestado en la reciente Conferencia Regional de la FAO para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe que el estudio sobre la situaci\u00f3n actual y perspectivas del sector alimentario y agr\u00edcola en la regi\u00f3n es n ecesario para lograr un crecimiento acelerado y un mayor bienestar de la poblaci\u00f3n. En esa oportunidad Chile hizo presente los requerimientos en los campos de investigaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola, transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda, sanidad agropecuaria y protecci\u00f3n de los recursos naturales, sin descuidar en el desarrollo agr\u00edcola el gasto social en el sector, incluyendo la educaci\u00f3n, salud, pol\u00edtica administrativa y sus relaciones con la infraestructura y servicios b\u00e1sicos del citado sector agropecuario. Mi delegaci\u00f3n debe concordar en que este aspecto tiene vinculaciones con los aspectos financieros y por ello cree del caso se\u00f1alar que la cuesti\u00f3n de la asignaci\u00f3n de recursos impl\u00edcita en estas cuestiones no consiste, ni podr\u00eda consistir, en entregar un pastel a uno mientras los dem\u00e1s ven comer. El caso consistir\u00eda m\u00e1s bien en tratar de obtener m\u00e1s pasteles para que todos coman. La asignaci\u00f3n de recursos en forma restringida podr\u00eda estar conduciendo a las fracasadas pr\u00e1cticas de nivelar hacia abajo en vez de buscar que todos crezcan participando de un pastel mayor. Propicia mi delegaci\u00f3n la opci\u00f3n amplia y universal para la alternativa del p\u00e1rrafo 48 del documento CL 90/21. En la misma forma en que mi delegaci\u00f3n puso de relieve la indiscutible ilegalidad del no pago oportuno de la contribuci\u00f3n, igualmente debe se\u00f1alar que consideramos fuera del esp\u00edritu de nuestra normativa constitucional la tendencia de propiciar exclusivimos en las corrientes de cooperaci\u00f3 n multilateral, a\u00f1adiendo que ambos fen\u00f3me nos pudieran generar iguales consecuencias desestabilizadoras, comprobadas en otros foros. Perm\u00edtame se\u00f1alar que la posici\u00f3n de Chile, por lo dem\u00e1s compartida con muchos pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina, no puede considerarse un amago para los intereses de los pa\u00edses hermanos de Africa; no puede mi delegaci\u00f3n creer que los intereses de una regi\u00f3n en desarrollo pasen por el camino de la posposici\u00f3n y del olvido de otra, por que la altura de miras y nuestra fe en esa regi\u00f3n hermana de Africa nos impiden creer que esa clase de pensamiento prevalece entre los pa\u00edses aqu\u00ed representados. -310- M\u00e1s que nunca mi delegaci\u00f3n piensa que en todos los pa\u00edses en desarrollo existe la tarca de mancomunar voluntades y estrechar filas para que nadie se sienta al margen o sobrepasado; en conjunto podemos aspirar a lo mejor, separados seremos lo que otros quieran que seamos. A determinados pa\u00edses desarrollados que se han pronunciado sobre aspectos de principio y han apoyado unas s\u00f3lidas tendencias restrictivas, no podemos menos que expresar nuestro asombro. La lectura y aplicaci\u00f3n del pre\u00e1mbulo de la Constituci\u00f3n de la FAO deber\u00eda guiar los pasos de este Consejo si realmente creemos en esta Organizaci\u00f3n, en su gran futuro y en el marco general de normas que regulan la acci\u00f3n de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Perm\u00edtame finalizar expresando admiraci\u00f3n por la tesonera labor de Africa que est\u00e1 dando significativa y cabal prioridad al sector silviagropecuario, asignando un papel trascendente a la autoayuda en su reciente Conferencia Regional en Costa de Marfil. C\u00e9lestin KAREKEZI (Observateur repris dans le document Ousman N. R. OTHMAN (Gambia): At the end of a very long debate I would like, very briefly, to say how very pleased the Gambian delegation is to see you chair the discussion on an item on Africa. I also wish to thank the Director-General for his efforts to promote agricultural development in Africa and Mr Walton for his excellent presentation of the working document under discussion. As for the proposals contained in delegation would wish to indicate its total support for the mandate to be given for the feasibility study on aid-in-kind in Africa.

La qualit\u00e9 et le s\u00e9rieux la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e0 qui le l'honneur DIRECTOR-GENERAL: In introduction this morning 1 said that the basic question before the Council is whether there is sufficient support among the donor co justify our launching the feasibility study. response from the Council has clearly been \"yes\". However, there is one item on which a certain ambiguity still remains, and that is the question of whether the study should be limited to Africa or extended globally, and if so at what stage. I think probably the majority of speakers suggest ed that it focus initially on Africa and be extended later to other regions. One specific suggestion has come from the floor, that Latin America be covered separately in the study requested by the last Regional Conference for Latin America and which is destined for the next Regional Conference in Latin America in 1988. That certainly, so far as the Secretariat is concerned, appears a very sensible suggestion. However, there is still some ambiguity regarding coverage of the other regions. There are two possibilities. One is that the non-African regions could be dealt with towards the end of our work on the study for the FAO Conference in 1987 or alternatively that other regions could be covered in the work coming after the FAO Conference. I think it is desirable to have a ruling from the Council on this matter to avoid any ambiguity at a later stage and I commend this for your attention. In supporting the idea of the feasibility Study a number of donor representatives especially expressed a word of caution. These are very much in line with the cautious approach which I adopted in introducing the subject this morning. However, there were two cases in which caution slipped, I think, over the frontier into an area which I will call scepticism. Some specific questions were put to the Secretariat by the two delegates concerned and I would like to comment first on some questions raised by delegate up aid-in-kind, input aid-in-kind is likely to be a bad thing, at least in terms of development theory. I would like to say that in the view of the Secretariat, stepped up aid-in-kind is neither inherently a good thing nor necessarily a bad thing. The questions at issue relate not to goodness or badness in theory but to effectiveness, effectiveness in impact and effectiveness in the use of aid resources which we all recognize as being extremely limited. The Representative of Canada countries. would personally hope that the outcome of the feasibility study will provide concepts, approaches, ways of thinking, ways of analysing that will enable Canada and other donors to take a more comprehensive perhaps more sophisticated approach when examining requests for aid-in-kind in the future. The outcome of the feasibility study in other words and not the Secretariat should provide some of the answers to his questions at this stage. I very much hope that Canada will participate in the work on the study both by providing data and by discussing ideas. Indeed, a healthy scepticism willingness look at the facts, will, I am sure be useful and stimulating for the preparation of the The Representative of Denmark questioned the possibility of using data from other organizations in order to avoid the expense of going to the full feasibility study which we have proposed. There is some fragmentary data available. FAO itself monitors the flow of fertilizer aid. We have also informally made soundings with the World Bank which is ready to provide us with the data in its possession on the flow of input in aid-in-kind. However, that is not really the point. The point is I think, as has been stressed by a number of representatives in the debate, that we are looking not merely at a quantitative analysis but also at a qualitative analysis. -313- The problems are whether aid-in-kind has run into serious problems in the past, what can be its potential for use in the future, and answers to this type of question cannot be derived from a simple analysis of quantitative data. There have been some general questions on coordination. The Director-General has given two examples of how he at his level coordinates the approaches of FAO at the highest level with the United Nations, OAU and other organizations. FAO continues to participate in the work of the United Nations Steering Committee which 1 mentioned this morning and indeed, there will be a meeting of the Steering Committee in New York tomorrow. At national level the Consultative Groups and Round Tables are essentially dealing with macro-economic and I can only confirm FAO is ready to make its sectoral input insofar as it may be requested and useful this broader context. So far as coordination with UNDP is concerned, I would like to refer to the statement made in the debate by the representative of UNDP and to thank him for his very positive intervention. Finally, I would like to comment issue which emerged in the course of the discussion. is the question from the delegate of Pakistan-in effect, why is irrigation not a fifth 'i'? Conceptually water is of course an input. So in a sense water is covered by the four i's. However, the problems and potential associated with irrigation schemes Africa have been analyzed in the study Agriculture: the Next Twenty-Five Years\". 1 shall not recapitulate them now but I would point out that there are serious problems connected with the high cost of irrigation schemes in Africa and there are also problems with the support systems required for the development and operation of such schemes. In part for these reasons the study anticipates that rainfed agriculture will continue to account for about 90 percent of food production in Africa. I think I do not need to comment on any other of the questions raised in the course of what has been an extremely substantial and substantive debate. CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much, Mr Walton. I think this brings us to a point that we need to examine what we need to decide and conclude our deliberations upon. The point that has been raised with regard to the studies embracing more than one region is one that the Director-General feels is left open-ended. In my view, listening different speakers this morning and this afternoon, I thought the consensus was that this kind of study is good for Africa and is good for other regions; therefore since it is going to be done in Africa why should it not be extended to other regions. This is a legitimate desire for other regions to benefit from studies such as the one that we have been discussing. But certainly this does not warrant that additional funds should now be provided so that we have more than $400 000 that have been mentioned throughout. What I thought was that the general understanding of the mood and interventions from Member Countries here is that, let us proceed with the study on Africa and when that is done, then we will look to other regions, and the region that has a request now is Latin America, arising from the regional meeting in Barbados. So in my judgement we should stick to what has been the recommendation by the Director-General and that is, give him the mandate to do the feasibility study as mentioned in the document and then look at the possibility of extending such studies to other regions. I think way of treating this issue, rather than opening up another debate on whether we should now deal with Latin America at this last hour. This is my understanding. Unless there is a conflicting to my understanding? There seems to be no contra view. Therefore, Mr Deputy Director-General, the consensus of this session is that we will give the mandate to the Secretariat and the Director-General to carry out a feasibility study In accordance with the recommendations brought to the Council and that having done that, we will then examine ways and means of extending these studies to other regions when and if it is desires. I would like also to comment on the views that we have received, and I must confess that this is my first time and I am acting as a rookie in the game as it were, but my judgement on the discussions here is based on the fact that this is a democratic institute, and as such we are bound to r eceive a divergence of and we Therefore, we receive slightly different observations from what we expect to be the correct version we should not feel that this is outside the scope of our discussions. Therefore, we always welcome a different point of view and then work on the democratic judgement of the consensus of the majority view. In this case I am alluding to the fact that there were some observations made by Denmark and Canada. In my those views seeking further clarification and refinement of the kind of work that we want to do. I did not get the impression that there was total opposition to the programme that will help Africa feed herself. In that case I would suggest that the Secretariat take into account some of the observations, because they could be of great help in our work, but bearing in mind that the majority view of this Council endorses the study that has been recommended by the Secretariat, by the Director-General, and the recommendations of the Special General Assembly of the United Nations, as well as the Regional Conference of the African States which met in Yamoussoukro. I think, ladies and gentlemen, we have treated this subject properly, as it deserved to be treated. We had altogether 52 speeches, 43 from members of Council and 9 from observers, and the consensus of this a ugust assembly is that we should give full support and mandate to the Secretariat and to the Director-General to carry out the feasibility study in accordance with the terms of reference that appear in paragraph 45 of the paper that we have been discussing. Ladies and gentlemen, 1 am satisfied that we have dealt with all the matters brought to us for our judgement and I am pleased to say that we have reached a conclusion which will give us a push which will answer some of the serious problems that have been posed, but there can never be finality in these matters. We are dealing with one aspect. After the study we will discover that we need to do a little more perhaps. There may be some other issues that will be revealed by the feasibility study and at that time we will have an opportunity to deal with those issues. For the time being, I believe that we now have the support of the Council, and the Director-General can pro ceed with the feasibility study. I thank you very much. I thank you ail for your very kind support for the Chair throughout our discussion.

The Executive Director, Mr Ingram, before he left on duty travel to Pakistan, asked me to convey his regards and best wishes to you. The report before you contains a great amount of detailed information and data on the Programme's activities and accomplishments during last year. I will touch on some of the highlights to put it in perspective. The unprecedented food crisis in Africa and the special attention given to relief the media during 1985. Important and vital as emergency food aid has been, it constituted about a quarter of the Programme's tota l aid in 1985. We continued to use food aid not only to alleviate hunger but to promote development and prevent hunger in the world. In 1985 the Programme committed 642 million dollars of resources to 55 new, as well as ongoing development projects, involving 1. 8 million tons of food. Special attention continued to be paid by WFP to the needs of sub-Saharan Africa to assist in the process of our developm ent assistance committed in 1985. Projects reflected our continuing emphasis on providing support for agriculture development: 78 percent of our development assistance commitments went to projects in these sectors. Globally, in 1985 the Programme was involved in the implementation of over 360 ongoing development projects in 88 countries. The value of its assistance to those projects was around $3.6 billion. The easing of the immediate crisis in sub-Saharan somewhat relieved the pressure on resources devoted to emergency operations in 1985. We co mmitted 230 million dollars to 55 new emergency operations in 32 countries during that year, involving more than 700 000 tons of food and five million dollars in cash subsidies. Our relief activities were not, of course, limited to alone also brought relief to drought-stricken nations, refugees and displaced persons and the victims of natural disasters all over the world. About 11 million people were targeted beneficiaries of WFP emergency food aid approved in 1985. I would like to draw your attention to some of the unprecedented activ ities WFP year in Africa. WFP's Africa Task Force improved and computerized data on food aid pledges and deliveries in Africa, for regular dissemination recipients, allowing for greater in the massive international effort to provide aid. To speed up deliveries in recipient countries, the Task Force provided extra equipment and transport, recruited special teams of experts who monitored ports and transit routes to overcome transportation bottlenecks and, in some cases, the implementation of road and rail repairs and the mobilization of special transport units. These successes were made possible by the financial support of donors, very generous support, I must say the full support we r eceived from African governments and ins titutions, including cooperation of the concerned organizations and agencies in the United Nations system and, last but not least, the dedication and hard work of our staff, both in the field and at Headquarters. -317- With the growth in other types of development assistance stagnating, food aid becomes all the more important as an integral component of international aid. In the 1985-86 biennium, the combined total of resources pledged amounted to 1. 35 For pledges, we r eceived the highest level of contributions in the history of the Programme-over a billion dollars, although this represented only 78 percent of the target. Added to these funds was a dramatic increase in the resources donors to Emergency Food Reserve (IEFR). Contributions to the IEFR in 1985 were more 800 000 tons valued at 224 million dollars, surpassing the target for the third consecutive year. The cash resources coming to the Programme, however, must be increased in relation to the greater operational flexibility. WFP managed the shipment of over 2 million tons of food to 84 countries in 1985, using over 1 800 vessels. Once again, we sought to use vessels from developing countries subject, of course, is, the to 11 percent in 1984. Purchases of food by the Programme in 1985 continued at high levels, amounting to about 58 million dollars, 80 percent of which was used in what we call \"triangular transactions\", a matter in which the governing body is always very interested. As many members of the Council know, the most important development for us in the field of logistics was Programme's first involvement in directly fleets in Chad, the Sudan and Ethiopia to transport food aid. This was a challenge that had to be met on behalf of the international community and we took that challenge. This accomplishment of WFP a to the in dealing with emergencies. in than would have been future It would interest know that the a result of the recommendations of the Joint UN/FAO Task Force. I am pleased to report that this transfer of functions from FAO to WFP took place in a highly cooperative and constructive manner; the new arrangements are and fully As regards WFP's resource situation for the biennium 58 donors far pledged US $624 million, which is forty-five percent of the target. However, all the main donors have not yet pledged. If they maintain their pledges at the levels of the current biennium, we should see a small overall increase in resources available for development over the resources for 1985-86. In conclusion, the work and activities of WFP in 1985, as in previous years, have shown how food aid, perceptively used, can be a most effective investment resource efforts of addressing their immediate needs. I now commend to the FAO Council the Eleventh Annual Report of the CFA, contained in Document CL 90/9, for your consideration. LE Ronald F. R. DEARE (United Kingdom): May I first thank Mr Ahmed for his very comprehensive and interesting introduction. The United Kingdom is of course privileged to be a member of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes and therefore we have had an opportunity to participate in the preparation of this report. In the circumstances I can be reasonably brief in my comments. But I do want to say one or two things, because 1985 was, as Mr Ahmed has reminded us, a momentous year for WFP. As he has said, we have seen in the past year or so the implementation of the report of the UN/FAO Joint Task Force and, as Mr Ahmed has said, this has led to a new relationship which we are pleased to know is working well in a spirit of harmony and close cooperation. I think this Council should congratulate the Director-General and the Executive Director on the way in which this new arrangement has taken shape. Mr Ahmed also referred to WFP's major involvement in the African food crisis and I think that we can all acknowledge that WFP rose manfully to this challenge and valuable which were able to CFA last month. Here again I think congratulations are due to all the staff and management of both WFP and FAO who were involved in this tremendous effort. -318- I would also just like to note the reference in the report to the Executive Director's initiative in instituting a review of WFP's management methods and organizational structure. We believe that all organizations need from time to time to stand back and to review and, if necessary, redefine their objectives and priorities, and we are very glad that WFP has done this. We had a useful first discussion last month in the CFA and we, like other delegations, look forward to receiving the Executive Director's proposals in due course. Today seems to be a for congratulations because I think that congratulations are also due to the Secretary- General and the Director-General for their decision to reappoint Ingram for delegation would like to offer our congratulations to him too. Those are all the congratulations. Now, speaking as the country which has the privilege at the moment of holding the presidency of the European Community, I would just like to draw to the attention of the Council the fact that the European Community Development Council on 11 November reached a common position on a new food aid regulation which I think is of some significance. The main features of this are that food aid will be linked to a much greater extent in future to development aid and development policy. Food aid will conform more closely to the needs of the recipients and there will be a streamlining of procedures to allow food aid to be quickly, especially in can be resolved quickly and that the regulation will be adopted before the end of this year. We believe that these reforms should enable recipients and donors alike to from food aid and I am sure that this is an objective shared by all members of the CFA and of this Council. Ms Anne Marie ESPER-LARSEN (Denmark): The Danish delegation has studied with interest the Annual Report of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes to the Economic and Social Council, the FAO Council and the World Food Council. May I start by thanking Mr Ahmed for his excellent introduction to this document and state that we appreciate the clear and pr ecise way in which the prog ramme's activitie s in 1985 are reported to us in document CL 90/9. Since the Danish delegation in other fora has expressed its opinion on the operation of the World Food Programme in 1985, I only wish to highlight a few points here which we find of importance. With respect to the World Food Programme's development assistance, my delegation notes with satisfaction that WFP in 1985 is its policy of emphasizing commitments to the poorest countries. Out of the total of 1. 8 million tons of food committed 85 percent went to such a high commitment to low-income countries is not an easy task. We commend the programme on this fine record, and of course we encourage it to continue along this route. We also note with satisfaction that in 1985, $499 million, or 78 percent of the total development assistance, went to WFP projects in the agricultural and rural development area. We feel that the work started by WFP in 1985 and the project cycle is of considerable interest and my government is following the development in this area. The Programme's activities under food aid promoting the ro le of women also has my Government's support. Turning to the World Food Programme activities in the emergency area, we should like to commend the programme and its outstanding performance in connection with the African food crisis programme which has responded not only to the requirements for emergency food aid, but has also undertaken an important coordinating responsibility in the areas of information and logistics. The programmes's achievements in this area have greatly alleviating the sufferings of thousands of people. Having said that, I should like to emphasise that my government sees the world food programme mainly as a development agency. We also feel that emergency food aid should be limited to assistance. We like to see emergency situations turned into development activities as early as possible. the case of long lasting refugee situations where emergency food aid is used over a longer period of time, we should like to encourage a better advanced programming of such inputs. we have stated this in the cfa and would also like to repeat this point of view here. We note with concern that the resource situation of the programme is falling short of the pledging targets. it is our basic view that targets should be realistic and it is indeed difficult for the cfa to establish a pledging target for the world food programme one to one-and-a-half years before the appropriate biennium. opinion attaches to the reappointment of Mr Ingram as Executive Director of the World Food Programme for another five-year term, thus ensuring full -319- In conclusion, we reaffirm our continued We look forward to fruitful cooperation with Mr Ingram and his dedicated staff in the coming years. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): El se\u00f1or Ahmed hizo una buena presentaci\u00f3n. Las cifras para 1985, a\u00f1o que comprende este informe indican que 1984 sigue siendo excepcional tal como se desprende de los p\u00e1rrafos 2 y 12. Apoyamos el esfuerzo del PMA por destacar y estimular la funcion de la mujer en los proyectos realizados con la ayuda alimentarla, asi como de incrementar considerablemente el numero de mujeres profesionales, ahora 55 de las cuales se contrataron 6 en 1985. Sobre la asistencia al desarrollo consideramos que la as ignaci\u00f3n en 1985 de 1, 8 millones de toneladas de alimentos es una cifra considerable aunque inferior a la de 1984 pero superior a otros a\u00f1os anteriores. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia reitera su apoyo a la politica de seguir prestando particular atenci\u00f3n a los pa\u00edses menos adelantadosy a aquellos de bajos ingresos con d\u00e9ficit de alimentos, como lo ha dicho recientemente la distinguida colega de Dinamarca. Nos complace que en cuanto al valor en 1985 la asignaci\u00f3n destinada a los paises m\u00e1s pobres haya sido el 79 por ciento superior a la del 76 por ciento en 1984. En cuanto a la distribuci\u00f3n por regiones el p\u00e1rrafo 16 elenca el orden prioritario de asignaci\u00f3n de recursos que pensamos corresponde a una realidad socioecon\u00f3mica y que coloca a Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe en un lugar con el 10 por ciento. Aceptamos la explicaci\u00f3n que se daen el p\u00e1rrafo 17 seg\u00fan el cual la proporci\u00f3n de recursos por regiones puede variar considerablemente de un a\u00f1o a otro y reiteramos nuestro apoyo a la prioridad en favor del Africa Subsahariana. Esta circunstancia podr\u00eda justificar los datos del cuadro en el cual podr\u00eda observarse que el 16 por ciento en 1983 y el 15 por ciento en 1984, en 1985 ha d\\escendido al citado 10 por ciento para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. El Gobierno de Colombia reitera su posici\u00f3n en el sentido de que el programa debe conservar su car\u00e1cter de universalidady de que dentro de las limitaciones impuestas por los recursos y por las justas prioridades se debe asignar igualmente recursos a algunos pa\u00edses de nuestra regi\u00f3n que a\u00fan los requieren, sobre todo para proyectos de desarrollo. La reciente y afortunada evoluci\u00f3n de la CEE en esa politica de acercamiento al desarrollo expresada por el primer orador de esta ma\u00f1ana el se\u00f1or Deare, del Reino Unido, y la actitud constructiva de Dinamarca nos hace pensar que en el futuro esa importante Comunidad y los altruistas y generosos pa\u00edses n\u00f3rdicos van a estar en condiciones de ofrecer recursos para proyectos de desarrollo en pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. Apoyamos la pol\u00edtica del Programa en cuanto a tipo de proyectos dentro de la asignaci\u00f3n para el desarrollo, sin menospreciar los proyectos de desarrollo de los recursos humanos. Consideramos que aquellos de desarrollo agr\u00edcola y rural deben seguir ocupando la atenci\u00f3n principal y que el PMA debe continuar concentrando sus esfuerzos y recursos en los sectores m\u00e1s pobres de la poblaci\u00f3n rural. Otra muestra de est\u00edmulo a la participaci\u00f3n de la mujer-estamos muy feministas esta ma\u00f1ana-est\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n del bienestar de los ni\u00f1os, un poco olvidados, seg\u00fan el p\u00e1rrafo 23, es la cooperaci\u00f3n del PMA con la UNICEF en cursillos pr\u00e1cticos cuya realizaci\u00f3n apoyamos y opinamos que deber\u00edan continuarse en todas las regiones. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia desea destacar su apoyo a la valiosa labor que viene realizando el servicio de evaluaci\u00f3n del PMA, frente al cual estuvo hasta hace poco, con gran competencia, el se\u00f1or Holder a quien nos complace ver esta ma\u00f1ana en el podium. La evaluaci\u00f3n de los proyectos de desarrollo es muy importante para saber si en realidad se cumplen los objetivos de los diversos aspectos esenciales de la labor del programa. El se\u00f1or Ahmed ha se\u00f1alado la importancia de la funci\u00f3n del Programa en las operaciones de urgencia en 1985. Bastar\u00eda se\u00f1alar el caso excepcionalmente eficaz del transporte mediante camiones en Etiop\u00eda. Son ejemplos de superaci\u00f3n en el ofrecimiento de la asistencia que bien se mer ece ese noble pa\u00eds africano. -320- Los datos sobre los recursos del programa indican que la Comunidad Internacional de donantes sigue siendo generosa con el PMA en homenaje a la manera seria, din\u00e1mica y positiva como trabaja el Programa. El p\u00e1rrafo 54 contiene la suma de aportaciones y el nivel sin precedentes en su conjunto. Desafortunadamente nunca se alcanza el objetivo de promesas ordinarias en toda la historia de los 23 a\u00f1os de existencia del PMA. Para 1985/86 el porcentaje del 76 por ciento son los 1 350 millones de d\u00f3lares. Esperamos que para el bienio 1987/88 se logre cumplir el objetivo propuesto y adoptado por los \u00f3rganos rectores de las Naciones Unidas y la FAO sobre la base innovadora de alimentos y efectivo. Este Consejo debe agradecer a los donantes sus generosas aportaciones que han per mitido al PMA en 1985 cumplir los importantes objetivos contenidos en este 11\u00b0 informe y tambi\u00e9n corroborar el llamado que ha hecho el se\u00f1or Ahmed, un llamado cordial y respetuoso, a los donantes actuales y potenciales, sobre todo a los grandes donantes y a toda la comunidad internacional en general para que haga un esfuerzo suplementario a fin de que pueda lograrse totalmente, ojal\u00e1, por primera vez el objetivo para 1987/88. Convendr\u00e1 se\u00f1alar que entre los 92 pa\u00edses donantes muchos son pa\u00edses en desarrollo, algunos de los cuales ahora tambi\u00e9n contribuyen a la RAIE, seg\u00fan el p\u00e1rrafo 56, lo cual a juicio de la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia confirma el esp\u00edritu de solidaridad del Tercer Mundo con la causa de la cooperaci\u00f3n internacional\u00b7 Ya que hablamos de la RAIE la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia piensa que merece destacar en nuestro informe el hecho de que por cuarta vez desde su establecimiento la RAIE ha s uperado las 500 mil toneladas fijadas en el lejano 1974 y ha llegado a m\u00e1s de 800 mil; pero, naturalmente, dada la di f\u00edcil e incierta situaci\u00f3n en todo el mundo este reconocimiento no deber\u00e1 ser pasivo, sino de aliento para que las contribuciones a la RAIE sigan increment\u00e1ndose a fin de permitir al Programa atender debidamente todas las operaciones de urgencia. Este Consejo debe reiterar la importancia de las transacciones triangulares que benefician al pa\u00eds donde se hacen las compras y tambi\u00e9n al destinatario. Son obvios los beneficios que sobre todo los pa\u00edses eficientemente productores del Tercer Mundo obtienen de las transacciones triangulares. El p\u00e1rrafo 64 dice que en 1985 esas transacciones s\u00f3lo representaron el 80 por ciento de las compras de productos, proporci\u00f3n menor que en los a\u00f1os anteriores, si las razones que justifican esa disminuci\u00f3n pueden ser ciertas o aceptables en cierta medida, de todos modos convendr\u00e1 insistir en apoyar una vez m\u00e1s las transacciones triangulares\u00b7 Destacaremos la actitud positiva de los donantes bilaterales que canalizan sus contribuciones a trav\u00e9s del PMA y la mayor\u00eda de las cuales se efect\u00faan mediante transacciones triangulares. Este Consejo debe apoyar la actitud ya positiva asumida por el CPA. Al respecto, la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia piensa que la mayor participaci\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses en desarollo en el transporte es posible y viable. Debe intensificarse para beneficio de aquellos estados del Tercer Mundo que tienen posibilidad de ofr ecer ese transporte y beneficiarse as\u00ed econ\u00f3micamente. El se\u00f1or Ahmed lo dijo, y el p\u00e1rrafo 65 indica que el transporte aument\u00f3 s\u00f3lo muy ligeramente, en un 1 por ciento en relaci\u00f3n con 1984. Pidamos al CPA que insista ante el Director Ejecutivo para que se incremente m\u00e1s consistentemente esa proporci\u00f3n. Una vez m\u00e1s la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia insiste sobre la necesidad y conveniencia de que en el personal del PMA seestablezca una representaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica adecuada, sobre todo a nivel de posiciones pol\u00edticas y de tomas de decisi\u00f3n. Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe est\u00e1n muy mal representados en el personal del PMA en los m\u00e1s altos niveles. Confiamos en que los constantes esfuerzos para mejorar la representaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica del personal de que habla el p\u00e1rrafo 66 se har\u00e1n realidad ya que esto no se cumpli\u00f3 cuando se hizo el reciente aumento del personal del PMA, pero ahora el informe McKinsey ofrecer\u00e1 otra oportunidad de rectificaci\u00f3n de esa situaci\u00f3n injustamente prolongada. A ese respecto, nuestro colega y amigo el Sr. Deare, del Reino Unido, anticip\u00f3 los comentarios sobre la nueva era del PMA. Creo que ha sido conveniente plantear este asunto aunque no haga parte de este informe. Fue tratado en un per\u00edodo de sesiones de este a\u00f1o y estamos tratando del a\u00f1o 1985, pero nosotros creemos que eso es importante y que a ese respecto tambi\u00e9n quisi\u00e9ramos sumar la opini\u00f3n de la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia a la del Reino Unido en favor de la nueva era, de la prolongaci\u00f3n de la luna de miel, de las relaciones de plena cooperaci\u00f3n existentes entre la FAO y el PMA. -321- Debemos dejar constancia de la manera adecuada, inmediata y coherente como el Dr. Saouma, Director General de la FAO, interpreto la voluntad un\u00e1nime del CPA e inmediatamente, de acuerdo con la Secretar\u00eda General de Naciones Unidas, redesign\u00f3 al Sr. Ingram para otros cinco a\u00f1os, noticia que es de grato placer y de verdadera complacencia para la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia. En la ultima reuni\u00f3n del CPA, que concluy\u00f3 hace unos d\u00edas, el Director General de la FAO destac\u00f3 la importancia de la monetizaci\u00f3n (espero que mi colega Sra. Fenwick, quien hasta ahora ha estado complacida con mi declaraci\u00f3n, no vaya a cambiar esta actitud en su rostro siempre sonriente), pero decimos que el Director General se refiri\u00f3 a la monetizaci\u00f3n en determinados proyectos para pa\u00edses que no tienen recursos de contrapartida. El Director Ejecutivo asumi\u00f3 la afortunada actitud innovadora de presentar cuatro de esta clase de proyectos de completa monetizaci\u00f3n que fueron aprobados por el CPA en su ultima reuni\u00f3n. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia piensa que este Consejo debe apoyar la posici\u00f3n del Director Ejecutivo y pedir al Director Ejecutivo que siga presentando esos proyectos y al CPA que no vacile en refrendar el buen principio de la completa monetizaci\u00f3n cuando \u00e9sta sea necesaria y conveniente. Como lo hab\u00eda previsto, noto que mi colega la Sra. Fenwick de los Estados Unidos ha pasado al frente de su delegaci\u00f3n, pero justamente para eso estamos en esta Sala Roja, para adelantar un di\u00e1logo seguramente constructivo. Finalmente, Sr. Presidente, nos complace el felicitar al colega y amigo Haratel H stmark, de Noruega, ahora observador de su pa\u00eds en este Consejo, pero siempre activo y din\u00e1mico representante de ese importante pa\u00eds n\u00f3rdico. El Sr. Hstmark presidi\u00f3 con eficacia y competencia los dos per\u00edodos de sesiones del CPA que comprende este und\u00e9cimo informe. Quedamos en espera de la reacci\u00f3n de nuestra colega Fenwick. de los Estados Unidos y agradecemos a Ud. y a los miembros del Consejo la atenci\u00f3n que ofrezcan a esta humilde declaraci\u00f3n de la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I cannot resist my dear colleague from Colombia. Of course, there is nothing humble about what he said, and there should not be, because as a rule he reads every paragraph of the report. I regret to say that usually I am not very technical, but I think he did not quite get to the last paragraph, number 77, in which there is reference to what he has given reproach to our colleague from the United Kingdom. I think if he gets to the end and reads paragraph 77 he will find that that subject is covered there. What I should like to say seriously is that this monetization has been carefully gone into in the CFA. It was discussed at length and it was agreed that we should have a policy paper on this whole matter to be drawn up and clearly outlined before the next CFA. So I think that that matter has been handled in a very good way. Of course, we are in favour of project food aid rather than programme food aid, and we were not the only delegation that was concerned about this development of monetization in the CFA. My colleague will have other things to say in our serious intervention. This was just an intervention, you might say, by courtesy of Colombia. Wu TIANXI (China) (Ori ginal language Chinese): In the past year WFP provided $300 million dollars worth of emergency and development aid for the sub-Saharan region in Africa, contributing significantly to easing the African food crisis. It continued to implement the policy of using food aid for and helped the poverty stricken areas carry out food-for-work projects in which the construction of infrastructures for agriculture formed a major part. Thus conditions for production in these areas were improved and agricultural production enhanced. At the same time, WFP devoted tremendous efforts to the development of human resources and provided emergency food aid for millions of refugees. All these accomplishments were duly reflected in the 11th annual report of CFA. We are satisfied with these achievements and we appreciate what WFP has done to make all these possible. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to WFP and CFA for their efforts in the past year in approving China's projects on agriculture, fishery and forestry. These projects are now being implemented in China, which will play a positive role and the agro-ecological environment upgrading its in stitutional management, promoting triangular transactions, in fully tapping the material potentials of the developing countries, and in revising its projects cycle. We have realized that the new project cycle will help to designing and project management efficiency and increase project returns from the experience we have gained. While there is need for the project areas to prepare materials and -322- counterpart investment and manpower, there is also the need for them to do a good job in project design and management so as to achieve optimum results. As we share a common goal, fully appreciates and supports the steps taken by WFP improve its management and is ready to join efforts with the Programme in future cooperation for better development. Michel MOMBOULI (Congo): Avant de faire part au Conseil f\u00e9licitations \u00e0 M. James Ingram, par le Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Nations Unies et par le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la FAO, un nouveau mandat de cinq ans.

Ahmed lui fasse a Comit\u00e9 des politiques PAM dont nous sommes saisis au titre du point 7. 1 de du jour sous la cote pays sur les diff\u00e9rentes questions abord\u00e9es dans ce rapport qui nous est soumis.

REDL (Austria): I would like to thank the Secretariat for the timely submission of document CL 90/9. My thanks are addressed to Mr Ahmed for the excellent and comprehensive introduction of this item. The document gives a good survey of the activities of the World Food Programme. We welcome its activities concerning the coordination of the aid mechanism and still see the possibilities for some improvement. The statement in paragraph 14 said that 85 percent of the total of 1. 8 million tons of food benefitted the low income food deficit countries and was noted with satisfaction. The same applies to paragraph 15 saying that an essential part of the WFP development support was directed to the LDCs. Concerning the regional support it was remarked with satisfaction that the various recommendations were taken into account and the African region was given high priority. Concerning the food aid and the role women the closest possible cooperation with needed to avoid duplication. The outlook for 1986, paragraph 7, 4 to 77, should be completed by recent data since the year 1986 will end in a few weeks. Even the question arises whether this section should is already available. Furthermore, it would be desirable if the document an outlook on the prio rities in 1987. Finally, it is a pleasure for me to underline once again the full support of my gove rnment Comit\u00e9 des politiques et programmes d'aide alimentaire du et en importante dans l'histoire du PAM et dans l'\u00e9volution de ses politiques et programmes. Au cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1985, le PAM a jou\u00e9 un rele de premier plan dans la distribution de l'aide alimentaire d'urgence en pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 son Comit\u00e9 coordination, le Comit\u00e9 des politiques et programmes d'aide alimentaire, et nous nous en r\u00e9jouissons. Nous nous r\u00e9jouissons \u00e9galement de la nomination pour une nouvelle p\u00e9riode de cinq ans de M. Saouma, et le Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Nations Unies, m\u00eame qu'au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 1986, par le PAM clarifier par le Groupe de et des Nations Unies devrait faciliter les relations entre le PAM et la le organisme. m\u00eame et sujet de la que cette question est importante et examen Nous l'efficience de ses nous pouvons constater Nous esp\u00e9rons que, dans l'esprit libres de commentaires, dans un d\u00e9mocratique rappelait programme, tel qu'il nous est possible de le faire dans le cadre du Comit\u00e9 des politiques et programmes collaboration du PAM et de la FAO. Agust\u00edn GUTIERREZ-CANET (M\u00e9xico): La delegaci\u00f3n mexicana felicita al se\u00f1or Ahmed por la presentaci\u00f3n sintetica y clara del documento en el que se exponen las actividades del programa Mundial de ALimentos durante 1985. Observamos con preocupaci\u00f3n que la disponibilidad de r ecursos en alimentos en 1985 fue inferior en un 14 por ciento al de 1984; pero tambi\u00e9n fue mayor que en a\u00f1os anteriores. Por otra parte, observamos que del total de 6 42 millones de d\u00f3lares asignados para proyectos de desarrollo, el 79 por ciento fue dedicado a dar atenci\u00f3n a pa\u00edses menos adelantados de conformidad con el espiritu del PMA y del propio Comit\u00e9. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n apoya totalmente esa pol\u00edtica de prestar particular atenci\u00f3n a los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos, pero al mismo tiempo lamenta, como ya ha sido se\u00f1alado por el distinguido representante de Colombia, el desequilibrio en la distribuci\u00f3n. regional. En este sentido la Regi\u00f3n Latinoamericana y del Caribe apenas alcanz\u00f3 un 10 por ciento de las asignaciones del PMA. Esto es as\u00ed, no obstante los grandes bolsones de pobreza que se presentan en la regi\u00f3n y a pesar del deterioro de la crisis econ\u00f3mica derivada fundamentalmente del peso de la deuda y de los problemas de mercado de los productos b\u00e1sicos. Insistimos en la n ecesidad de alcanzar un adecuado equ ilibrio en la distribuci\u00f3n regional y esperamos que sin menoscabo de atender prioritariamente a los pa\u00edses menos avanzados, se atienda m\u00e1s responsablemente a nuestra regi\u00f3n. La delegaci\u00f3n mexicana desea, igualmente, destacar la pronta y efectiva respuesta que el PMA otorg\u00f3 al pueblo hermano de El Salvador inmediatamente despu\u00e9s del terremoto ocurrido en ese pais el 10 de octubre pasado. De igual forma hace poco m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o el PMA brind\u00f3 su asistencia a nuestro pais pos una causa similar, por lo que mi delegaci\u00f3n reitera su reconocimiento al Programa. Por otra parte, se\u00f1or Presidente, apoyamos la implantaci\u00f3n de los trabajos sobre el llamado Ciclo Revisado de los Proyectos, cuyo objetivo es incrementar la eficacia del desarrollo de los recursos destinados por el PMA. Nos complace los esfuerzos realizados por el PMA en su labor de coordinaci\u00f3n -325- interagencial para lograr una mayor eficiencia entre los diversos mecanismos de la ayuda alimentaria. La eficiencia del programa ha sido demostrada en m\u00faltiples pa\u00edses de Africa, particularmente en Etiop\u00eda, y tambi\u00e9n ha quedado demostrada dicha eficiencia a nivel de Grupos Consultivos en los planes de programas y de desarrollo. Apoyamos tambi\u00e9n al programa en lo referente a promover una mayor conciencia de la funci\u00f3n que las mujeres pueden y deben desempe\u00f1ar en los proyectos realizados con ayuda alimentaria, ya que la mujer, particularmente en el \u00e1rea rural, desempe\u00f1a un papel fundamental dentro de la organizaci\u00f3n agricola en muchos pa\u00edses. La delegaci\u00f3n mexicana expresa su satisfacci\u00f3n por los logros alcanzados en materia de coordinaci\u00f3n entre el PMA y la FAO derivada del Grupo de Acci\u00f3n Conjunta Naciones Unidas/FAO. Asimismo espera que esta Acci\u00f3n Conjunta a la que se han comprometido sus m\u00e1ximas autoridades, se consolide en pro de una mayor eficacia. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n aplaude a la comunidad de donantes que se ha comprometido, conforme a la propuesta del CPA, en obtener 3, 25 millones de toneladas y 405 millones de d\u00f3lares en efectivo para el bienio 1987-88. La delegaci\u00f3n mexicana insta al Director Ejecutivo del PMA a que haga lo posible por diversificar los contenidos de la ayuda alimentarla e incluya en \u00e9sta productos que no trastoquen los h\u00e1bitos alimenticios de las poblaciones beneficiarias. Asimismo solicitamos se fomenten las transacciones triangulares a fin de ayudar a los paises en desarrolloa a colocar sus excedentes alimenticios. Hemos coincidido en otro tema de nuestra agenda en que, aunque nos congratulamos de que existan tales excedentes en varios pa\u00edses africanos, sus consecuencias econ\u00f3micas de no ser colocados a tiempo pueden ser negativas. Pedimos al PMA, por tanto, que. estudie el caso de esos pa\u00edses africanos y de otros en circunstancias similares para que les ofrezca una salida a trav\u00e9s de operaciones triangulares. Para ellos seria conveniente que el PMA utilizara en la mayor medida posible los servicios de transporte de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. En general la asistencia alimentaria debe otorgarse de tal manera que no s\u00f3lo permita la soluci\u00f3n de casos urgentes de falta de alimentos, sino que tambi\u00e9n establezca las bases para una adecuada producci\u00f3n local de alimentos y estimule un crecimiento econ\u00f3mico m\u00e1s s\u00f3lido. Finalmente, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n quiere dejar constancia de su satisfacci\u00f3n por el nombramiento del doctor Ingram, por un nuevo periodo de cinco a\u00f1os a cargo del PMA. Mrs Marasee SURAKUL (Thailand): First of all my delegation would like to join the other speakers to congratulate Mr Ingram on his appointment for another term as Executive Director. On behalf of the Thai delegation I would like to express our appreciation of the report of the UN/FAO World Food Programme. I would like to refer to the report CL 90/9 regarding the relief operations for Kampucheans. My delegation would like to thank the World and Thai Government has decided to pledge a contribution of white rice of the amount of US$70 000 for the period of 1987 and 1989. My delegation also appreciated that the World Food Programme has purchase comit\u00e9s programmes alimentaires qui vient de se tenir \u00e0 Rome, de dire son appr\u00e9ciation pour les efforts men\u00e9s par le PAM dans l'ensemble des pays en d\u00e9veloppement et plus particuli\u00e8rement sur le continent africain crise Le PAM de l'efficience et de la de afin de faire grand public ne retient par le PAM que de secouriste. en la d'un renforcement de l'autosuffisance alimentaire des en d\u00e9veloppement. Nous nous r\u00e9jouissons que, dans cette perspective pour 1986, le document CL 90/19 marque l'intention PAM de \"viser une int\u00e9gration accrue l'aide alimentaire dans les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires\". Il n'est pas inutile d'ajouter la Commission de Bruxelles. Le Directeur ex\u00e9cutif du PAM nous a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans terme afin d'am\u00e9liorer encore la performance de cette organisation. Ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu l'occasion services Federal Republic of):We have the Eleventh Annual Report of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes before us. This report contains a number of interesting facts and figures relating to the year 1985 which are relevant also for the future of the World Food Programme. Since the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany has already appreciated the work of WFP I should like to make only some brief remarks at this time. The activities of WFP are divided into two major categories, i. e. development assistance through food aid, and emergency operations. With regard to the development assistance WFP has entered into what is called the Based past experiences, projects and programmes be more clearly incorporated in country frameworks and represent the outcome of better coordination between the country involved and the different multilateral and bilateral donors. Furthermore, an improved project design will be applied definition of food as a project resource is asked for as well as a more active participation of WFP in World new endeavour but would also like to raise a point of caution level of expectations. Such structural changes certainly provide a better base but activities in the projects and programmes depend mostly on the cooperation of administration of the recipient country on the spot and, most importantly, on the participation of the people in planning and implementation. In this connexion let me stress, like delegations my delegation fully supports the involvement of women in the whole process. The role of women, especially in the poor sectors of the population, has too often been overlooked in the past. This resulted in has improved its handling of emergencies. New approaches were found and efficiently implemented. The coordination within the international community and on the spot has been improved through OEOA and the United Nations System, mainly Resident constructive engagement, be it in the multilateral field; be it in channelling bilateral or NGO's assistance to the needy. We are pleased with the quick and efficient response of WFP to the situation in sub-Sahara Africa, willingness to explore new ways and means, for instance the trucking operations in Ethiopia and the as well as incorporation of NGOs activ efforts of international community. Whilst the target set for the combined total resources of WFP have not been met in full, we have to acknowledge that the resources made available to WFP are impressive sign of This also holds true for the resources provided for in the International Emergency Food Reserve which have exceeded the target set over the last four years. It is especially welcomed that At this point I would like to express the full satisfaction of my Government regarding those transactions carried out on our behalf. This mode of operation will be continued whenever feasible, relying on WFP's past experience and correct responses to expressed needs. The of the UN/FAO Joint Task Force has proven efficient. We are glad to learn that almost all recommendations have been implemented and a fair base fo r costing of FAO support activ ities has been established. We are looking forward further discussions on the restructuring of WFP Headquarters in order to give it a more field-oriented impetus. A first exchange of views based on the McKinsey Report has already 22nd are confident that WFP's administration has due note of the comments made in CFA. -327- All of us are stakeholders in WFP and therefore must be interested in an efficient and an innovative organization which is able to handle its specific mandate and the second largest resources per year in the United Nations System in the interest of the people it is dealing with, mainly the poorest parts of the population in same time assurances of an business. are to discussing the general question of monetization of WFP's food aid. Before WFP gets involved in this kind of action on a large scale two questions have to be scrutinized very carefully. Firstly, what are the potential effects of food aid sold on the market and how can the counterpart funds be used to contribute to the development process of the country? Secondly, what could or should be the role of WFP within this context? For my government this will be an important point of discussion concerning the future work of WFP. Ross COGGINS (United States of America): We are very happy to see Mr Ahmed and Mr Holder on the platform and we would like to compliment Mr Ahmed on his effective presentation of the 11th Annual Report of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes. It is always a pleasant task to commend not in response to the required diplomatic niceties but in recognition of solid accomplishment. There is much in the report which is worthy of comment but in the interest of brevity we would like to focus on just two or three points. My delegation is pleased to commend WFP's magnificent response to characterized by timeliness, determination effectiveness. The highly professional to the widespread and sustained potential faced with emergency. We further commend what is in the report on the programme strategy for both accelerating the integration of activities. Devising is essential first task but the harder task of carrying out strategy lies fervent hope that it will be effec tive long before the project ed date of the year 2000. Having commended the programme for these achievements, my delegation to offer a promisory note for future commendation. We are following recently the serious of my delegation that in the most recent CFA there were tendencies to move away from project food aid in the direction of programme food aid as evidenced by submission for CFA four fully monetarized projects. As Ambassador Fenwick stated when the United States and other delegations expressed their concern regarding this perceived trend, it was agreed that there would be a full policy My delegation believes that the programme, which according report us has achieved such commendable objectives in the recent past, w ill win future commendation by stu bbornly continuing to focus its resources on the beneficiaries in the poorest population sectors on their food security, which is basic, and on their deepest aspirations for a better life. Augustine K. OSUBAN (Uganda): First we wish to convey our congratulations to Mr James Ingram on his appointment as Executive Director of the WFP for a further term of five years. The WFP under Mr Ingram's leadership has achieved high recognition in the international account of its excellent work in developing countries. We wish him greater achievements during his second term of office. Turning now to the document before us, I would like to thank Mr Ahmed for his excellent introduction and his detailed account of how food aid can be used as a valuable developmental source in alleviating and as a long-term measure for rehabilitating agriculture and economic development. We would like to commend the World Food Programme for the tremendous work carried out globally but especially for its involvement in the African food crisis. In this crisis the World Food Programme achieved a standard of performance of which we are all proud, given the odds and harsh logistic problems to perform its My delegation welcomes the high level of WFP commitments for development projects, reported to be equivalent to 1. 8 million tons of food, and we also welcome the orientation of the programmes towards agricultural production and rural development. -328- In the same way we also note with appreciation that some proportion of the total project values was commuted to supporting price stabilization programmes. We would welcome more of these projects because, as pointed out, they exemplify the innovative role that food aid can play in supporting agricultural reforms. With regard to emergency operations, we commend the performance of the programme for the high level of WFP commitment to emergency operations and we especially appreciate the speed of delivery of its emergency supplies, as testified by the swiftness with which emergency supplies were delivered to Colombia. We note with appreciation that for the fourth time since the inseption of the International Emergency Food Reserve, the target of 500, 000 tons of cereals has been reached an d that most of it was channelled multilaterally through the WFP. We note with appreciation also that 80 percent of the purchases were in the form of triangular transactions. We commend this trend, especially as it is of on the podium is very conspicuous. On the question of non-food items, ray delegation feels that these are very crucial inputs which could easily make the difference between success and failure of the project. We therefore call for more of these items to be procured. We note with great appreciation the very cordial working relationship between WFP and FAO. Both organizations working in harmony to bring great benefits to the developing countries. Finally, I wish on behalf of my delegation to thank the World Food Programme for the substantial assistance that the Organization is giving to our country. In conclusion, we endorse the report. Igor KIPMAN (Brazil): The report before us is a sound reflection of the responsible and serious work which has been under way in the context of the work of the World Food Programme under the guidance of the CFA. Not only has the World Food Programme for more than a decade been doing an outstanding job in trying to relieve hunger and malnutrition, but also searching for and innovative ways to fulfill its tasks. My delegation has no special remarks to make but two of the features presented should specially commended relevant issues and also the willingness to be up to date through the modernization of its working techniques and abilities. The first is a comment on the participation of women in the implementation and operation of food aid assistance which in brief depicts the increasing importance being paid to the role of women in the implementation of development programmes. The second aspect of the report which I would like to underline is the remarkable job being coordinated by the World Food Programme which is shortly and modestly disclosed in page 12 of the document. It is an extraordinary operation, the fruit of the cooperation and coordination of various international agencies, aiming needy is an excellent example of the capacity of the World Food Programme to tackle different problems with imaginative and creative approaches. Regarding triangular transactions and monetarization, I want to endorse the pertinent comments just voiced by Ambassador to and delegations when the policy of monetarization is brought to the next session of the CFA. A last remark is to mention that the report which is now submitted to the Council well demonstrates the reason why the Executive Director has been so strongly and unanimously supported in the last session of the CFA, when all member countries pleaded for his appointment for a further term of office as head of the programme. -329- Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Democratic Republic of) (Original language Arabic):Like previous speakers, I too would like to express our pleasure and satisfaction at the very clear presentation by Dr Ahmed of the 11th Annual Report of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes. My country's delegation would also like to express its admiration at all that has been done by WFP and all that has been explained by Dr Ahmed. We find that the whole report is worthy of praise, in particular as regards the measures undertaken to cope with the food crisis in Africa so far as logistics and distribution are concerned. I think that the success of these endeavors is the untiring undertaken WFP. I would like to commend the competence of the staff both at the headquarters and in the field, who w ithout exception displayed patience and diligence in implementing projects would never have been able to reach such a high degree of success without the hard work of its staff. My country's delegation would like to express its appreciation to donor countries for all the aid that they have been kind enough to offer to WFP. We should WFP sure will reflect positively on activities. We also like Mr Ingram on his reelection to a further terra of office. The Council, the Secretary General of the UN and the Director-General of FAO have given their support to his reelection. Mr Ingram's enthusiasm for and devotion to his task in the past will, I am sure, be maintained in the future. Undoubtedly, this will lead to an improvement in WFP's activities and to a greater mobilization and better use of resources. We should like to pay tribute to the WFP for all that it has done in order to maximize the utilisation of available resources in 1985, and to promote the role of women in development. We also thank WFP for all that it has done in order to encourage more pledges which have reached record levels. My delegation has read carefully what the WFP has been doing in order to improve the distribution of aid according to development requirements. A WFP mission is currently visiting my country. Turning now to the policy to be followed by WFP in the future. We should like to the programme's orientation namely to provide assistance to solve the world food crisis. We are very much aware of the role of food aid in development and especially in the light of the present crisis. We look forward to activating this role through better use of resources of WFP so as to achieve its objectives in development and in providing food aid to low income food-deficit countries particularly (Original Arabic):We have studied document CL 90/9 and we should like to express our satisfaction with the developments in the WFP especially insofar as raising the efficiency of resources allocated to development projects in 1985, as well as efforts exerted in further improving monitoring systems We also happy to see that pledges to the WFP regular 54 and 55 indicate that the WFP resources for the 1985/86 biennium have reached $1. 35 billion; and that 76 percent of the target has been reached. This is a source of satisfaction to us. We are also happy that paragraph 56 of the report indicates that the target for IEFR was exceeded for the first time since it was set up. We also support the importance given by the WFP to purchases through triangular transactions. We read with satisfaction in paragraph 64 that 80 percent of the WFP's purchases the also like to commend WFP aid to Africa and we welcome the Executive Director's inclination to review the administrative structure of the programme. WFP aid has continued to accelerate agricultural development in my country, that is why we should like to pay tribute to the WFP and its assistance. We should also like to thank Mr Salahuddin Ahmed for his clear presentation of this document. We should like to on his reelection. du PAM, pour CL 90/9, relatif des Nations Unies et le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la FAO lui ont exprim\u00e9e en lui renouvelant son mandat \u00e1 la t\u00eate pour les 1985 record dollars, bien que Secr\u00e9taire des Unies; ces r\u00e9sultats ont permis un probl\u00e9me qui nous a un certain temps dans le pass\u00e9.

RYAN (Australia): I shall be very brief in my comments. We would like to thank the Secretariat for the preparation of the document we have before us on this item. Australia regards the work undertaken by the World Food Programme in 1985 as being sensible and appropriate, and considers that the policies and objectives the part of the Programme. We are confident that under the leadership of Jim Ingram the quality value of WFP's of either abroad. This is a widespread national trait on the part of Australians. However, I can say that Australia is quietly proud to have an Australian national of the calibre of Jim Ingram as the head of this most important UN body. He embarks on his second term of office with Australia's strong support and best wishes. -331- Leopoldo Ariza HIDALGO (Cuba): Queremos ante todo, se\u00f1or Presidente, agradecer a la Secretaria por la presentaci\u00f3n del documento, as\u00ed como al se\u00f1or Ahmed por la inteligente y eficaz exposici\u00f3n que nos hizo. Nuestro gobierno felicit\u00f3 calurosamente al Secretario General de Naciones Unidas y al Director General de la FAO por la decisi\u00f3n de designar por un nuevo mandato al Sr. Ingram, lo que garantizar\u00e1 la continuaci\u00f3n de una pol\u00edtica eficiente. El se\u00f1or Ingram con su dinamismo ha ido perfeccionando los mecanismos paso a paso de un Programa de mucha importancia para el mundo en desarrollo. Ha funcionado con un alto sentido en toda su gesti\u00f3n. Para nosotros esto tiene una gran importancia y en el desempe\u00f1o de todas las labores del Programa. Queremos expresar tambi\u00e9n nuestra complacencia por ver en el podium, junto al Se\u00f1or Ahmed a los se\u00f1ores Sintobin y Holder, cuyas capacidades garantizan la ejecuti\u00f3n. control y evaluaci\u00f3n, con el mismo dinamismo e inteligencia que este Organismo ha demostrado en los \u00faltimos tiempos. Los elementos que se brindan en este informe son ilustrativos de la actividad desplegada por el PMA en el ultimo per\u00edodo. La ayuda alimentaria gracias al PMA ha llegado a los lugares m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles, distantes y n ecesitados. Esta ayuda no ha sido equitativa, tenemos que expresarlo, por regiones. Am\u00e9rica Latina como siempre ha sido la que menos ayuda recibi\u00f3, s\u00f3lo un 10 por ciento. No obstante vemos con satisfacci\u00f3n que la cifra de ayuda del bienio es sobresaliente, a pesar de que no se cumplieron las promesas. Consideramos muy importante la atenci\u00f3n que viene brindando el PMA a los proyectos de desarrollo, recogidos en el p\u00e1rrafo 21. Es cuesti\u00f3n indispensable preparar a los pa\u00edses para el futuro y no s\u00f3lo para una situaci\u00f3n determinada o coyuntural de emergencia y de hambre. Sobre los proyectos de desarrollo creo que se va a tener que hacer un an\u00e1lisis muy profundo. Hemos o\u00eddo ya oposiciones a una cierta monetizaci\u00f3n dentro de estos proyectos. Esto nos preocupa porque, sencillamente los mismos que nos han estado diciendo durante muchos a\u00f1os que la monetizaci\u00f3n era una expresi\u00f3n ya de desarrollo, ahora, cuando queremos introducirlo dentro de los mecanismos de desarrollo de los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo, tienen preocupaci\u00f3n con la monetizaci\u00f3n. Nosotros sabemos en estas contradiciones cu\u00e1l es el objetivo final de oponerse a la monetizaci\u00f3n. Esto ser\u00e1 discutido con m\u00e1s tiempo. El PMA ha sido sufientemente agudo para hacer de la ay uda alimentaria un instrumento de desarrollo, ya en estos momentos, sin mucha monetizaci\u00f3n. Diversificando mecanismos y formas y algunos objetivos de proyectos. Aqu\u00ed es donde nosotros expresamos que han sido creativos e inteligentes y que ha funcionado de acuerdo con las necesidades de los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo que son los beneficiados directos del Programa. Esta es una de nuestras mayores satisfacciones y que nosotros hemos apoyado en todas sus partes la gesti\u00f3n del se\u00f1or Ingram y del programa en su conjunto. Finalmente, se\u00f1or Presidente, queremos expresar que el PMA ha cumplido el mandato que la Comunidad Internacional ha puesto en su mano a trav\u00e9s del Secretario General de las Naciones Unidas y del Director General. Ha administrado bien. Ha garantizado la acci\u00f3n multilateral, muy importante, en momentos en que hay que luchar contra viento y marea de aqu\u00e9llos que tratan de erosionarla interesados normalmente en que el bilateralismos sea la \u00fanica v\u00eda. El PMA ha sido un buen contenedor de eso. Ha garantizado la universalidad, ha mantenido en estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os de crisis profunda en todo el mundo, sus labores han sido intensas y fruct\u00edferas, espec\u00edficamente en trabajos en la ayuda a Africa, en su dram\u00e1tica situaci\u00f3n. Todo esto, se\u00f1or Presidente, hace que el PMA sea uno de los instrumentos m\u00e1s importantes del Sistema para apoyar a los pa\u00edses en los momentos de crisis que vivimos. A. K. M. Kamaluddin CHOUDHURY (Bangladesh): First of all, I should like to express the sincere appreciation of the Bangladesh delegation to the Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director of WFP for the excellent introduction of the document WFP/CFA: 21/23 containing the Eleventh Annual Report of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes to the Economic and Social Council, the FAO Council and World Food Council. It is a report which has been prepared with the usual thoroughness and clarity of the WFP. We should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Ingram on his reappointment for a second term of office. We hope that under his leadership the World Food Programme will be further consolidated and that programme expansion will take place. Bangladesh is a beneficiary of the programme of world food assistance and, as a low-income food-deficit country, we have always welcomed it. It is no doubt a very imp ortant supplemen t to the national efforts mobilized by my achieving food the recent meetings of CFA my delegation had the privilege pu tting on record the important role that WFP is playing not only in my country but also in all the countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa in fighting the scourge of hunger and malnutrition. We are grateful to the members of the CFA for the confidence they have posed in Bangladesh by giving us a role in activities during food faced by that continent has received universal acclaim. Nearly 300 million dollars has been spent by WFP in the African food crisis. It is a matter of great satisfaction for my delegation to see that WFP played such an important role in the distribution of emergency food aid in Africa. Ever since the inception of IEFR, WFP assistance countries for their generous contributions in the programme, and we hope in future years the contribution will not only be maintained but will increase in quantum. In this connection, we welcomed WFP efforts in promoting triangular transactions. In find contributions channelled through WFP by bilateral donors 60 percent of the programme's total purchase, most of which have been carried out through triangular transactions. We are highly countries has been continued. It is a matter of great satisfaction to find that of the total 1. 8 million tons of food committed, 85 percent went to the low-income is a strong emphasis on the WFP Programme on the Rural Areas and more specifically on the neediest group of the rural population, particularly small farmers on marginal land, landless workers, primary school children in the village schools, pregnant and nursing mothers. We hope that in the coming years the programme will be further extended and further improved. My delegation is particularly happy to note the increasing level of cooperation and collaboration between the WFP and FAO. We share the comments made by the representative of Colombia in this regard and we hope that in the future the cooperation will be further extended. We are pleased to note that serious efforts were made in 1985 to step up WFP's participation in aid coordination mechanisms such consultative group and UNDP Round Tables. In our view, this is the best possible way of integrating food aid along with other forms of assistance into national development programmes. We are confident that as a result of an integrated approach supported by the ongoing review of management methods the WFP will be able in a more effective manner. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Nicaragua desea, se\u00f1or Presidente, hacer una breve intervenci\u00f3n sobre este tema. Nicaragua no es miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Pol\u00edticas y Programas de Ayuda alimentaria del PMA, pero como observadores seguimos siempre con inter\u00e9s el desarrollo y las conclusiones de sus reuniones. Consideramos que la ayuda alimentaria constituye un sost\u00e9n valido a los esfuerzos que hacemos los pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo para implementar estrategias o planes nacionales de desarrollo. En este sentido tanto la ayuda alimentaria de emergencia como la ayuda alimentaria de apoyo a proyectos de desarrollo son n ecesarios y complementarios en muchos de nuestros pa\u00edses, ya que las luchas nacionales planificadas contra el hambre y la desnutrici\u00f3n se encuentran limitadas algunas v eces por situaciones coyunturales de emergencia Durante el CPA de octubre pasado tuvimos la satisfacci\u00f3n de conocer que el se\u00f1or Ingram, Director Ejecutivo del PMA, fue reelegido para ocupar ese cargo por otros cinco a\u00f1os a partir de abril de 1987\u00b7 Tambi\u00e9n hemos le\u00eddo con sumo inter\u00e9s en el documento 90/9, que las relaciones de cooperaci\u00f3n entre la FAO y el PMA son fluidas. Este hecho s\u00f3lo puede beneficiar a los pa\u00edses en desarrollo e instamos al PMA y a la FAO a intensificar esa cooperaci\u00f3n. El PMA ha jugado un papel esencial durante la crisis alimentaria que ha atravesado el Africa subsahariana, y ha adquirido experiencias valiosas para tratar de superar las deficiencias encontradas para llegar efectivamente y a tiempo a los beneficiarios. Creemos que la superaci\u00f3n de la crisis alimentaria en Africa subsahariana permitir\u00e1 al PMA a asignar mayores recursos a otras regiones en desarrollo, particularmente a la regi\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe que est\u00e1 atravesando hoy d\u00eda una crisis econ\u00f3mica que ha afectado sensiblementesu capacidad de producir alimentos, y el peso de la deuda externa no le permite importar alimentos suficientes para toda la poblaci\u00f3n. El PMA, puede entonces, apoyar en mayor medida los esfuerzos nacionales de los pa\u00edses de nuestra regi\u00f3n para tratar de alcanzar la autosuficiencia alimentaria. -333- Deseamos tambi\u00e9n expresar que el PMA debe continuar manteniendo su universalidad y su multilateralidad en la asignaci\u00f3n de la ayuda alimentaria que, como ya hemos expresado, la consideramos ayuda para el desarrollo, puesto que hemos notado con preocupaci\u00f3n en al CPA pasado que elementos pol\u00edticos perturbadores tienden a condicionar los proyectos que la Secretar\u00eda del ?MA somete al Comit\u00e9 para su aprobaci\u00f3n. Kosei SHIOZAWA (Japan):I should like to say that ray delegation have no difficulty in endorsing the 11th Annual Report of the CFA us. My government highly appreciates the activities of WFP in food and traditional improvement in the developing countries as well as emergency food aid. My country will continue to a contribution Co WFP despite the constraints on the home government. Regarding the monetizacion of food aid, we welcome the fact that the coming CFA is going Co have a full policy discussion, since we have particular concern on this matter. I would like to associate myself with the previous speakers in congratulating Mr Ingram on his appointment for the second term as Executive Director of WFP. Mohammed Hasan PAIMAN (Afghanistan):I would like to give enlightenment on the situation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan which has been mentioned as being over 2 million in number, (page 10 of the document CL 90/9). Under the name of the so-called \"Afghanistan refugees\" they are receiving most of the WFP aid annually. In order to give the clear facts on this matter my delegation believes that with regards to the Afghan Nationals, who are now residing on the territory of Pakistan, it has been admitted in Reports from various sources are otherwise considered as most reliable by the Pakistanis) that there has been an enormous exaggeration of their number. This exaggeration is due factors:-Firstly, a great majority of Afghan nomads, who travel every year deep into the territory of Pashtoons, Baluchs and beyond, travel seasonally for the grazing of their animals. Their crossing of the borders has been registered by the Pakistan authorities as refugees. Secondly, in order to secure more assistance, the number of the household of each refugee family is double-ruling and reported as actual number. Thirdly, considerably large number of the local population, who belong to the same tribal and ethnic groups residing on the other side of the \"frontier\", are also listed as refugees. Fourthly, during the past seven years since the inception of a new phase of the revolution, a great number of Afghans have returned to their home towns and villages. However, their names still remain on the list of those who are allegedly recipients of International assistance. Fifthly, there are some traditionally for business purposes who also undergoing military training in numerous camps located on the territory of Pakistan are also listed as refugees. These factors, together with others, have been widely reported in the international media friendly towards Pakistan. Even the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, report to the to these factors, borrows the numbers of refugees the official record of the government of Pakistan. Although the status of those Afghans who can be considered as bona fide refugees has been obscured by such a deceitful conglomeracion of a relatively large number so-called \"refugees\", their real number is far less Chan that being claimed by Pakistani and Western sources. The government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has announced a general amnesty decree for all Afghans living abroad and has reportedly called on them to return to their homelands and villages and resume their normal peaceful life. This call was positively responded to by a large number of them. The number of returnees would have been greater if certain artificial barriers and obstacles were not created by the counter-revolutionary armed bandits and the Pakistani authorities. -334- I hope that all these aids and assistance will be devoted to constructive and productive areas and not for other purposes. For example, in many areas we also have to devote these aids and funds and utilize them, such as for land reform programmes for the benefit of small and landless farmers and nomads; for the construction of more than 250 agricultural extension units up to the village level; for land improvements and for infrastructure in agriculture; for fisheries, forestries and pastures and other areas, aids. In spite of implemented-99. percent in wheat crops to the current year crop seasons in Afghanistan. However, due to the shortage of rainfall and due to the continuous droughts in North Afghanistan, about half a million hectares of arid and irrigated lands have been damaged and burned out. shortage of 390 000 tons of wheat has occurred in current years in food consumption, and the urgent attention of WFP for Afghanistan, as well as for other countries, in this regard. Likewise there are also many useful projects to draw every sort of aid and funds in these aspects. Malikana Mike LISWANISO (Zambia):We would prepared and presented document. My have paid tribute Mr Ingram on his reappointment for another five-year term of office. We wish him well. My country is a beneficiary of WFP aid, which aid has gone a long way in supplementing our developmental efforts. in food aid projects. This is how it ought to be. Our womenfolk form the bulk of our population in rural areas. Maybe that is why we have very few ladies in our delegation to date. Coming as I do from southern Africa, a region where we are daily being destabilized by the racist regime of South Africa, I wish to register my country's appreciation to WFP for coming to the assistance of refugees and other displaced persons in our region. The WFP's timely assistance has been a great relief to us. In conclusion, I wish to refer to the concept of monetarization of projects. My delegation does not see anything controversal about this concept. I am not a member of the CFA, but I understand that this matter generated a lot of debate at the last meeting. It is the view of my delegation that the monetarization of projects Is, in fact, an Executive Director, Mr Salahuddin Amhed, on his work and the Report which reveals clarity of thought and expression. It also the of WFP's operations. It is also timely to refer here to the decision during the last CFA to strongly recommend the reappointment of Mr J. Ingram for a well-deserved second terra as Executive Director of WFP in the interest of continuity and in recognition of his good work, and his unobtrusive and effective leadership. We wish him well and with the humanitarian tasks in cooperation with FAO, other organizations and nations. The WFP has emerged as one of those international organizations whose role is recognized in encouraging and implementing on whole, an acceptable and wholesome of food surpluses, the developing countries, it is heartening to see how the developed countries continue to show their solidarity in the emphasis and the need to assist those more seriously affected, and, in recent years, a of African countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Even though there are food deficit countries In other parts of the world and countries whose income is as low in Asia or in Latin America as some of the adversely affected African countries, there has been continuing sympathy and solidarity with those African countries which have been given a priority over the last few years, not only in WFP's operations but also as a general focus of international interest and cooperation. It is clear that the African countries are determined to tackle the agriculture and food problems in a more determined and effective manner. We are happy that WFP has so greatly both in dealing with the emergency problems and in assisting in the development process. We are particularly happy at the interest shown in in dealing with the refugee problems which are arising in some of the frontline states in Southern Africa. However, I think it is desirable to refer to the increasing problems destabilization as a result of the -335- looming confrontation with South Africa and the likely consequences of further destabilization on frontline and other African states. It is here that WFP may need to anticipate, or at least respond quickly to the likely human and refugee problems that could arise. The experience of WFP in Ethiopia, its achievements in southern Sudan and elsewhere, give us hope that it will be in a position to deal with such problems if and as they develop. Coming to more general issues, we feel that to the extent possible there might be a little emphasis on non-cereal food items such as edible oils and other items, if there are such surpluses. The entire concept of monetization needs to be gone into because the basis of the WFP is really the food surpluses generated in a number of the countries of the world. If the food is not utilized as the medium of assistance and it is transferred into money, it be situation. It possible. to utilize triangular transactions is a very healthy one and I think in this Japan has played a very important role. The emphasis on small farmers, on the role of women, is very heartening and in keeping with the aims and objectives of WFP and we hope that this will continue. Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Es muy grato a mi delegaci\u00f3n intervenir en relaci\u00f3n con el tema 7 del orden del d\u00eda, Programa Mundial de Alimentos, y en especial a prop\u00f3sito del 11\u00b0 informe anual del Comit\u00e9 de Pol\u00edticas y Programas de Ayuda Alimentaria del PMA Naciones Unidas/FAO. Mi delegaci\u00f3n no tiene observaciones de fondo que formular en relaci\u00f3n con el informe presentado, que nos parece exhaustivo y que ha sido objeto de una presentaci\u00f3n clara y convincente del se\u00f1or Director Ejecutivo Adjunto, Se\u00f1or Ahmed. La labor del PMA debe ser encomiada y aplaudidos los resultados de la \u00faltima reuni\u00f3n del CPA en la cual donantes y beneficiarios demostraron sensatez y visi\u00f3n dignas de encomio. Es conveniente congratularse de la cooperaci\u00f3n y coordinaci\u00f3n cada vez m\u00e1s estrechas entre FAO y PMA y por la redesignaci\u00f3n del actual Director Ejecutivo, se\u00f1or Ingram, por un per\u00edodo adicional de cinco a\u00f1os. Igualmente espera mi delegaci\u00f3n la tendencia a la mayor universalidad en la acci\u00f3n del PMA, que adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 reestudiando su propia estructura interna para atender mejor las operaciones de campo. Mi delegaci\u00f3n invita a los amigos pa\u00edses donantes a considerar y valorar con serenidad el concepto de fondo del contravalor o de monetizaci\u00f3n en la ayuda del PMA atendiendo a la utilizaci\u00f3n del mecanismo por los mismos donantes de hoy, al concluir el \u00faltimo conflicto mundial, en ese momento, tanto en caracter de donantes como de beneficiarios Le complace a mi delegaci\u00f3n la declaraci\u00f3n que con relaci\u00f3n a esta materia ha formulado hoy la delegaci\u00f3n de Canad\u00e1, en el conocido franc\u00e9s de Quebec, en pro del sereno estudio de la cuesti\u00f3n que debe estar libre de prejucios, seg\u00fan lo dijo desde el comienzo mi delegaci\u00f3n. Esa declaraci\u00f3n ha sido seguida de otras, igualmente positivas, de parte de otros donantes, lo cual pone otra nota optimista respecto de la acci\u00f3n futura del PMA, y asimismo detectar consecuencias importantes en el traslado de un asunto desde la sala verde a la que cobija hoy nuestras labores. Finalmente encomia mi delegaci\u00f3n el reconocimiento y acci\u00f3n efectiva del PMA respecto de la funci\u00f3n de la mujer, seg\u00fan se expresa en las p\u00e1ginas 7 y 8 del informe.

Salahuddin AHMED (WFP): I must say that I myself, as well as my colleagues who are here, are extremely heartened by the very kind and very generous words of appreciation that have been voiced by the Council with regard to the Programme's activities and accomplishments. I would thank you heartily on behalf of the Executive Director for that. The Council has reiterated, what governments in the CFA and on previous occasions, its great: confidence and trust in the management and guidance of the Executive Director and I will faithfully convey this to him. You have been kind enough, Mr Chairman. Some of the delegates also referred to ray colleagues on the right, Mr Holder who is Acting Director of the Project Management Division and Mr Sintobin who is the Acting Director of the Resource Management Division. While I say \"Acting\" I must emphasize, and I am sure you are aware, that they are very active. Not only are they active, but as you have recognized yourselves, there are others at the Headquarters and in the field who are working actively to serve suffering humanity and to encourage development in the world. Thank you very much on their behalf and on behalf of myself for your very kind words. The delegate of Canada referred to a very apt approach. He mentioned a very critical and constructive approach to any analysis of the activities of the World Food Programme. We say that we heartily welcome that statement because it is very much consistent with, and in consonance with, our own approach from the management side, to be open and frank and to engage in constructively critical dialogue with the governments. Our thanks for that. There have been certain points raised. All of them I will not be able to cover but most of them I would like to address because I feel some of them need to be clarified a little further and others need to be explained on a little bit more. The delegate of the United Kingdom referred to the recent decision of the European Community in to allocation to conform to the development strategies of those countries. We are in regular touch, almost in daily touch, with the Community and its functionaries, and in December there w ill be further discussion with the Community with regard to how best we can make use of the Community's food aid contributions. So this is an area in which we are very deeply involved. In this connection, I would like also to put on record our very deep appreciation for the very generous contributions that we received not only for our Regular B udget but also during the African referred the \"project cycle\" concept as something which was promising. I may inform you that for CFA/23 which will take place in the Spring of next year, all the project documents which will be submitted for approval will reflect this new concept. That means we will see some changes in the format, and as has been known to the members here, this format tries to be more definitive, more refined, more sharply focused and more pointed with regard to the objectives, with regard to the utilization, with regard to the assessment, and with regard to the evaluation, and it tries also to cut down on the existing number of steps that we have in order finally to lead to project approval by the CFA. So this is something which you will see reflected in the next set of projects which will be submitted to the CFA in the Spring of next year. -337- One particular aspect of it has been referred to by the Ambassador of the PDRY when he said that there is a WFP mission currently visiting his country. This is part of for adapting and utilizing food aid more effectively within the national economic development strategy. Other missions will be going to shutan and Bolivia. This is with regard to the project cycle. Another point was mentioned regarding our handling of refugees. It is common knowledge that the WFP and UNHCR collaborate with each other very closely and almost on a daily basis, with regard to finding what we need for feeding and sheltering refugees. Feeding is our part. But at the same time we also look into a number of possibilities where we can help in the rehabilitation efforts of the refugees in the host countries. A number of these programmes are currently going on, for example in Angola for Namibian refugees, in Uganda for Rwanda refugees, in Botswana for refugees from Zimbab we, and also in the Sudan. This is to give an indication that where rehabilitation is possible, feasible, desirable and wanted by the host country, we try to help them along. With regard to our general approach, again, it was mentioned that emergencies should not be the main plank of the operation of the World Food Programme-development should be the real orientation. In my statement I mentioned this fact, and the Executive Director has mentioned it repeatedly, but where there is human suffering we have to rush in and try to eliminate suffering as far as food is involved. But our main concern even in times of emergency is to work for the prevention of emergencies, and even while going for feeding programmes, wherever it is feasible we try to encourage food-for-work projects so that emergency relief can be ensured and at the same time certain infrastructures can also be built for future development utilization. The delegate of Colombia referred to some matters, and we always listen to him with great respect. He mentioned regional allocation of resources. Members are aware that there is no national allocation of resources as such as between regions or as between countries. But the fact is that the particular share of a country or a region may vary from year to year depending on the type of projects, ongoing, expanded or freshly approved by the CFA. However, I am able to tell him and to inform this assembly that during this current year, the two sessions of the CFA, 21 and 22, approved projects in Latin America and Caribbean region wo rth $99 million and we fi nd that while ten percent of the share globally went to Latin America in 1985, in 1986 it is 17 percent of the total. As I said, these figures are variable and we have to look at the long-term trends and the long-term needs. All of you have heard the remark of the delegate of Zambia that no African project that was submitted to us in 1985 was rej ected by us, we tried to accommodate it. Similarly, in the case of Latin America we try to be as understanding as possible and to help wherever it Is feasible; this Is something that we will keep in view while looking at the overall balance throughout the world, depending on the need perceived. Triangular transactions are one thing that occupies our attention in the CFA and the Council and the Programme, and it occupies the attention of the Executive Director. Wherever it is possible we try to encourage triangular transactions. Again it depends; it may not always be showing the same trend. Our people have done an analysis of the trend during 1986, for example, and we hope that by the end of the year the purchases that we will have made as triangular tr ansactions will be at least at the level of 1984, wh ich is higher than the 80 percent that we achieved in 1985. We hope it will be possible to do so. Overall I must say that total purchases we have made are rising. In 1975 we purchased commodities worth about $58 million, but In 1986 it will go up to about $73 million and proportionately, as I have said, the triangular transactions will also rise. A point was made about the utilization of the vessels of the developing countries. The programme is always solicitous in this matter, but again it depends on the availability of the vessels and the costs structure-the CFA, the governing body, is always very keen to see that we handle our operations cost-effectively. But subject to that, over the last three years we have seen that steadily the utilization of the vessels of the developing countries in value terms has gone up from 10 to 11-12 percent and we will keep this concern very much in view. With regard to the geographical representation in the staffing structure of the WFP, this is a point that definitely engages the attention of the Member Governments, and of the Executive Director from session to session, month to month, year to year. But as you realize, Mr Chairman, we have a very small staff, something that we have been complimented on, and our total international staff, both at headquarter s and in the field, will not ex ceed 324. So we will have to depend on the opportunities and keep in view the overall competitive nature and in particular the requirements of particular posts. Subject to that, the points made by delegates will be kept in view and we will keep in touch with them and we hope that over time whatever points of dissatisfaction there are will be eliminated. I will definitely communicate the points of view to the Executive Director. Very legitimately something has been said about women-and we are very glad about it-not because a because the World Food Programme has viewed women as development partners, not just as a separate entity. We are a programme and as a programme we have our mandate and our procedures. But the fact remains that we are part of the human society and all the staff of the WFP share a common human heritage, and that is respect for women and our obligation to women as mothers, wives, sisters and daughters, and as I said a while ago, in our context, as development partners. There are different ways in which we try to tackle this problem of representation of women. In the staff, of course, it is going up, as the Ambassador of Colombia mentioned. In the beneficiaries of the WFP programmes, there are a number of ways that we can do it, and we are doing it, but of course it is not yet perfect and we have to do a lot more, we recognize that. For example, if there is a maternity and child welfare project women are the direct beneficiaries. Again, there are certain projects which are more suited to women's capabilities, for example in forestry projects-and portfolio-in the nurseries women find it more congenial to work. There are yet other areas, for example in Lesotho we have ongoing food-for-work programmes and there we find that about 90 percent of the workers are women. For one reason or another they like it and the work is available and they take it. In Bangladesh there are also projects where women form the bulk of the workforce. I must tell you more about the policy objectives in this area. I think you need to know this and I would like to inform you about it. As part of the project cycle exercise we have issued very elaborate guidelines to our field officers asking them to take care of the special representation of women, special utilization of a very elaborate discussion with UNICEF, following which the two executive heads issued joint instructions to the field staff to develop joint strategies, joint policies and joint programmes which enhance the participation of women in those projects. In mid-December we are going to have a meeting with the UNDP, UNICEF and UNFPA in order to coordinate our strategies, policies and working modalities so that together we can do more about women in development. So I have told you about some of the things that we are doing and some of the things we have in mind and the joint efforts that we are making in this direction. There are two other points that engaged the attention of the delegates. One was monetarization and the other was the management review that this Programme undertook. With regard to monetarization I the WFP approach to development projects, I would say that there was no \"conceived trend\" towards it this just happened. This is a point that the Executive Director stated very clearly and succinctly In CFA/22. In fact the projects concerned happened to have monetarization as part of a bigger project strategy in cooperation with other international agencies, including IDA and World Bank, for example, or as part of the overall development strategy of the country. Together these projects that went to the CFA did not constitute more than 9 per cent of the total project effo rt during 1986. However, it has been very clearly decided by the CFA that there will be a policy paper brought to its spring session on monetarization in all its aspects and the committee will give its very deep and constructive and critical thought to that, following which we shall know which way to proceed with regard to it. The Executive Director has looked at monetarization, in certain cases, as an integral and inescapable part of project implementation depending on the nature of the project and depending on the nature of the strategy into which it builds itself. As regards management review, again as with individuals so with nations and so with International organizations, there is a time to pause and ponder, to adapt, to reorientate, and that is something that one of the delegates mentioned here. We had a review and the CFA in the last session had a preview of that. We have had certain broad guidelines and certain ideas and we will keep all this in view as we pro ceed further with the review implementation. A point was also counterpart funds, and the utilization of the counterpart funds. I must say that as part of the project cycle concept we have also worked out detailed the management of in the closest consultation with the governments. These guidelines have been passed on to our field offices which will help them to be more specific, more circumspect and more helpful in their discussion made of the situation in South Sudan by the distinguished delegate of Tunisia. It is known that the did undertake airlifts of food; however, World Food Programme did undertake trucking of food from the south through Kenya, Uganda and even sometimes from Zaire. Food is moving into that area. I have information that only one day ago another consignment went into Juba. Another place, Wau, which has been starved of food for a while, there also, food has arrived only recently. Food also arrived at Malakal, about two thousand tonnes, -339- some two weeks ago. This is something that is going on. We have some trucks moving through Uganda and we hope that they will also be able to cross into Sudan. This is an area that is r eceiving the very, very constant attention of the World Food Programme and donor agencies including NGOs. The last point, one made by the distinguished Ambassador of India with regard to the situation in southern Africa and the particular problems of the front line states. I should say that we are very much in touch with the developments and with the countries over there. There was a meeting held only ten days ago in New York, by the Vice-President of Botswana who is Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the SADDC Countries. He met with the Secretary General of the UN to discuss the developing situation, or the possible developments, and how the United Nations system could respond to the problems of the front line countries. WFP was present there and we are liaising with them. We attended recently a meeting of the Beira Corridor Authority that was held in Brussels to find out how best we can help it. We are actively considering assisting the port and railway workers at Beira, and thereabouts. We are also engaged in discussions with Zimbabwe as to helping them in railway-related developments along the Beira Corridor. We are also expecting to have soon a list of the items which may be required of us as a contingency measure, in case the situation should deteriorate over there. phrase that attracted my attention very much was raised by the distinguished delegate of the USA. He mentioned about 'promissary note'. I can tell you this much, that we accept the praise of today as the promissary note of tomorrow. We hope to cash it some day, and cash it effectively. There was also mention of the resource position, and while members want to see the resources improved, they also wish to see very much that the resources are economically, effectively and efficiently invested. We are heartened by that. We hope that all the donors from developed and developing countries, from socialist countries, all of them will keep this in mind that the World Food Programme Is trying to do a job on their behalf, for them and for the poorer people of the world. Not only will there be need for fulfilment of regular pledges and other pledges but also for the cash resources which are vital for triangular transactions or other local purchases in developing countries. I hope all this will r eceive their due and urgent attention. Finally, Mr Chairman, it has been a pleasure to be with the Council under your very esteemed chairmanship and leadership. I must say that I enlightened, fortified and having greatly benefitted from appearance before this Committee. Thank you, Mr Chairman, and through you thanks to all the members of the Council.

Informe del 11\u00b0 per\u00edodo d e sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial (Roma, 9-16 abril de 1986 ) Guillermo Enrique GONZALEZ (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial): Se\u00f1or Presidente, distinguidos delegados y observadores: como Presidente del 11\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria tengo el honor de presentar a este Consejo el informe aprobado en esta oportunidad y que apar ece como documento CL 90/10 -343- El Comit\u00e9 celebro su 11 \u00b0 Operiodo de sesiones en esca misma sala del 9 al 16 de abril de 1986. Los importantes temas de la agenda fueron analizados, y esco deseo subrayarlo, con el mejor esp\u00edritu de cooperaci\u00f3n y respeto, hecho que por ciertofacilit\u00f3 las labores de la Presidencia. El primer tema de sustancia que se trat\u00f3 fue el relativo a la evaluaci\u00f3n de la situaci\u00f3n de la seguridad alimentaria mundial, tanto en el corto como en ci mediano plazo. El Comit\u00e9 mostr\u00f3 particular preocupaci\u00f3n por las actuales limitaciones al comercio international, as\u00ed como por las dificultades econ\u00f3micas y financieras que afectan a toda la comunidad international. Aunque los precios de ios cereales han ca\u00eddo a m\u00ednimos hist\u00f3ricos muchos pa\u00edses en desarrollo no pudieron beneficiarse plenamente de esos bajos precios debido a la falca de moneda convertible como consecuencia de la declinaci\u00f3n de los precios de sus propios produceos de exportaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como de la pesada carga de la deuda excerna y los servicios de la deuda externa, las alcas Casas de \u00ednteres, y en algunos casos, as\u00ed fue se\u00f1alado por algunas delegaciones, por una disminuci\u00f3n de la asistencia externa. Respecto al comercio, el Comit\u00e9 convino en que para facilitar el a cceso de los pa\u00edses en desarrollo a las importaciones de alimentos era indispensable mejorar el clima econ\u00f3mico y comercial interna-cional. El Comit\u00e9 recomend\u00f3 que todos los pa\u00edses examinaran las medidas n ecesarias para mejorar ese c lima, a fin de favorecer la contribuci\u00f3n del comercio en el fortalec imiento de la seguridad alimentaria mundial. El Comit\u00e9 expres\u00f3 su satisfacci\u00f3n porque por segundo a\u00f1o consecutivo se hab\u00edan sobrepasado los 10 millones de toneladas de ayuda alimentaria, as\u00ed como por la extensi\u00f3n por otros tres a\u00f1os del Convenio de Ayuda Alimentaria. El Comit\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n tom\u00f3 nota con satisfacci\u00f3n de que varios pa\u00edses donantes y el PMA hab\u00edan recurrido con mayor frecuencia a las transacciones triangulares para el suministro de la ayuda alimentaria, y se subray\u00f3 la funci\u00f3n positiva que desempe\u00f1aban tales transacciones al utilizar excedentes de pa\u00edses en desarrollo y facilitar la entrega en tiempo de los suministros en zonas deficitarias. Se se\u00f1al\u00f3 asimismo que el objetivo \u00faltimo de la seguridad alimentaria en el plano mundial deb\u00eda ser el de asegurar el acceso material y econ\u00f3mico a los a limentos b\u00e1sicos para la subsistencia. En este sentido se subray\u00f3 que la pobreza constituye el mayor impedimento de la seguridad alimentaria en gran n\u00famero de pa\u00edses en desarrollo donde el insuficiente acceso a los a limentos se debe fundamentalmente a la falca de poder adquisitivo. Sobre la base de la evaluaci\u00f3n realizada, el Comit\u00e9 consider\u00f3 que adem\u00e1s de las medidas para liberalizar el comercio se necesitaba fortalecer tambi\u00e9n las \u00e1reas de producci\u00f3n, investigaci\u00f3n, reservas y acceso aios a limentos. El Comit\u00e9 puntualiz\u00f3 que para alcanzar la seguridad alimentaria nacional se deb\u00eda incrementar la producci\u00f3n y la productividad alimentaria. Se se\u00f1al\u00f3 que las buenas cosechas de este a\u00f1o podr\u00edan proporcionar quiz\u00e1s la oportunidad para invertir en programas de recuperaci\u00f3n y rehabilitaci\u00f3n a mediano plazo. En lo que hace a las medidas tomadas en relaci\u00f3n con elinforme del Director General sobrela Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial, el Comit\u00e9 consider\u00f3 los siguientes cuatro temas: a) perspectivas alimentarias a plazo medio y seguridad alimentaria mundial; b) la funci\u00f3n de las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y pl\u00e1canos en la seguridad alimentaria de Africa Subsahariana; c) el dep\u00f3sito preventivo de existencias de alimentos para acelerar las entregas de ayuda alimentaria en casos de urgencia, y d) la planificaci\u00f3n de un buen estado de preparaci\u00f3n nacional para hacer frente a las situaciones alimentarias de urgencia. -344- Con respecto al primero, el Comit\u00e9 consider\u00f3 que Las prev isiones preparadas por la FAO para 1990 constitu\u00edan una advertencia oportuna paralos gobiernos y paraLa Comunidad Internacional. El Comit\u00e9 se felicit\u00f3 de Las mejoras introducidas por La FAO al elaborar sus proyecciones sobre La base del modelo a limentario mundial, que permit\u00eda decerminar en forma simult\u00e1nea La oferta, La demanda, el comercio y Los precios en el sistema de cereales, se millas oleaginosas, ganader\u00eda y hacer extensivas las proyecciones a Las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y leguminosas. Se observ\u00f3 que si bien se preve\u00eda que hasta 1990 la producci\u00f3n mundiaL de cereales ser\u00eda cuantiosa, eL suministro per capita de alimentos b\u00e1sicos en Los pa\u00edses en desarrollo, s\u00f3Lo cr ecer\u00eda en forma marginal. El Comit\u00e9 se\u00f1al\u00f3 con preocupaci\u00f3n que en La eventualidad de una p\u00e9rdida generalizada de cosechas, las perspectivas desfavorables paraIn seguridad alimentaria de muchos pa\u00edses en desarrollo empeora-r\u00edan notablemente porque pese a Las cuantiosas existencias a niveL global sus efectos se distribuir\u00edan de manera desigual, mientras que en Los pa\u00edses industrializados una p\u00e9rdida generalizada de cosechas implicar\u00eda una disminuci\u00f3n del uso de cereales como piensos, en el Tercer Mundo, una situaci\u00f3n tal se traducir\u00eda en una sensible disminuci\u00f3n deL consumo alimentario. Es interesante destacar que Las proyecciones indicaron la posib ilidad de una ampliaci\u00f3n del comercio enere pa\u00edses en desarrollo, particularmente en el arroz, Leguminosas, aceites vegetales y deLos llamados cereales secundarios. El Comit\u00e9 examin\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n La funci\u00f3n de las ra\u00edces. Los tub\u00e9rculos y los pl\u00e1tanos en la seguridad alimentaria del Africa Subsahariana y subray\u00f3 La importante funci\u00f3n de \u00e9stos y otros alimentos b\u00e1-sicos tradicionales en los modelos de producci\u00f3n y consumo, no solamente en Africa sino tambi\u00e9n enotras regiones. As\u00ed se solicit\u00f3 a la FAO que realizara estudios concretos sobre las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y pl\u00e1tanos en Am\u00e9rica Latina y eL Caribe. Se reconoci\u00f3, por otra parte, las diversas dificultades que imped\u00edan el desarrollo de las ra\u00edces y los pl\u00e1tanos en el Africa Subsahariana. En este contexto se recomend\u00f3 dar prioridad a las pol\u00edticas de aliento de producci\u00f3n y de consumo. En Lo que hace a la pol\u00edtica de precios, se sugiri\u00f3 tener encuenta su relaci\u00f3n con los de los cereales scan nacionales como importados, con el objeto de ir reduciendo La dependencia externa. Advirtiendo el roL dela mujer en estos cultivos, el Comit\u00e9 solicit\u00f3 se adoptaran medidas concretas en Los sectores de la capacitaci\u00f3n, el acceso al cr\u00e9dito y a la tierra, as\u00ed como otras formas de apoyo oficial en favor de la mujer. El Comit\u00e9 examin\u00f3 La propuesta relativa al dep\u00f3sito preventivo de existencias de alimentos, con antelaci\u00f3n a las situaciones de urgencia. Se coincidi\u00f3 en la necesidad de reducir Las demoras en la entrega de ayuda de emergencia y as\u00ed se recalc\u00f3 que podr\u00edan introducirse mejoras en todas las etapas del proceso de respuesta y que la propuesta sobre el dep\u00f3sito preventivo de existencias deb\u00eda examinarse en un marco m\u00e1s amplio. Es mi deber se\u00f1alar que algunas delegaciones expresaron que tal evaluaci\u00f3n deb\u00eda realizarse teniendo en cuenta la relaci\u00f3n, costo-beneficio, en comparaci\u00f3n con otras alternativas. Muchos otros delegados en cambio hicieron hincapi\u00e9 en que taL relaci\u00f3n no era apropiada pues los beneficios finales no pod\u00edan cuantificarse. El Comit\u00e9 solicit\u00f3 finalmente a La Secretar\u00eda un nuevo estudio de Las experiencias recientes, con objeto de cuantificar, con mayor precisi\u00f3n, el tiempo que se empleaba en las distintas fases del proceso de respuesta as\u00ed como de los beneficios que podr\u00edan obtenerse con el dep\u00f3sito preventivo de existencias. El nuevo estudio comprend\u00eda tambi\u00e9n el an\u00e1lisis delos procedimientos administrativos deLos donantes para La entrega de la ayuda de emergencia. La Secretar\u00eda me ha informado que esta parte del estudio ya se encuentra en preparaci\u00f3n y que ser\u00e1 presentada ai Comit\u00e9 en su d\u00e9cimo segundo per\u00edodo de sesiones en abriL de 1987. EL Comit\u00e9 examin\u00f3 el documento sobre la licitaci\u00f3n de un buen estado de preparaci\u00f3n nacional para hacer frente a situaciones alimentarias de emergencia o de urgencia. EL mismo cenia en cuencalos resultados y conclusiones de tres cursillos pr\u00e1cticos sobre el tema, organizados Los tres por La FAO. El Comit\u00e9 estim\u00f3 que el documento ofrec\u00eda un marco \u00fatil para establ ecer planes nacionales en este sentido. Tales planes no deb\u00edan formar parte integrante, perd\u00f3n, tales planes deb\u00edan formar parte integrante de Los programas de seguridad alimentaria a largo plazo. -345- Se reconoci\u00f3 que los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos con deficit de alimentos tropezaban con diversos obst\u00e1culos para hacer frente a las situaciones de urgencia y que se necesitar\u00eda La asistencia t\u00e9cnica y financiera para establecer y reforzar los programas nacionales para un buen estado de preparaci\u00f3n. Por otra parte, el Comit\u00e9 acogi\u00f3 con satisfacci\u00f3n el rol de la FAO en el mejoramiento de los sistemas nacionales de informaci\u00f3n y alerta y en otros aspectos pertinentes de la licitaci\u00f3n de la preparaci\u00f3n en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo y solicit\u00f3 que la Secretar\u00eda siguiera de cerca los progresos que se realicen en este campo e informe oportunamente al Comit\u00e9. Por \u00faltimo, y me excuso Sr. Presidente por haber tomado tanto tiempo, el Comit\u00e9 examin\u00f3 por quinta vez las actividades del Plan de Asistencia para la Seguridad Alimentaria (PASA) y reiter\u00f3 su apoyo general a la labor de campo realizada por la FAO en el marco del Plan. El Comit\u00e9 subray\u00f3 que las actividades del PASA deb\u00edan formar parte integrante del marco m\u00e1s alto de asistencia para el fomento de la seguridad alimentaria proporcionada a trav\u00e9sde organizaciones bilaterales y multilaterales y en este contexto se se\u00f1al\u00f3 la necesidad de coordinar mejor las actividades de la FAO con los donantes, en particular a nivel de pa\u00edses beneficiarios. Manifest\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n su apoyo a las prioridades que en el marco del Pian est\u00e1 otorgando a los pa\u00edses en desarrollo interesados en la elaboraci\u00f3n de planes nacionales para enfrentar situaciones de emergencia alimentaria y respald\u00f3 las sugerencias presentadas en el documento de Secretar\u00eda sobre las orientaciones del Plan durante el pr\u00f3ximo bienio. Me excuso nuevamente por haber tomado tanto tiempo. Creo que no se me han pasado ninguno de los principales puntos analizados en el Comit\u00e9 durante el 11 \u00b0 periodo de sesiones. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie M. Gonzalez, Pr\u00e9sident du temps. Jorge Ra\u00fal BUSTAMANTE ROLDAN (Colombia): La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia considera que el 11\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria, fue muy productivo bajo la din\u00e1mica e inteligente presidencia de su colega y amigo, Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez, cuya presentaci\u00f3n del tema ha sido excelente. Este Consejo debe lamentar, que, como lo indican los p\u00e1rrafos 10 y 11 del documento CL 90/10, no obstante un aumento sustancial de la producci\u00f3n mundial de alimentos b\u00e1sicos y una parcial recuperaci\u00f3n en Africa, persiste a\u00fan el hambre y la malnutrici\u00f3n en esos pa\u00edses. Pero m\u00e1s preocupante a\u00fan para este Consejo debe ser lo afirmado en el p\u00e1rrafo 11: \"el estado nutri-cional de la poblaci\u00f3n pobre, tanto en las zonas urbanas, como rurales, estaba empeorando seriamente en muchos pa\u00edses, sobre todo en Am\u00e9rica Latina\". Con esta preocupaci\u00f3n en mente, en la pasada Conferencia Regional de la FAO para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, los Gobiernos de nuestra regi\u00f3n pidieron al Director General que elaborara un estudio sobre el desarrollo a largo plazo de nuestra regi\u00f3n en los campos de la Agricultura y la Alimentaci\u00f3n. Estamos seguros que el Director General ha iniciado ya los preparativos para realizar ese estudio a la mayor brevedad posible, en t\u00e9rminos pragm\u00e1ticos, y en estrecha cooperaci\u00f3n con los organismos regionales y subregionales, para evitar duplicaci\u00f3n de actividades. En este contexto, se habla tambi\u00e9n de la convocatoria de una consulta de expertos para acrecentar el acceso de los sectores pobres de la poblaci\u00f3n a los a limentos. Desear\u00edamos saber se\u00f1or Presidente, cu\u00e1ndo se va a realizar esa consulta y si ya se pueden adelantar algunas informaciones al respecto. El Gobierno de Colombia concede gran importancia a la seguridad alimentaria. -346- Hemos decidido dedicar Los mayores esfuerzos al fortalecimiento del sector agropecuario para procurar un incremento sustancial de La producci\u00f3n de alimentos, Lo cual garantizar\u00e1 el normal abastecimiento de los mismos a Las grandes ciudades, favoreciendo las demandas de Los sectores urbanos mayoritaria-mente pobres y asegurando la seguridad alimentaria, sobre todo a los grupos m\u00e1s vulnerables de la poblaci\u00f2n. Esa estrategia, dirigida por el Ministerio de Agricultura de Colombia, forma parte de un gran programa integral, cuyo componente principal es el apoyo a los peque\u00f1os y medianos productores campesinos, quienes tendr\u00e1n acceso a l\u00edneas de cr\u00e9dito para la producci\u00f3n, el mercadeo y la organizaci\u00f3n de grupos comercializadores, complementariamente con proyectos gubernamentales de inversi\u00f3n, en obras de infraestructura: v\u00edas, acueductos, peque\u00f1os distritos de riego, electrificaci\u00f3n, vivienda rural, centros de salud, escuelas, centros de acopio, de recreaci\u00f3n y cultura. Asimismo, se orientar\u00e1n programas de inversi\u00f3n para prestar asesor\u00eda y capacitaci\u00f3n en la transferencia y aplicaci\u00f3n de nuevas tecnolog\u00edas productivas, maquinaria moderna apta para la producci\u00f3n campesina y todas las demandas alternativas que viabilicen el mejoramiento general de las condiciones econ\u00f3micas y sociales de los campesinos colombianos. Todo ello dirigido al fortalecimiento de la seguridad alimentaria en nuestro pa\u00eds. El Minister. iode Agricultura se ha consolidado como el instrumento que dirige la totalidad de la pol\u00edtica agropecuaria y ha recibido del gobierno el m\u00e1ximo apoyo para convertirse en el organismo l\u00edder de los grandes programas sociales que son una meta del gobierno del Presidente Virgilio Barco. Dichos programas proponen combatir las situaciones depobreza absoluta que padecen millones de colombianos, habitantes de las zonas marginales de la ciudad y el campo. En su reciente discurso ante la Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas expres\u00f3 el Presidente Virgilio Barco que, \"En Colombia, a pesar de los esfuerzos realizados en favor del desarrollo y el bienestar de la poblaci\u00f3n, enfrentamos en el presente una realidad dram\u00e1tica en relaci\u00f3n con la pobreza. El 25 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n, o sea 6 millones y medio de personas, se encuentran en una situaci\u00f3n de pobreza absoluta. El desempleo abierto y el subempieo afectan a m\u00e1s de un tercio de la poblaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3micamente activa\". Ante esas circunstancias, el gobierno colombiano ha adoptado medidas urgentes:Ha enviado a las C\u00e1maras Legislativas proyectos de ley que faciliten poner en marcha, con eficacia y prontitud, reformas en las estructuras de la econom\u00eda agraria yurbana; ha ordenado acciones inmediatas en programas de agua potable, vivienda, salud y nutrici\u00f3n y se prepara para ejecutar un plan de empleo de emergencia. La Reforma Agraria en Colombia est\u00e1 concebida no solamente como un plan de redistribuci\u00f3n de tierras, sino tambi\u00e9n como un programa de desarrollo integral y de seguridad alimentaria. Esto es, con las inversiones n ecesarias en infraestructura, en cr\u00e9dito y en transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda. Es tambi\u00e9n decisi\u00f3n del actual gobierno colombiano, orientar los recursos p\u00fablicos y el cr\u00e9dito internacional hacia la inversi\u00f3n social, en programas capaces de generar bienestar colectivo y una distribuci\u00f3n m\u00e1s equitativa de la riqueza nacional. El Presidente Barco en los diversos foros internacionales ha formulado un llamado a Los pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina y del mundo entero para concertar una acci\u00f3n solidaria contra la pobreza absoluta. Colombia est\u00e1 auspiciando una reuni\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses de la regi\u00f3n, de los industrializados y de aquellos en v\u00eda de desarrollo, que quieran hacer propuestas e intercambiar experiencias \u00fatiles en La gran batalla de la civilizaci\u00f3n contra ese degradante flagelo social. Colombia ha recibido de la FAO, desde hace muchos a\u00f1os, su apoyo invaluable, conjuntamente con otros organismos de las Naciones Unidas. La FAO ha facilitado recursos financieros y experiencia t\u00e9cnica para dise\u00f1ar y poner en funcionamiento sistemas de informaci\u00f3n y de planificaci\u00f3n regional esenciales para lograr la modernizaci\u00f3n del sector agropecuario y un mejor aprovechamiento de nuestras posibilidades productivas. -347- De igual manera, traba jamos con la FAO en la aplicaci\u00f3n de opciones diversas para explotar recurso que, como Los de la pesca, tienen en Colombia un enorme potencial y significan soluciones reales a Los problemas de La desnutrici\u00f3n y La alimentaci\u00f3n, en busca de La seguridad alimentaria. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia reconoce que-taL vez para compensar Los efectos nocivos de su pol\u00edtica prot eccionista- La Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea est\u00e1 financiando estudios sobre seguridad alimenta en el marco deLa Junta del Acuerdo de Cartagena (JUNAC). Son simplemente estudios los que auspicia la CEE. Ojal\u00e1 que La FAO coayudaraesa iniciativa para hacerla realmente eficaz. Pero sigamos analizando el documento que nos ocupa. Quiz\u00e1 Lo m\u00e1s preocupante es Lo planteado en el p\u00e1rrafo 14. El dif\u00edcil dilema en que han sido colocados los pa\u00edses en desarrollo, v\u00edctimas de pol\u00edticas prot eccionistas por parte de los pa\u00edses desarrollados en medio de una compleja debilidad de La demanda mundial de alimentos y de una inmensa deuda externa que nos agobia: muchos de nuestr Estados tienen que sacrificar su crecimiento econ\u00f3mico, estanc\u00e1ndose, porque las pocas divisas que obtienen, en un comercio internacional oprimido por las barreras, tienen que dedicarlas al servici de la deuda y no est\u00e1n en condiciones de importar alimentos, no obstante que Los precios de Los cereales hayan bajado. En este contexto, la deuda externa en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo y particularmente en Am\u00e9rica Latina es comparable a una larga sequ\u00eda que no sabemos cu\u00e1nto va a durar. As\u00ed pues, no se trata solamente de apuntalar los programas de cooperaci\u00f3n , sino de encontrar soluciones s\u00f3lidas y duraderas. Finalmente, reiterando el llamado del Presidente Barco, en el foro mundial: \"Nos corresponde mirar hacia adelante. Estamos tan solo a menos de 14 a\u00f1os del tercer milenio de nuestra era. La guerra y la paz, el desarrollo, ios derechos humanos, son asuntos que deben discutirse internacionaimente paralograr, por la v\u00eda de la negociaci\u00f3n, los compromisos eficaces que nos permitan avanzar\". \"Los pobres, los desempleados. , los discriminados, los campesinos que no pueden producir Lo que n ecesitan lo's ni\u00f1os, que mueren diaramente de hambre y de enfermedades que podr\u00edan ser curadas sin mayor esfuerzo. Son desigualdades, cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s intolerables en un planeta que tiene-esa es la verdad-la capacidad de superarlas\". Solitariamente no existen salidas para tan graves situaciones. Solidariamente podemos construir un mundo mejor... existen los medios; existe la tecnolog\u00eda. Nos falta el prop\u00f3sito. Nos falta la dec is ion. La esperanza debe inspirar otra vez, con toda su fuerza, las acciones de la sociedad internacional Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): la delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico se une a Las expresiones de ree cimiento y de agradecimiento al Presidente del C. S. A. , Ministro Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez, y le feLicita por la clara y comprensiva introducci\u00f3n al tema. La delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico coincide con el informe al se\u00f1alar nuestra preocupaci\u00f3n por el hecho de que las pol\u00edticas de los principales pa\u00edses exportadores de cereales contribuyen a reducir a\u00fan m\u00e1s los mercados y los precios mundiales de esos productos. Si bien se prev\u00e9 que para 1990 la producci\u00f3n mundial de cereales aumentar\u00e1 m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente que la demanda, el suministro per c\u00e1pita de alimentos en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo aumentar\u00e1 s\u00f3lo marginalmente en vista de que la producci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 inferior a la demanda y los ingresos ir\u00e1n a la zaga del ritmo de crecimiento de los a\u00f1os 70. Para hacer frente a una menor seguridad alimentaria, la comunidad internacional debeincrementar sustancialmente su asistencia y el otorgamiento de insumos. Coincidimos en ese sentido, comose expresa en el informe, en que las operaciones triangulares deben potenciarse y en que la necesidad de que la ayuda a limentaria sea oportuna y que se ligue a la pol\u00edtica de desarrollo es un imperativo. -348- La delegaci\u00f3n mexicana reitera la importancia de enriquecer el concepto ampliado de seguridad a limentaria con un reconocimiento expl\u00edcito del papel determinante que juegan ios insumos agr\u00edcolas, tales como los fertilizantes, plaguicidas, semillas, maquinaria, cr\u00e9dito, etc. Por otro lado subrayamos la necesidad de que ios pa\u00edses desarrollados adopten las medidas necesarias para revertir los factores adversos que menoscaban Los mecanismos del comercio internacionalde productos agroalimentarios, tales como el proteccionismo, Las restricciones ai cree imienco de Los mercados internacionales de productos b\u00e1sicos, la inestabilidad monetaria, Las oscilaciones de Los tipos de cambio y el elevado servicio de La deuda. En el examen del crecimiento de La producci\u00f3n y de Las reservas internacionales de alimentos, deben incorporarse dos elementos fundamentales, a saber: primero, La desregularizaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola de Los pa\u00edses desarrollados y la manipulaci\u00f3n de los precios internacionales de Los productos b\u00e1sicos que afecta principalmente a Los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. \u00a31 primer elemento favorece la aceleraci\u00f3n del proceso de concentraci\u00f3n monop\u00f3iico de La producci\u00f3n en Los pa\u00edses desarrollados, que llevar\u00e1 a reducir excedentes y a incrementar los precios a mediano plazo. EL segundo, est\u00e1 provocando el abandono de la producci\u00f3n en Los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. EL resultado de estos dos factores es por tanto una mayor dependencia y subordinaci\u00f3n alimentaria de Los pa\u00edses en desarroLLo. Subrayamos La funci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica, social y cultural de las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y pl\u00e1tanos, as\u00ed como de los llamados cereales secundarios en la seguridad alimentaria en el Tercer Mundo. En este sentido apoyamos plenamente las medidas recomendadas por el Comit\u00e9 para el Africa Subsahariana, para darles prioridad en el est\u00edmulo de la producci\u00f3n y en el consumo rural y urbano. El Africa Subsahariana nos merece el reconoc imiento de prioridad indiscutible. Por otra parte, como es del conocimiento de este Comit\u00e9 la regi\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, pidi\u00f3 al Director General en la 19 \u00b0 Conferencia Regional en Barbados, la realizaci\u00f3n de un estudio y plan de acci\u00f3n sobre el sector agr\u00edcola y alimentario en nuestra regi\u00f3n. Mi delegaci\u00f3n subraya que abrigamos importantes esperanzas de tal estudio, en tanto no sea un mero an\u00e1lisis monogr\u00e1fico de situaciones y problemas que todos conocemos, sino que se concentren en las tendencias y sobre todo acciones y expectativas en el mediano plazo, es decir, 5 a LO a\u00f1os. Que ese estudio nos permita dise\u00f1ar mejor nuestra estrategia de producci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n, los cauces de la cooperaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y t\u00e9cnica entre nuestros pa\u00edses y sobre todo que estimule a La comunidad internacional a responder a ios imperativos de asistencia, ayuda y finaneiamiento en nuestra regi\u00f3n. La parte medular del estudio la representa desde nuestro punto de vista, el plan de acci\u00f3n dela FAO hacia nuestra regi\u00f3n, es decir, lo que nuestra organizaci\u00f3n puede hacer a fin de contribuir a consolidar una estrategia de seguridad alimentaria, y que responda tambi\u00e9n a Las caracteristicas yn ecesidades de Los peque\u00f1os y medianos productores agr\u00edcolas y grupos marginados y zonas deprimidas tanto rurales como urbanas. Debe, por tanto, evaluarse la importancia de los cultivos tradicionales de producci\u00f3n local enel sector de subsistencia y su transcendencia econ\u00f3mica y nutricional en el contexto de las disponibilidades nacionales de alimentos. Asimismo, debe cuidarse el dise\u00f1o de t\u00e9cnicas deelaboraci\u00f3n apropiadas para obtener, de los cultivos secundarios, los alimentos convenientes para el consumo urbano, que se ajusten a los gustos y preferencias locales, con miras a limitar importaciones y a producir lo que con mayor rendimiento se da en las diversas subregiones. En este contexto es importante que el estudio reconozca el papel prioritario que los llamados cereales secundarios, as\u00ed como las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y frutos en general tienen en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe y que por ello merecen un tratamiento especial. De ah\u00ed que los programas de investigaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola, producci\u00f3n y aplicaci\u00f3n de variedades de plantas y sus respectivos paquetes tecnol\u00f3gicos, as\u00ed como la capacitaci\u00f3n y transferencia tecnol\u00f3gica, deban dise\u00f1arse atendiendo a las prioridades y caracter\u00edsticas antes se\u00f1aladas cuidando que no generen dependencia de ninguna especie. -349- Finalmente, tocante al estudio sobre la posibilidad de establ ecerdep\u00f3sitospreventivos de existencia de a limentos, que se realizar\u00e1 de acuerdo a las recomendaciones del Comit\u00e9, pensamos que debe abarcar a todas las regiones, inclusive la de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. E. Vernon WADE-BROWN (United Kingdom): I should like to begin by thanking Mr Gonzales for his excellent introduction. The report of the 11th Session of the Committee on World rood Security adequately reflects the harmonious and of important issues. Because of this my intervention on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom will be fairly brief. Paragraph 15 refers to a study on prospects for and constraints to the expansion of trade in agricultural products among developing countries. We would be very progress made so far and whether it is envisaged that the findings wiLL be presented at the 12th Session of the Committee on World Food Security next April. We retain reservations on the recommendation made in paragraph 23. In our view primary consideration must be given to the adoption of sound policies and the creation of effective markets. In our experience heavy investment in infrastructure with high recurrent costs in low-income countries has triangular transactions where such transactions can be seen to be cost-effective. We have this year purchased maize from Zimbabwe to meet emergency needs in neighbouring with the assistance of encourage Session we voiced unreserved support for the excellent document on roots, tubers and plantains. We support the observations and conclusions contained in the report. We would like to stress the importance of mobilizing extension services as a means to reduce losses due to pests and disease. It is important that farmers are aware of the importance of planting disease-free stock. The paper correctly points out that any extension effort should be directed at women farmers. At the reached without fully considering We agree that of effectiveness is inappropriate an emergency situation expeditious delivery of food supplies is the in order to alleviate human suffering and avoid loss of life. We, like most other donor countries, have the machinery to respond very quickly in a real emergency, and when we talk about cost-effectiveness we do so in terms of the formulation of a long-term strategy to cope with emergency situations. We have responded to requests for information in connection with the analysis mentioned in paragraph 51, and we will be interested to learn the results at the 12th Session in April next year. We welcome the conclusions and recommendations contained in the sections of the report covering national preparedness plans and the Food Security Assistance Scheme. Finally, we hope that FAO initiatives countries on how to pass the responsibility for food security to donors. We also hope that FAO will fully take into account the necessity to plus grande attention le rapport de la ll\u00e8me session du CSA. Nous heureux de constater que conformement aux nouveaux concepts de la SAM. Pour ce qui est de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire a court terme, ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation fait siennes les consign\u00e9es dans le rapport qui indiquent que la consommation des denr\u00e9es alimentaires de base par pays d\u00e9veloppement importer c\u00e9r\u00e9aLes dont ils ont yeux une autre source de paiements pays en continue \u00e0 se \u00e0 l'exportation, ce qui alourdit Le poids de la dette et du service de la dette, et dans plusieurs cas la chute de la demande des importations, la chute continue des prix \u00e0 les dont, d\u00e9veloppement.

Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): The World Food Security Committee's discussions on world food are an important contribution to world food security and are highly appreciated by my Government. We particularly welcome the account of the at the eleventh CFS session which is clearly reflected in the document We the discussion, as spelled out in paragraphs 8 to 11 of the document before us. As regards paragraph 12, 1 would, however, like to point out that the official development cooperation of my country has not been declining this year compared to the preceding year, but on the contrary has been increasing. The rate of growth of this item of theFederal Budget is even ex ceeding the average rate of growth of the overall national b udget of 1986. During the last few years we have always advocated a further liberalization of world trade. Therefore, we largely share the statements in paragraph 14 of the document and welcome the declaration on the negotiating mandate of GATT recently adopted in Punta del Este. The statements in which the discussions have led at the eleventh session of the World Food Council in Paris in June 1985. We share the statements in paragraphs 15 to 25 of the document. The expansion of cooperation among developing opinion ofparticular importance. therefrom. Triangular transactions (as mentioned in paragraphs 18 to 24) are also gaining momentum in the food aid provided by the European Community in which we have a share of 28 percent. We consider thestatements in paragraph 25 of the document particularly positive. We welcome the statements in paragraphs 35 to 42 of the document before us. In our view, a greater consideration of roots, tubers and plantains in the diet is also a practicable way of strengthening world food security. -352- As regards the question of prepositioning food stocks to expedite delivery of food aid, my delegation shares the view stated in paragraph 51 of the document that this complex of questions still needs further analysis. In this connection let me point out that the food stocks that we have meet the criteria of prepositioning as described in the documents of In country maintain several warehouses where stocks are be withdrawn for the purpose of foodaid, and quite a number of the warehouses are in the proximity of sea ports. We normally avail ourselves of the ports of Hamburg and Antwerp. We particularly welcome the proposed strictly voluntary character of such measures of prepositioning. As regards national preparedness planning to cope with food we particularly share should with a general remark that the Committee's yearly assessment of the World Food situation been very useful forus, especially following the adoption of the broadened conceptof Food Security a few years ago. We gladly noticed that the eleventh session of the Committee was a su ccessful one in respect of its observations, conclusions and recommendations on very important issues. Therefore, we are glad to say that we fully support all these conclusions and recommendations. Having offered our general support for the report I now wish to make some specific remarks. Turning to the report, one may firstly observe with regret that in the course of one year which elapsed since the tenth session of the Committee the World Food Security situation had not fundamentally improved. It may also with caution, certain developments have occurred in the right direction, such as global recovery of food production inAfrica and the attainment of record crops in a developing other regions. Indeed, it notice, draws to these that such developments did lead to an improvement of the food security situation in these countries, for various reasons. First of all, the external environment did, and still does, hamper the efforts of developing countries aiming at the improvement of the food security situation. In this connection, in particular, I should like to mention the adverse effects of the decline in trade earnings from agricultural on the food security situation their achievements developing commodity trade some It is repeatedly said by my delegation, as well other delegations, that trade plays a determining role in the world food supply and demand system and consequently in the role of food security. Therefore we do not find it surprising to see the adverse effects of the trade environment for the export developing countries burdens their additional food requirements by means of imports. In the light of this we fully share the concern expressed by the majority of delegates over the worsening international economic and trading environment and its consequences on world food security. I also wish to state that we fully endorse the recommendation of the Committee in paragraph food security situation in some developing countries I wish to point to the declining level of governments'social assistance programmes to the poor and the resulting deterioration in the a ccessability to food by this group of people. With this in mind, we hope that the committee will be given an opportunity at a future session to study the role played by the declining level of support to the poor and the persistent widespread hunger and malnutrition to expeditedeliveryof emergency food aid, we share the view that in addition co its contribution to reducing the delivery period at the time of the food emergencies, it can also facilitate the handling at the avoiding possible congestion. Taking into account the consequences on of delays in food deliveries and the insignificant level of cost involved in the food prepositioning operations, my delegation encourages FAO to undertake a more detailed study referred to in paragraph 51 on this subject in order to compare the cost effectiveness of prepositioning stocks with that arrangements that the donor governments are presently making in this regard. We hope this comparative study will provide us with a broad framework within which all delegates can see and appreciate the relative usefulness and cost effectiveness of food repos itioning. Lastly, I should like to take up the section of the report relating to national preparedness planning to respond to food view that national preparedness plans, when formulated as an integral part of overall food security programmes, will enable governments better to cope with food also agree which the observation country Let me now emphasize fact that in view of the complexity of formulating and implementing these country specific plans we believe that the training of people to assume responsibilities on this exercise should be given great importance attention by FAO and other organizations. In this context, I particularly wish to mention the need for training arrangements on a regional basis through TCDC arrangements to help these people share their coping Ainsi que cela ressort des annexes b) et c) de ce rapport de la onzi\u00e8me session du Comit\u00e9 de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire mondiale, le Congo, notre pays, qui est membre de ce comit\u00e9, a bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux travaux de accro\u00eetre Leur politique de d\u00e9noncer Lesagressions perp\u00e9tr\u00e9es par l'Afrique du Sud dans les pays de La ligne de front en Afrique australe la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire de ces pays.

As regards world food security, it is clearly indicated that the world security situation has improved since the last meeting on world food security because of the increase in food production both the low-income food-deficit countries, although trade stable foods and food aid slightly declined. The problem of undernourishment and malnutrition of people is evident in the developing countries. This is one of the most critical problems of the world. Both the developed and the developing countries have the same common interest in this problem and have made efforts to alleviate it. The other problem is food insecurity. It is important to highlight this food insecurity. The cause of food insecurity lies not only in the recent drought and floods but also in the failure of nations to develop economic systems that generate real income for the poor to help them to this situation of malnutrition. Dietmar KINZEL (Austria): I would like to thank Mr Gonzalez for introducing the Report on the Eleventh Session of the Committee. We have noted with satisfaction, a certain recovery in the world food situation. We are, however, concerned that in a number of lower income food deficit countries in Africa the per capita consumption of food has declined in spite of increased production. We believe that considerable efforts are needed to stabilise and extend the partial su ccess so far achieved, in view of the relatively good crop in 1986, and considering the fa ct that some 60 million people are without any purchasing power. The world food problem seems to be mainly employment problem. production as well as the improvement of storage capacities and the infrastructure of transport great difficulties in selling their surpluses at declining prices in the world market. in the rise industrialised more and more for increasing earnings. In particular, the production of maize, millet and sorghum could be raised in the African region. The overall food situation in Africa thus improved in 1985. The area under cultivation was a bove the average yields and meat production increased, whilst in 1984, 21 countries of the continent still suffered great def iciencies. One year later, this situation was found only in countries. The prices of agricultural products often fell sharply in In terms the world market prices of staple foods dropped to the level of 1966. The recession in export earnings added to the deterioration of the Crade balances recorded over the last ten years. The expert consultations envisaged by the FAO, wich a view co providing the poor with better access to foods, should, in our opinion, also include measures storage facilities for and the improvement of the transport infrastructure undoubtedly deserve our support. As stated in paragraph 40 to 42 when formulating national the developing countries, greater given to roots and tubers, the importance of which has so far been under-estimated. Their production should be encouraged by adequate incentive. Michael J. RYAN (Australia): Australia considers the Committee on Food Security as a most useful mechanism for international consultations on the key issues affecting the state of world food security. In our experience, the Secretariat 's research is thorough and the documentation well prepared and presented, thus we welcome this food insecurity results basically power racher Chan from inadequate physical availability of food at the global level . Con-sequently, a significant share assistance is provided in the forms of food projects, training and research, especially through the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. We are fully aware of the constraints imposed upon the achievements of developing country developed country protectionist trading policies, including subsidisation of agricultural trade. I do not wish to labour this point as we have spoken at length on this subject under a previous seeking the liberalisation of world trade, especially agricultural trade. On the question of pre-positioning of stocks to expedite delivery of emergency food aid we recall that, importantly, the analysis considered by the Committee on Food Security at its Eleventh Session, did not encompass, as an element of total emergency response time, the time required in the recipient country for internal transport and distribution of emergency food aid from the port, or point of entry, to the target beneficiaries. According to the World Food Programme, lack of internal logistics capacity appeared to be a major, if not the most important, handicap to an efficiency emergency response to time-saving realised through pre-positioning aid recipient's port of entry, can be more than offset by lack of pre-positioned emergency aid stock could yield a greater return, in terms of savings in delivery to target beneficiaries, in internal logistics capacity, in emergencies. note that the Twenty-first CFA, earlier this year, considered inter alia the WFP recommendation for improving the operation of IEFR in order to reduce WFP's total emergency response time. Implementation of these recommendations diminish for pre-positioning. On the question of national preparedness planning to cope with food emergencies, Australia believes that the effectiveness of any national preparedness plan depends entirely on a degree of government commitment to it, including the level of authority and resources given to the administrative mechanisms established as part of a plan. In this context, serious political commitment to the nationalisation of agricultural sector policies is essential in countries vulnerable to food emergencies. On the question of the Food Security Assistance Scheme, Australia has contributed a total of around 6. 5 million to specific FSAS activities and, in general, we have been disappointed with the scheme. Some projects appear to have been inadequately designed and very slowly implemented. The FAO's record of reporting to Australia on the expenditure of our contributions and on project progress has, in general, been unsatisfactory. However, we are happy to inform the Council that there has been an improvement in this area in recent months. Nevertheless, Australia supports the CFS request for a more analytical assessment of the scheme in the next review report. I would like to refer to a couple of specific paragraphs in the document before us. On page 2, paragraph 12, we would say that whilst the recent declines in the value the US dollar, real interest rates and petrol prices are likely to improve situation in many developing countries, it is important to noto that they will not n ecessarily benefit all such countries. For example, the depreciation of the US dollar will increase the competitiveness of US exports and will make it more difficult for the developing countries' exports, both agricultural and manufactured, to compete in world markets. Secondly, lower world oil prices will reduce the export revenues of oil exporting developing countries. On page 3, 13, we believe questionable whether the falling prices cost producers in developed countries. The agricultural support systems in both the European Community and the USA insulate farmers from the full effects of world price fluctuations. Consequently it is unlikely that there would output by the least efficient producers in those be by more efficient producers either in the EEC, in the USA, or elsewhere. Finally, a point on paragraph 14, on page 3, the point made regarding the inconsistency of certain developed countries in using subsidies to first produce and dispose of surpluses, we feel is an extremely valid one. of these strongly emphasized. -357- Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos felicitar primeramente por la presentaci\u00f3n del tema que nos hizo nuestro colega y amigo el Ministro Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez. Hizo un recuento pormenorizado de las cuestiones fundamentales, si no de todas, que se examinaron en este per\u00edodo del Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria. Este per\u00edodo del Comit\u00e9 la delegaci\u00f3n de Cuba lo considera como uno de los m\u00e1s fruct\u00edferos de los que se han efectuado en los \u00faltimos tiempos. Fue una discusi\u00f3n bastante amplia, como lo refleja el documento y muy profunda. Puede que el tiempo de abril a noviembre haya hecho variar algunas cuestiones que habr\u00e1 de an\u00e1lizar. Sin embargo, consideramos que este per\u00edodo ha sido digno de que probemos este informe en su totalidad. Nosotros, en realidad, no tenemos observaci\u00f3n alguna, por lo que entendemos que debe ser aprobado por este Consejo. Durante la discusi\u00f3n se ha hecho referencia a algunas de las cuestiones discutidas. No tengo intenci\u00f3n de aburrir un poco con cuestiones que ya han sido discutidas y que este informe recoge con suficiente claridad, si lo aprobamos en todas sus partes. Consideramos que el an\u00e1lisis hecho por el Comit\u00e9 en sectores tan importantes para la seguridad alimentaria mundial, como producci\u00f3n, investigaci\u00f3n, comercio, reservas alimentarias, transacciones triangulares y acceso a los a limentos, demostraron una vez m\u00e1s la importancia que se le da en esta Organizaci\u00f3n a aspectos tan prioritarios como sin luga r a dudas es la seguridad a limentaria y que claramente se pueden constatar en los p\u00e1rrafos 19 a 24 del documento CL 90/10 que se nos presenta. Asimismo, una muestra mis de la preocupaci\u00f3n constante del Director General, es la propuesta hecha al Comit\u00e9 de que se examinaran las perspectivas a plazo medio de suministro y las necesidades mundiales de a limentos con el objeto de mejorar la base anal\u00edtica para la labor. Creo que es una cuesti\u00f3n muy importante. Si no hacemos realmente un an\u00e1lisis de base tendr\u00edamos que seguir machacando sobre las mismas cuestiones. En realidad son dignas de elogio las medidas introducidas por la FAO al elaborar sus proyecciones sobre la base del modelo alimentario mundial, lo cual permiti\u00f3 determinar en forma simult\u00e1nea la oferta, la demanda, el comercio, los precios en el sistema de cereales, semillas oleaginosas, ganader\u00eda y hacer extensivas las proy ecciones a las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y leguminosas. No queremos, como dije al principio, entrar en consideraciones de la situaci\u00f3n mundial de la crisis y los problemas ex\u00f3genos y end\u00f3genos que cada pa\u00eds tiene a la hora de analizar los problemas de la seguridad alimentaria mundial. Pero si teniendo en cuenta la importancia de este 11 \u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial, que para nosotros puede tener repercusiones si llevamos sus acuerdos a seguimiento, porque se puede convertir en un gran recuento de buenos deseos. Creo que lo que hay que buscar es salir de los buenos deseos y entrar en la implementaci\u00f3n de ellos. Teniendo en cuenta esto, esta reuni\u00f3n se efectu\u00f3 en el mes de abril y estamos finalizando noviembre, a mi delegaci\u00f3n le gustar\u00eda conocer en qu\u00e9 estado se encuentra la implementaci\u00f3n de las recomendaciones hechas por el Comit\u00e9, especialmente en lo referente al incremento de las investigaciones y la difusi\u00f3n de sus resultados mediante actividades de extensi\u00f3n y capacitaci\u00f3n, haciendo \u00e9nfasis en la necesidad de asegurar las ventajas de toda mejora de la productividad que llegar\u00e1n a las mujeres, las cuales desempe\u00f1an un importante papel en el cultivo de algunos productos recomendados como las ra\u00edces y los tub\u00e9rculos. Creo que hay que buscar cu\u00e1ndo implementamos y nos interesar\u00eda conocer qu\u00e9 medidas se han tomado para subsanar las deficiencias de los sistemas de comercializaci\u00f3n. Todas estas recomendaciones aparecen en los p\u00e1rrafos 40, 41 y 42 del documento en cuesti\u00f3n. Por lo tanto, creemos que si podemos ya llegar a dos aspectos muy importantes para nosotros, como son la comercializaci\u00f3n\" y la capacitaci\u00f3n, ya hemos ganado algo en la cuesti\u00f3n que ven\u00edamos discutiendo hace mucho tiempo y que este Comit\u00e9 logr\u00f3 reunificar y coordinar ordenadamente. Queremos hacer nuestro planteamiento de acuerdo con la delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico sobre el estudio para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe que se propuso en la Conferencia Regional de la FAO celebrada en Barbados. -358- Dong QING SONG (China) (original language Chinese): First of all I would like to thank Mr Gonz\u00e1lez for his concise and clear introduction to the report of the 11th Session of the Committee on World Food Security and we approve the content of the report. Having said that, allow me to make a few brief comments. First, in recent years world food production has experienced a period of continuous growth. Cr itical food situation in However, as is stated in the report, in paragraph 11, basic food consumption per capita has declined during the present season in about half of the low-income food-deficit countries. Even in countries where this consumption has increased, a very large number of people are still suffering serious malnutrition. This shows that we can in no case neglect the world food situation. Second, as everybody knows, encouragement of food and agricultural production in developing countries is an essential measure for solving the food problem. What has to be done now is to ensure the implementation of such to agriculture in developing their natural economies and for its part the international community should supply financial and technical aid to developing countries for their agricultural production. For several years the Organization has undertaken activities in this sector and they are to be congratulated on this. Third, factors that affect world food security are many. What is essential for developing countries is to rely on their own efforts and on international cooperation to improve their be neglected, factors such as the economic and social environment. For instance, policies for distributing agricultural commodities, the international commercial order and also agricultural assistance and food aid are also closely linked with the achievement of the objective of food security and therefore on this we must all harmonize our efforts. Fourth, as has been indicated in the report, roots, tuber and plantains play a very important role in food security. It is absolutely necessary for FAO to undertake specific studies on this subject so that it given greater priority. Furthermore, FAO has also undertaken a series of global, regional and national activities in the framework of the implementation of the Food Security Assistance Scheme and under-preparedness plans for food emergencies and has achieved a success here. We hope that FAO will continue to play its role in this sector so that the world food security should continually improve. Mohd. Mazlan BIN JUSOH (Malaysia): First let me express my pleasure to see you on the podium chairing this session. My delegation is very pleased with the contents of the document in the report CL 90/10 and would like to commend the Secretariat and give our special thanks to Mr Gonz\u00e1lez as Chairman of the Committee on World Food Security for his clear and comprehensive introduction. We are particularly pleased with the striking recovery made in many which sorghum, and cassava. According to the latest FAO Food in 1986, it seems favourable harvests are assured most regions. Nevertheless there has been mention of concern in some of the papers discussed by the Committee on Rural Food Security regarding the decline in local prices in some of the African countries which have managed to produce surpluses. Therefore, my delegation firmly believes that in order to maintain a momentum of recovery and to provide the proper incentives, a greater surpluses in these countries. Consistent with our stand in our first intervention of this Council session, my delegation thinks fairly harvests of the previously-affected regions. It must be realized that food aid has been a necessity due to the emergency situation and also largely decreases in -359- the opposite way. Perhaps it would be a logical step and even cheaper to transfer funds using export subsidies and other supportive measures to be and technical there seems to the the mainly from the lack of purchasing power of this group. Programmes must therefore be undertaken in trying to improve the access to food for this underprivileged group by providing better incomes and also allowing them grow food themselves. Most of these problems are connected with the economic health of the country itself. In this respect we fully support the call for improving the international economic trading environment in order to stimulate trade and allow market a ccess to agricultural export products of the low-income food-deficit countries. it is now of paramount importance that we should take advantage of the momentum so far achieved to increase food production and totally rehabilitate agriculture in the food-deficit countries. On the role of roots, tubers and plantains, my delegation is supportive the recommendation made by the Committee to intensify efforts for the of exploited to increase the production of these food items which can greatly supplement the diet of the population. Since food and systems. In view of the bulkiness and perishability of these foods, infrastructure for storage, transport and marketing facilities will have to be improved. We support the programmes in this direction. On the proposal to preposition stocks with the intended purpose of expediting delivery food, my delegation wishes to express our reservation on the said proposal if such storage facilities are meant to be built Although we still agree food is n ecessary, perhaps it would be more appropiate to of triangular transaction mechanisms. It should be noted that about 2. 7 million tons of exportable coarse grains are now available from countries such as Benin, Cete d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Sudan, Tonga and Zimbabwe. Twenty-three other countries in Africa require these grains. countries or believes that in this way, emergency response to keep on producing food and alleviate the problem of disposal. In line with this we are supportive of the idea of establishing sub-regional or regional food security reserves. In fact Malaysia is actively involved in the ASEAN food security reserve system which is complementary to our own national food reserves. Such regional or sub-regional food reserve systems would greatly enhance food security and would not be of too great a burden on individual countries. Now with rising stocks worldwide and prices, countries should take up stocks face future emergencies. -360- Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Democratic Republic of) (original language Arabic): First of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Chairman, and tell you how delighted we are to see you in the Chair. We would also like to congratulate Mr Gonzalez clear and precise presentation. We have carefully studied this document on world food security and this perusal was accompanied by some concern for World Food Security, especially in low-income food-deficit countries where the situation has been preoccupying. As appears from the document, the majority of these countries were not in a position to take the n ecessary measures to ensure their food security or co be prepared to meet food emergencies. With this in mind, I would like to review the situation in my country. In spite of the measures taken by the authorities of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen to develop agricultural production and in spice of the resources allocated to chat sector, we are facing enormous difficulties in food security. There are many reasons for this and there is no need for me to go into them here because in a previous statement on the situation of food and agriculture our of Agriculture described these difficulties. Nevertheless, the distinctive aspect is the drought which continues in our country and has been in existence for a very long time. Rains are irregular and they vary in intensity. This has damaging effects on land, irrigation systems and the rural infrastructure as a whole. Added to this is the problem of the desert locusts and grass hoppers which have infested our country this year. This has of course limited our capacity for food production. As was said by the Minister of Agriculture of my country when he spoke on the food and agriculture situation, the world economic situation is not a wholly favourable one. This is why we once again wish to state what was said by our minister. Above all, there is a need for collective activity internationally to ensure food security, to ensure peace and better dialogue between North and South and to prompt a fairer international economic order. We wish once again to affirm the importance of the role of international organizations in the aid they provide for developing countries to improve their agricultural production and solve their food security problems. Therefore what was said during this Council meeting on the need for strengthening FAO resources and those of WFP and IFAD will certainly go towards improving food all developing countries, as shown by the response to the African crisis. Finally, in the interests of brevity, I wish once again to support the comments made by our colleague from Lebanon on emergency measures and also on national preparedness plans for food crisis as well as on national foodstuffs and national stocks. We also support the medium-and short-term study on the Director-General. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I to thanking Mr Gonzalez for his extremely useful has us to further crystalize our views and to understand the direction in which the world community has to move so that we benefit from the progress chat has been made over the last two years, especially in tackling positive trends in development and production in the agricultural field in the developing world. I would like to take this opportunity to state that on the whole a conclusion of the last year or two is that despite the many problems, economic and otherwise, in the world, Asia as a whole has been doing quite well. That ancient continent which of external interest, exploitation and forced sale of goods has also been the first to emerge if one takes it as a major entity. Countries like China, India, Pakistan and the Asian succeeded in solving the basic problems of food production. We have no doubt that in the present atmosphere of international cooperation which seeks to put behind all the nations the rivalries, conflicts, tensions of the past, the concept of food security and food for development, which are interlinked, will have to gain ground. We are also sure that our brothers in Africa and Latin America, who are equally, if not better, endowed than Asia, will think of the role of ourselves, the role of this meeting, is Co see what we can do during this interim period of maybe 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, during which the inevitable course of history can be anticipated to lessen the problems which face those -361- problems. countries in India, the fact that we are agriculturally self-sufficient has not solved many of our problems. Large sections of our population, which we call the weaker sections of society, still do not have adequate employment or nutrition. Therefore the government has to with but with tackling different problems. The government is responsive and thoughtful; action is being taken for rural development programmes, integrated development programmes, which in due course are bound to raise the standards of those who have not directly benefited from the Green Revolution and other agricultural developments. This is true of a number of other countries However, there is no guarantee that particularly smaller countries, who have had similar or even greater agricultural su ccesses, can make the transition. I would think that larger countries always have something to buy or sell and if they are not able to sell one item, they are able to sell something else. But what happens to the smaller countries who have invested so much time and effort and sacrifice in one or two products to make themselves self-sufficient and then find that their surpluses become a burden? It is here in the report, paragraph 21, improvements in the international economic and trading environment, and paragraph 24 regarding triangular transactions. These are all interlinked. On the one hand we are witnessing a certain tussle between developed countries where and production are making for new rivalries. We understand that there are problems even for them in adjusting. After all, there are agricultural groups whose interests have to be met. But I would go along with our Malaysian colleague to state that somewhere we will need to help or encourage those developing countries who have not only but also have surpluses. They cannot immediately compete in the international market as they may not have all the advantages of production or skills but it is better pressures for have substantial surpluses they are unable to sell them, and it is increasingly expensive to store them. If one recalls development in the early part of the century one would find a country such as India, when it was unable to deal with certain political or economic problems, it resorted to a thing called \"non-cooperation\", where one virtually stopped buying things. That is not the world in which we are living today. The fact chat we sit together means that we have a deep interest in each other. Effectively, what is happening is that in a more effective and legitimized way where chose who have the advantages of cheaper production and more efficient production (even in the basic field of agriculture) are able to supply wheat or rice in the neighbourhood of the developing countries which have got surpluses and these developing countries are not able to compete. I do not think that this situation can last forever. To some extent I think we should occupy ourselves with anticipating matters in a cooperative spirit. We in our region, which we have called the SAARC region, have also tried to learn from our colleagues in ASEAN so that we would have regional or sub-regional food reserves. I think also quite useful for many other countries because one country or the other happens to have a surplus in certain items and it can always help a neighbour. I would not like to continue unnecessarily on this report because I think it covers many of our concerns. I should like to end by stating that food security is too important a matter for us to be divided on. Both countries trade. qu'il nous a faite de cette question importante nous pr\u00e9occupe actuellement, constatations principales de passer \u00e0 l'examen du du d\u00e9bat sur la situation de l'agriculture. supportons les Comit\u00e9 contenues dans le 9 des consommation mondiale, mais ils sont concentr\u00e9s dans un petit nombre de pays et restent insuffisants dans la plupart des exc\u00e9dents c\u00e9r\u00e9aliers et la Conf\u00e9rence de la FAO, le Conseil et le Comit\u00e9 de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour la mise en place la diminution de la consommation de base par habitant dans un grand nombre de pays en d\u00e9veloppement; et nous exprimons nos inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation ne diminuerait pas avant la fin de la d\u00e9cade. Nous sommes t\u00e9moins de ce que la la baisse des prix d'exportation seulement production commercial pourra situation actuelle n\u00e9gociations pour Arabic): My like at the outset to express sincere appreciation to the Committee for its commendable efforts in the preparation of the report on world food security. It is heartening to note the increase in food and agricultural production as well as signs of recovery in African economies. Moreover, we the concerns voiced by the Committee decline in food per capita in some developing countries and the balance of payments imbalances resulting effects on the agricultural assessment contained in the document indicates a decline in trade in agricultural products. On this score we reiterate what we have already said while commenting on the document on the situation of Food and Agriculture, namely to express the hope that the multilateral trade negotiations within GATT be su ccessful. However, mere wishful thinking will not suffice. Egypt joins ail those who call for the reform of the international economic order. We fully endorse developing countries in Eleventh Session of CFS. We also welcomed the preparation of a study on trade in agricultural products: its prospects and constraints. We also welcomed the utilising crop in My delegation endorses the conclusions of the Committee as regards the importance and efficiency of national measures in food security. My country is prepared to put its training facilities in the field of remote sensing for forecasting locust attacks and developing countries thus relief programmes. Egypt accords great importance to food security. We have formulated a new agricultural programme based upon the utilisation of modern technology in agriculture, proper linkage between research and extension, provision of necessary investments for this important economic sector, supply of inputs at appropriate prices, and raising the prices of some commodities to bring them closer to world prices. In conclusion, we would like to express our thanks to the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Gonz\u00e1lez, for his lucid and simple introduction of the document. Mohammad Hasan PAIMAN (Afghanistan): My delegation has studied the document CL 90/10 thoroughly, and the report given in the document, as covering most of the problem of food security. Regarding paragraphs 12 and 22, my delegation believes that the economic crises of some developed countries has adversely affected the economic development of developing and low-income countries. As a result of the development of such crises, trade tariffs are increased and more burdens are put upon the exports of developing countries. Ail these obstacles prevent economic development in those countries. This is why the poor do not assist in food production. In recent years, a drastic change in c limatical conditions in Afghanistan has resulted in a major decline of rainfall from 244 mm annual average, to 218 mm in general. It was very variable, as low as 94 mm on average in northern Afghanistan in the current year. Therefore, there is a large deficit in cereals, especially in the wheat crop, as noted-390, 000 tonnes in the current year, as I mentioned in my previous sp eech on document CL 90/9. The drought is not affecting the has dangerously the pastures and forests too. In connection with pastures, we have about 20 million sheep in our country. Out of that, more than 4. 5 million are the Karakul sheep which graze in the northern part of the country. As you know, the Karakul skin is a major earner of foreign cash in our country, but now they are unfortunately severely suffering from drought and especially three of the winter season. The sheep owners are slaughtering these sheep due to the shortage of fodder materials. If any donor organizations do not consider the matter as an urgent case and do not devote emergency aid, the situation will be much more difficult in the near future. -364- On the question of the role of roots, tubers and plantains in food security in sub-Saharan Africa, we would note paragraph 42. In the Democratic Republic of harvest time, after storing they redistribute them to the main consumers at cheap prices. The object of this action is to stabilize the prices of those products which are the main foodstuffs of the people through cutting the middlemen out of the market. The economic benefit and nutritional value of tubers and roots are taught to people in health centres, schools, and other training institutions, and as well through public mass media. Paragraph 48 concerns prepositioning of stocks to WFP but the stocks should be kept at the ports of the donors. WFP has long experience in the distribution of food aid, and by having complete information and statistics they could estimate in which parts of the world food shortage will occur and what should be the facilities for shipment and distribution. As regards national preparedness planning to cope with food emergencies, paragraph 53 is noted. In the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan there is a department of emergencies. The department is in charge of assisting casualties of famine, flood and The mainly distributes foodstuffs, as well as other basic needs. The department also has close contact with other institutions such as Red Crescent societies, municipalities, cooperatives and other social departments, but it is not so powerful and cannot serve well as far as financial materials and funds concerned, so it needs some assistance by donor organiz\u00e1tions, too. We welcome the report in the document as far as that aspect is concerned. Augustine K. OSUBAN (Uganda): Mr Chairman, may I take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at seeing you chairing this session. I should like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on World Food Security for his introduction of the paper. Ugaada participated in the 11th Session of the Committee on World Food Security and we endorse the findings of the Committee. Here I should like to take the opportunity to highlight only a few points. We would like to reiterate the Committee's request that future reviews on world food security should include more information on non-cereal staples, particularly roots, plantains, as these would important of research perishability and these also the to be established and managed multilaterally under some international agency. We feel that as the objective of prepositioning food is to have need intern al and transport infrastructure in recipient countries is equally important. On the question of national preparedness, we fully endorse paragraphs 53 and which governments to establish plans comprising institutions for carrying for and the administrative procedures to enter into force when these are signalled. Regarding the Food Security Assistance Scheme, my delegation appreciates the activities of the Food Security Assistance Scheme, especially its assistance in the preparation and funding of national early warning projects and its assistance to countries preparing national preparedness plans. We believe activities of FSAS could be expanded to reach the target of $10 million established by the Conference. With these remarks, we endorse the report of the Committee. Mr Gonza'lez for his introduction to the report on the Committee on World Food Security, document CL 90/10. As a low-income food-deficit country we attach high priority to the establishment of a global system of food security. Therefore, we welcome any measure that would improve the availability of food grains for the needy and poor in Asia, Africa and Latin America. On the national front, agriculture, irrigation and rural development has been accorded high priority in allocation of funds in our Third Five Year Plan, and we in Bangladesh expect to achieve food self-sufficiency in the not too distant future. Although achievement of food security is the primary concern of national governments, in the intervening years LDCs will need food aid and other imports to promote agricultural development, particularly increased production of food grains. These countries will also need food aid to existing food gap. Therefore, we strongly urge continuation of food aid and other economic assistance to increase food production in these countries. As a matter of policy, Bangladesh is trying to set up a national food security reserve to meet unforeseen contingencies and disasters. Bangladesh is also working toward the establishment of a South Asian Food Security Reserve in cooperation with regional countries. A meeting on the South Asian Food Security Reserve will be held shortly in Bangkok. We hope such a proposal will receive the s upport of the donor countries, FAO and other multilateral agencies. Our delegation endorses the report generally of the CWFS session, and we hope that the positive suggestions will be put into effect. Mrs. Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): What I wanted to talk about is something which was referred to by the delegate of Mexico, and I would like to touch on it, that is the question of transnationals. I believe that a report has gone to the Transnational Committee in the United Nations in New York and that we will be able to study such a report in the FAO Council. I want to encourage people to think about transnationals. One country in this world, not my own, has invested $62 billion in different transnational companies abroad. We struggled to get some of that, and we got $19 billion of it. We were very happy. The Governors of our States competed. We had a tremendous fight. The Governor of Tennessee wanted the plant, and the Governor of Missouri wanted the same plant, and they were entertaining people and offering. Why do we want foreign investment in this way? Because they pay taxes, because that is what pays for our schools, because that is what maintains our roads. Some of these transnational companies built new plants, which was wonderfuL; there were whole new buildings and employment. It has been spoken of here. I think the dele gate of Austria talked of 600 million w ithout any purchasing power in this world. But I would like to say something else to the developing countries: be sure that you You cannot sign up blindly with some companies. In Rome there is an Organization called the International Development Law Institute. It has been set up with foundation and other funds and it is operating here in Rome. What does it do? It allows lawyers, or would-be lawyers, which governments want to send to Rome to study these international and contract laws. There are professors, some of them seconded by their universities or businesses to teach contract and international law so that when a company comes in and says, \"Now let us have a wonderful deal, \" the government can say, \"Indeed, that is perfect and we have just the lawyer who will be able to talk to you about these interesting things. \" I cannot emphasize too much the International Development Law Institute. It was started with foundation money just as IRRI was, the Rice Institute in Los Ba\u00f1os, and now it is also getting money from the United States government through our aid. -366- Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Tambi\u00e9n yo quiero felicitar al se\u00f1or Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez, representante de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina ante la FAO, que en su calidad de Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial, nos present\u00f3 con mucha competencia el documento 90/10. Nuestra intenci\u00f3n en esta oportunidad es la de reiterar la solicitud de que la FAO realice un estudio sobre la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe que contenga un plan de acci\u00f3n para el sector de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n. Esto mismo fue solicitado al Director General por la Conferencia Regional de la FAO para Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe celebrada en Barbados en Agosto del a\u00f1o en curso y se especific\u00f3 el enfoque y el contenido que deber\u00eda tener ese estudio. Tambi\u00e9n deseamos apoyar aqu\u00ed la iniciativa del Presidente de Colombia, Sr. Virgilio Barco Vargas, de convocar una reuni\u00f3n para emprender una lucha activa y coordinada para erradicar la pobreza absoluta de nuestra regi\u00f3n. Esperamos que la FAO est\u00e9 en capacidad de participar en esa reuni\u00f3n, una vez convocada. A nadie escapa que la regi\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe est\u00e1 atravesando la peor crisis econ\u00f3mica de su historia y que el sector de la agricultura y la alimentaci\u00f3n se encuentra muy deprimido. Coincidimos con el documento 90/10 en que existen factores internos y externos que limitan la producci\u00f3n y la distribuci\u00f3n de los alimentos en los pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo. La principal causa interna es la pobreza, pero los pa\u00edses que estamos haciendo grandes esfuerzos para disminuir la pobreza nos encontramos con una serie de factores limitantes externos de car\u00e1cter econ\u00f3mico, financiero y comercial enumerados en la parte II del documento 90/10: evaluaci\u00f3n de la situaci\u00f3n actual de la seguridad alimentaria mundial, particularmente en los p\u00e1rrafos 12, 14 y 21. Creemos en el concepto revisado de seguridad alimentaria en el plano mundial debe ser asegurar que todas las personas tengan en todo momento acceso material y econ\u00f3mico a los a limentos que n ecesitan. Este concepto realizado puede ser una realidad s\u00f3lo a trav\u00e9s de la concertaci\u00f3n de las voluntades pol\u00edticas de la Comunidad Internacional, de los pa\u00edses industrializados y los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. En el caso espec\u00edfico de Nicaragua, la voluntad pol\u00edtica nacional de lograr un desarrollo gradual y uniforme de nuestras fuerzas productivas tropiezan no s\u00f3lo con los factores negativos externos, de car\u00e1cter econ\u00f3mico, financiero y comercial, sino tambi\u00e9n con una agresi\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica que no tiene justificaci\u00f3n alguna y que nos obliga a mantener involucrados en la defensa de la soberan\u00eda a m\u00e1s de 200 mil personas que equivalen al 20 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3micamente activa, a quienes se les destina el 10 por ciento del producto material del consumo b\u00e1sico. Para concluir, apoyamos el contenido de ios p\u00e1rrafos 22 y 23 referentes a las reservas alimentarias y el p\u00e1rrafo 24 sobre las transacciones triangulares, y el p\u00e1rrafo 20 sobre la investigaci\u00f3n para aumentar la productividad agr\u00edcola de los pa\u00edses de bajos ingresos y con d\u00e9ficit de alimentos, dando prioridad ai mejoramiento de los cultivos alimentarios aut\u00f3ctonos, como las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y pl\u00e1tanos. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Vamos a ser muy breves porque, en primer lugar, s\u00f3lo queremos expresar el apoyo de la delegaci\u00f3n de Venezuela a la aprobaci\u00f3n de este informe, pero aunque sea brevemente, quer\u00edamos referirnos al. contenido del p\u00e1rrafo 35 con relaci\u00f3n a los estudios sobre las ra\u00edces tub\u00e9rculos y pl\u00e1tanos que deben incluirse en el estudio propuesto en la Conferencia de Barbados para la Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. Desde hace mucho tiempo a nosotros nos ha correspondido llamar la atenci\u00f3n sobre este problema de la atenci\u00f3n que deber\u00eda prestar la FAO a estos cultivos aut\u00f3ctonos y muy especialmente a Las ra\u00edces, tub\u00e9rculos y pl\u00e1tanos, y a lo que la FAO llama cereales secundarios, que nosotros nos oponemos a esta denominaci\u00f3n porque no podemos considerar que haya cereales principales y cereales secundarios. Ya dijimos una vez que entre los cultivos m\u00e1s antiguos est\u00e1 precisamente el del ma\u00edz, el del arroz, y esos no pueden llamarse cereales secundarios, pero las circunstancias del predominio econ\u00f3mico hacen que hayan sido aplazados y colocados y nosotros queremos traerlos a su sitio correcto. -367- Pero hoy vamos a pasar a lo que llamamos cultivos aut\u00f3ctonos, que son las ra\u00edces, los tub\u00e9rculos, los pl\u00e1tanos y otros cultivos\" ind\u00edgenas como yo prefiero llamarlos. El car\u00e1cter perentorio de estos productos es lo que hace que el comercio no les d\u00e9 la importancia que ellos requieren, precisamente porque con el desarrollo de la agricultura comercial estos productos no pueden ser almacenados, no pueden ser transportados, porque no est\u00e1n en condiciones de resistir, porque todav\u00eda los pa\u00edses llamados desarrollados no han descubierto c\u00f3mo conservarlos para mantenerlos en condiciones de rendimiento comercial, y es por eso por lo que todav\u00eda en el desarrollo de la investigaci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola que actualmente avanza en el mundo, estas potencias comerciales no han ca\u00eddo ni en la yuca, ni en el ocumo, ni en el ma\u00edz, yo puedo dar una lista de ellos, son m\u00e1s de 20 productos, de estos productos aut\u00f3ctonos que son y han constituido la base de la alimentaci\u00f3n de nuestros pueblos ind\u00edgenas. Por supuesto, ya hace mucho tiempo que los pl\u00e1tanos pasaron a la primera categor\u00eda, desde que las grandes empresas transnacionales bananeras descubrieron c\u00f3mo transportarlos, si bien quienes sabemos lo que es comer un pl\u00e1tano o una banana en su verdadero momento de consumo y comerlo en cualquier pa\u00eds europeo despu\u00e9s de que han pasado cinco semanas navegando en un barco, sabemos muy bien que hay una gran diferencia de uno a otro; pero ellos no conocen aqu\u00ed lo que es una banana en buenas condiciones y est\u00e1n muy felices con lo que comen ac\u00e1, y de esa manera pueden consumirlos y satisfacer las necesidades del comercio de quienes lo producen. La misma cosa pasa con los tub\u00e9rculos y con las ra\u00edces. Estos productos no est\u00e1n realmente hechos por la naturaleza para ser guardados en dep\u00f3sitos como el trigo, sometidos a procesos industriales para conservarlos en forma de corn flakes, en forma de germen de trigo, en forma de grano o como cualquier cosa que quieran llamar, no s\u00e9 como lo llaman los italianos, cruspa , o cualquier conserva de esas. No se presta para hacer esa dicotom\u00eda de venderle a uno el g\u00e9rmen de trigo, a otros la harina de trigo y ahora la integral y la perfeccionada, la revisada, etc. De esa manera el comercio es m\u00e1s floreciente. Con la yuca y el ocumo y estos otros productos no se ha podido todav\u00eda llegar a ese refinamiento, y es por esa raz\u00f3n que no han merecido la atenci\u00f3n que mereci\u00f3 la papa o que ha merecido el ma\u00edz o que han merecido otros frutos. Esos productos corresponden m\u00e1s bien a la agricultura de subsistencia y ya ustedes ven c\u00f3mo Afganist\u00e1n, c\u00f3mo Uganda, c\u00f3mo cualquiera de ios pa\u00edses africanos y algunos de nuestros pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica Latina-estoy viendo la cara de Guillermo, el delegado de Argentina que dice que nosotros no comemos eso, o probablemente los del Cono-Sur de Am\u00e9rica, nosotros no comemos eso, pero nosotros los de los sitios intertropicales s\u00ed porque nosotros sabemos lo que es eso, lo que es una yuca, lo que es un ocumo, etc. M\u00e9xico dice que tampoco lo come; pero de todas maneras, esos son los productos que la naturaleza ha dado a esas latitudes ecuatoriales, a esas latitudes intertropicales y \u00bfporqu\u00e9 raz\u00f3n no puede la FAO, y los organismos que corresponden a las Naciones Unidas que tienen centros de investigaci\u00f3n dedicados a ello, dedicarse a que los habitantes de esos pa\u00edses los cultiven en mejores condiciones? Digo que corresponde a la agricultura de subsistencia porque es precisamente en los huertos familiares en donde pueden servir el consumo de la familia, sin n ecesidad de que los saquen y los pongan en el refrigerador o los metan en el freezer . Ellos pueden estar all\u00ed sembrados y ser utilizados progresivamente sin n ecesidad de sacarlos y ponerlos amontonados en dep\u00f3sitos, como se est\u00e1 planteando en este informe. Estos cultivos, pues, podr\u00edan ser desarrollados en sus mejores condiciones y servir a la alimentaci\u00f3n de estos pa\u00edses en estas condiciones naturales que es como ellos realmente tienen un valor nutritivo. Hay algo que no quiero dejar de pasar por alto y es el hecho de que en ios pa\u00edses llamados desarrollados se est\u00e1 comenzando a hacer la reclan de los llamados alimentos org\u00e1nicos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 son los alimentos org\u00e1nicos?. Usted va a cualquiera de esas ciudades-no voy a mencionar alguna, voy a mencionar a Boston en la cual yo m\u00e1s he vivido-y all\u00ed hay unos peque\u00f1os mercados nuevos en donde se venden estos alimentos org\u00e1nicos, bastante caros, no tienen un precio barato. \u00bfQu\u00e9 son los alimentos org\u00e1nicos? Son alimentos cultivados sin fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, que son buenos para la salud y que no producen esto, esto y lo otro. Esos son Los alimentos org\u00e1nicos que no se producen con estas artificiosas maneras de rendir. -368- \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 raz\u00f3n estas peque\u00f1as atrasadas comunidades tienen que ser obligadas a comer alimentos sofisticados mediante todo ese procesamiento de que son objeto, con art\u00edculos comerciales, cuando ellos pueden ser ense\u00f1ados a cultivar sus huertos familiares en donde el ama de casa va y arranca su yuca y la cocina ella misma, donde se cosecha el racimo de pl\u00e1tanos para consumirlo, y lo mismo con cualquiera de los tub\u00e9rculos, que son una lista larga y algunos de ellos excelentes, mucho mejor que la papa? Entonces, pues, nosotros podr\u00edamos, a trav\u00e9s de la FAO, reeducar a estas comunidades para persuadirlas, estimulando el cultivo de estos productos, de que esa es una alimentaci\u00f3n satisfactoria para conservar la salud, y que as\u00ed como de repente los investigadores del primer mundo descubrieron que la papaya tiene una gran cantidad de vitaminas, lo descubrieron, pero hace cuesti\u00f3n de 50 a\u00f1os no la com\u00edan porque daba fiebre y de repente descubrieron que era muy buena, y que la guayaba tiene gran cantidad de vitaminas, pero es cuando ellos lo descubren que se convierten en buenas, mientras tanto la desprecian, nadie las presta atenci\u00f3n y los pobres campesinos de esos pa\u00edses atrasados que lo consumen se sienten un poco acomplejados y quieren comer manzanas, peras, fresas, etc. cuando ellos tienen all\u00e1 su guayaba y su lechosa y los productos tropicales que son de gran valor nutritivo, de gran valor alimenticio. Mi conclusi\u00f3n es que la FAO, al lado de la investigaci\u00f3n de la utilidad de esos productos y de la ense\u00f1anza para estas comunidades de c\u00f3mo deben cultivarlos, va a tener que decirles tambi\u00e9n que ellos tienen una fuente de vitaminas, de alimentos de verdadera capacidad nutritiva y que verdaderamente deben consumirlos y cultivarlos y no que seamos agentes del cambio de alimentaci\u00f3n para que coman trigo y papas cuando ellos no producen eso. Digo el trigo y la papa porque son los m\u00e1s universalmente apreciados en Europa. Por esa raz\u00f3n mi intervenci\u00f3n va a detenerse aqu\u00ed porque ped\u00ed apenas dos minutos y creo que he sobrepasado el tiempo, pienso que los pa\u00edses desarrollados, y la FAO como representantes de los intereses de todos los pa\u00edses, pudiera en su investigaci\u00f3n, en su programa de capacitaci\u00f3n dar orientaci\u00f3n a estos pa\u00edses, y me est\u00e1n acompa\u00f1ando en esto Afganist\u00e1n, Uganda y otro pa\u00eds; hablo sobre el uso que debemos darle, la importancia que tienen los tub\u00e9rculos, las ra\u00edces, los pl\u00e1tanos y las frutas tropicales en la alimentaci\u00f3n, en el beneficio de la alimentaci\u00f3n de esos pueblos. Termino con esto porque en todo lo dem\u00e1s creo que es innecesario, pero este es un punto que est\u00e1 muy cercano a mi inter\u00e9s de la investigaci\u00f3n que yo he hecho, que he estudiado, y por eso se que vamos a necesitar todav\u00eda un trabajo largo para regresar al punto de que los pa\u00edses se convenzan de que lo que ellos tienen es bueno y no tienen que estar aspirando a lo que tienen los dem\u00e1s. CHAIRMAN: Before giving the floor to the following speaker may I repeat the plea of our independent Chairman, Mr Lassaad Ben Osman, when he said that given the time constraints delegates are requested to be as possible. MUSHARRAF (Pakistan): You have given me a very difficult task. But please cut me short immediately whenever you feel so inclined. Unfortunately, it has to be abruptly cut short because I do not think I am able to summarise it! I am very happy that I am speaking just after the delegate of Venezuela because I will have a chance to refer to her in glowing terms towards the end of the statement-if we come to that at all! First let me thank the Chairman of the Food Security Committee for the very clear and useful introduction. At the very first page of the document, at the inside of the cover page, the Secretariat has drawn the attention of the Council to only three aspects of the Committee's report as listed on the inside of the cover page of the document, which is page ii. I will therefore confine my intervention to these aspects turn by turn. It is good to be reminded in the document at page 25 that the ultimate objective of the world food security as agreed to -369- under the revised concept of food security is to ensure that all people at all times have both physical and economic access to the basic food they need. We would like to refer a little later in passing to some of the things this definition logically implies, aspects to which the Committee's report, perhaps due to its brevity, has not been able to touch upon. A second thing to keep in mind is that food security can be conceived at several levels, at the global level, at the regional level and national level, at the household Level and even beyond, at the individual level. Furthermore, distinction is to be made between chronic of food availability and food a ccess. It is the former type, the chronic insecurity that has proved to be the most intractable. Turning to the agreed role or the definition itself, one may point to two noteworthy aspects of it, first that food security should be ensured to all people at all times. This part of the definition would seem to create problems conflicts and trade-offs between achieving security for one group of people against another so that security may not simultaneously be achieved for all groups, to one, the producers versus the consumers, rural versus urban and so on. Similarly, there often is a conflict between the short-term and the long run so that the phrase \"At all times\" does not recognize this trade off: as, for example, between achieving rapid growth for the future and short-term satisfaction of needs, Policies therefore need to is when it says \"Physical and economic access to the basic food they need\". The word \"basic\" begs a question. \"Basic food needs\", from what point of view? Basic from the point of view of preventing death? Basic from the point of view of preventing severe health risks or stunting of growth among children; or basic from the point of view of active role and participation in life and work for an individual? Which point of view is selected would determine the clientele, the number of food insecure people to be catered for. From the economic point of view, the human capital aspect, the last one of these points may be the more relevant point of view to adopt so that the number of food insecure people in the world would, according to some estimates, be-nearly one billion, that is one thousand million people. Given this broader definition that we in the Committee on Food Security have been entrusted with, the implication is that the focus has to be on security at the household individual level and for the chronic long-term insecurity. The food situation in the world seems to be riddled with paradoxes. While the world seems to be awash with grain, as it were, with production going through bumper crop after bumper crop and surpluses, phrasing of the Director-General in his speech the other day, which is attached to this document were in many cases hard to market, lending to the real danger that for small farmers good harvests turn out to be as disastrous as the bad ones. Coming down from the global level to the regional and country levels in a region such as Africa the picture does not even contain the paradox of poverty amongst plenty. Here situation does, however, seem to contain a paradox of a different sort. The representative of Tanzania, the Minister of Agriculture, the other day had in his wise intervention described Africa as the youngest continent asking the elder for help. Africa may indeed be the youngest continent in many respects, may be more important for our purposes agriculturally. However, it has had a long hunting and pastoral tradition and is not young therefore in that respect but has less of settled and sedentary agriculture. What appears to be a paradox is that in a continent in which historically all the biotic pressures of degradation presumably have been more on animal resources rather than on land resources given the lower land mass ratio compared to other continents, it is surprising that the land resources should be facing degradation more than in other continents, while the animal life is not under such a great threat. Purely a priori would not one have expected advance one, that has a broader significance. The hypothesis is that the wildlife and their had indeed been equally or but timely human intervention and human resolve saved it. They did not start in Tanzania with a couple of dedicated naturalists-I think they were Germans-resolving the Government machinery they said \"Serengeti shall not die\" which subsequently became the title of their pioneering book. Whatever credit one may like to give to the German couple, the essential fact is chat the first and necessary step, though not a sufficient step, in rehabilitating and safeguarding the land resource base of Africa as was the case in the wildlife base, will be the human resolve, the human commitment and the priority, as indeed is the very first point in the FAO's four point strategy for Africa. Long-term food security hopefully will follow from that. Serengeti was outstandingly alive 20 years ago when I saw it and must, I hope, be so today. We from the young as well as the old continents may resolve once more that Serengeti shall not die and with it Africa shall not die. The lesson of Serengeti might be that serious resolutions do matter. Of course, when one talks of food security many matters besides mere resolve are at play. So many complex and overlapping factors have to be addressed by policy, overall agricultural production, the kind of factors involving aid and trade, and so on and in all the areas Listed at paragraph 25 of the document which are listed as the factors one may comment on the last of these, namely what is stated at paragraph 25. Whatever these factors, however, the implication of really adopting the broader definition and conception for the work and the document of this Committee would be incorporating and emphasizing more than at present nutrition and the consumption consideration of the type contained in FAO's world food survey which, in turn, might mean that several other FAO Divisions, such as the Division and the Policy Analysis Division should be servicing the Committee along with the Trade and Commodities Division. If the conclusions drawn throughout are that the food security at the more important household and individual levels will continue to stagnate or deteriorate, the obvious itical factors or causes behind this? Food insecurity at the household level has often been attributed to lack of purchasing power which, in turn, is considered to be rooted in poverty. But poverty itself is a cause and one has to identify what causes it. It is often recognized that in some poverty may be rooted in the distribution of income and assets within and across the countries. In many cases, access to capital and other yield increasing inputs may mirror rural, economic and political hierarchies, making it more difficult for smaller, poor farmers to increase their production. In other words, man himself, in his institutions and his policies and in his political views or opinions, actually determines the state of security or insecurity in the world. Often to increase food production as rapidly as possible with an explicit or tacit assumption that increased production will benefit the hungry but if the position of the poor in the vulgar setting of political and economic structures is seen, the possibility cannot be discounted that increased those who are already undernourished. Thus while on the one hand is the perception, the more conventional perception, that it would be to the benefit of the poor to have food production increased as quickly and as efficiently as possible through an open market system and market expansion etc. , there is also the perspective that stresses the significant prior attempts to increase food production. According to this perspective there can be strategies that both increase total production and meet basic food needs. But they are possible only after significant changes have place in existing land holding, wealth concentration, consumption patterns, and so on. The contention is that existing structures act as impediments to both greater productivity and food security. The policy implications of perceptions which may be parts of the world obviously have that usually not mentioned national governments the role roots, tubers and plantains, which is the second aspect to which the Council's attention has been drawn in this document, the inclusion of the special agenda item in the last session of the CFA is a tribute to and in no small measure due to the keen interest, almost to a crusading degree, of some delegates and colleagues of ours, in particular the Ambassador of Venezuela, Madame Fermin G\u00f3mez, who spoke just now. The importance of roots and tubers is little recognized. Sweet potatoes mixed with milk makes an excellent breakfast, and a tumbler of raw potato juice drunk early in the importance of root been somewhat underrated in the document itself when at page 39 it says that roots and tubers are low in protein so that diets which heavily on them would be nutritionally first part of the is namely that they are important protein the fact that in the calorie-deficient diets of poor people, who are the major consumers of roots and tubers, these protein-poor foods prevent the conversion of proteins into in the body thus could be recounted ad infinitum . Suffice it to say that the image of these products needs to be improved, as pointed out in paragraph 42. As my delegation's contribution to building up the image of these heroes among the vegetable kingdom, I will recount to you the following true occurrence. A French gentleman by the name of M. Lotito from the town of Evreux performed a fe at at the end of March 1977 which has since enshrined his name in the annals of the annual Guinness Book of Records. M. Lotito was very much, like Her Excellency Madame Gomez, an ardent believer in roots and tubers. His painstaking researches in this field had convinced him that there were many more roots and tubers in the world than are commonly recognized, and one of his original discoveries was that a bicycle is in fact a root and tuber. He held that in its original habitat, namely the streets of mid-19th century Europe, the bicycle was the \"root\" to. progress. Besides it was also the first ever tuber, since it was at the time the only thing that rested and moved on tubes, pneumatic tubes. dispute brilliant theoretical niceties of his, unassailable empirical verification and substantiation of his theory-and this is the true part of the story. He ate the complete bicycle, with the tires, tubes, handles, body, every bit of consequences, but rather beneficial ordinary root and tuber. This story can be verified by anybody by looking at page 535 of th e 1983 edition of the Guinness Book of Records, whose factual authenticity is always immaculate. M. Lotito, besides thus improving the image of roots and tubers, achieved something even greater, he domonstrated that if bicycles can be eaten with benefit because they are tubers so can other possible hard tubers, such as all types of guns and weapons, all of which are basically barrel-like tubes. The implication this significance, since weapons, if eaten, can be harmless, while if in other ways, can destroy humanity. M. Lotito, therefore, like Her Excellency Madame Gomez, will go down as a true pioneer of our times. The last we heard of M. Lotito was that he was conferred the highest national honours by the French Government and other western countries and the world's arms industry for demonstrating that there is nothing inherently abominable about guns and bombs: it is the use to which they are put by the users and recipient Third World countries which is perverse. They can eat them, if they like, to fill their empty stomachs, rather than throw them at matters, perhaps of less importance, namely the economic aspects of roots tubers in relation to cereal alternatives mentioned in paragraph 40 the broader question of, problems one aspect of the of poverty or only aspect of the problem of poverty? I think not in many ways. The rest of the intervention, which is rather long, I might leave until especially for leaving the rest of his intervention to the next meeting, and since he is my friend, he will take my comment as a joke, I am sure. With that we have exhausted the list of speakers and if there are no other delegates who ask for the floor I think I can give the floor to Dr Islam to respond to some of the queries and to make some comments. Nural ISLAM (Assistant Director-General, Economic and Social Policy Department): I will respond to a very few queries which have been made in the course of the debate. The delegate of Colombia enquired about the timing of the expert consultation on measures to improve access to food by the poor, which is mentioned in the document. We planned to hold this expert consultation in the third quarter of 1987. However, due to resource constraints we had to revise our plans and it will not now be possible to hold the consultation in this biennium. However, we hope to present a paper on the subject to the Committee on World Food Security at its sessi on in 1988. The delegate of the United Kingdom asked about the status of the study on expanding trade among developing countries and whether this study will be presented to the Committee on Food Security. This study is already at a very advanced stage and we hope to publish it in 1987. This subject, however, is not included in the agenda of the Committee on Food Security. It will be put to the Committee on Commodity Problems at its session in October 1987. The delegate of Australia stressed that the advantages that could flow from prepositioning stocks need to be compared with the time saving that can result from improving the port handling, transport and logistics within the recipient countries. We quite agree capactiy of the recipient countries to handle and transport food aid that is received. However, we would like to point out that this problem of logistics and transport facilities within the recipient countries being food aid imports of receiving countries, which, as the document presented to the Co mmittee pointed out, could be Committee invited the Committee Food to consider the question of upgrading internal transport and storage infrastructure at a future meeting. We hope that the conclusions of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes on this subject will make an important contribution in dealing with this question. To conclude, action on both fronts, namely a more expeditious delivery of the food aid and more efficient handling of food aid in the receiving countries, are mutually complementary and action needs to be on both fronts. Reference was made by many delegates to the need for more complete coverage of roots and tubers in the analysis of the world food security situation. We have been doing this for some time and will certainly expand this coverage as data and information on this subject is improved. In this connection I may mention that there are two documents which will be presented at the forthcoming meeting, one in the Committee on Agriculture earlier this year entitled \"Strategies and Requirements for Improved Production of Roots, Tubers and Plantains\", and the second document at the next year's Committee on Food Security on the role of roots, tubers and plantains in food security covering both the Latin-American and Caribbean as well as the Pacific regions. Referring to the comments made by delegates on the Food Security Assistance Scheme, I would like to recall that the Deputy Director-General in intervention referred to initiatives taken to have evaluations made of FAO programmes. The Food Security Assistance Scheme is one of the special action programmes which is being currently evaluated by a team of external consultants. Their report will be submitted next year to the Programme Committee, the Council and the Conference in conjunction with the review of the Regular Programme. The Council can accordingly expect it at its 92nd Session in November 1987. -373- Guillermo Enrique GONZALEZ (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de la Seguridad Alimentaria Mundial): Solamente dos palabras. En primer t\u00e9rmino, para agradecer las gen tiles palabras que muchos de ustedes tuvieron el gesto de se\u00f1alar durante sus intervenciones. Segundo, el m\u00e1s importante, comprometer a todos los miembros del Comit\u00e9 para que participen en el pr\u00f3ximo per\u00edodo de sesiones con el mejor esp\u00edritu de cooperaci\u00f3n ya que les puedo asegurar que tenemos una agenda muy interesante, pero les advierto desde ya, muy extensa, y tendremos que hacer un esfuerzo todos nosotros para poder estudiarla y analizarla en la medida en que se merece. CHAIRMAN: I shall try to be as brief as you because I shall not attempt a summing up. Indeed, I believe in any case that the discussion followed in gene ral terms the support of the Committee, so my summing up would be a repetition chapter by chapter of the report. In the course of the discussion some new ideas emerged and some ideas were re-emphasized. However, as I have indicated time constraints can only lead me to the broad conclusion that our Council finds the work of the Food Security Committee very useful and is satisfied with the report of the Committee. Therefore, the Council endorses the report before us. With those brief words I think I have fulfilled my duty. Before pro ceeding further I give the floor to the Secretary- General who wishes to du Comit\u00e9 des For\u00eats, point 6 de son ordre du la s\u00e9ance du Conseil. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Ciertamente no quiero interferir el plan de trabajo de la Secretar\u00eda, pero creo que hemos tenido una intensa jornada, estamos cansados al final de un largo d\u00eda. Sr. Presidente, no ser\u00eda tal vez provechoso prolongar la reuni\u00f3n del Consejo y retardar la reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Creo que con buena voluntad ma\u00f1ana temprano y con presidentes tan din\u00e1micos y eficaces como el colega Iskit de esta tarde, podremos avanzar; lo m\u00e1s prudente ahora es levantar la reuni\u00f3n y permitir al Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n que avance en sus trabajos ya que tenemos muchas cosas pendientes. CHAIRMAN: The chair is in your hands. If delegates so desire we can adjourn now until tomorrow but I must draw your attention to the fact that we are very much behind our schedule. We have so many items before us. With these pressures, I repeat I can only follow the wishes of the Council. However since there is a proposal perhaps it could be seconded. I want to emphasize that I am not following a strict procedure. However, if the Council is a little reluctant to continue-we are in your hands. Are there any other remarks on this particular subject? E. Vernon WADE-BROWN (United Kingdom): I have just received a signal from my delegation leader and he has indicated that he on repeat words expressed by the Chairman and the distinguished delegate of the United Kingdom. We have a lot of work to do and we have to carry on as much as possible. -374- Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I want to support the United Kingdom delegation. CHAIRMAN: So we now have several delegates who wish to continue the work. If other delegates do not have very strong feelings about stoppping now, I think we may continue at least for a while. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): \u00bfSer\u00eda acaso posible que la Secretar\u00eda dispusiera de un equipo adicional de int\u00e9rpretes que permitiera sesionar simult\u00e1neamente el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n con el Consejo? LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL: Nous n'avons pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 le et une du Conseil demain soir. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sigamos entonces, Sr. Presidente. CHAIRMAN: I think the Council has decided to go on, I thank you for your courage. With chat I leave the chair to our Independent Chairman Mr Ben Osman. Lassaad Ben Osman, Independent Chairman of la Lassaad Ben Osman, Presidente independiente del Consejo. III. ACTIVITIES OF FAO AND WFP (continued) III. ACTIVITES DE LA FAO ET DU PAM (suite) III. ACTIVIDADES DE LA FAO Y DEL PMA (continuaci\u00f3n) 6. Report of the Eighth Session of the Committee on Forestry (Rome, 21-25 April 1986 ) 6. Rapport la huiti\u00e8me session du Comit\u00e9 des for\u00eats (Rome, 21-25 avril 1986) 6. Informe del octavo per\u00edodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Montes (Roma, 21-25 de abril de 1986) LE PRESIDENT: Nous allons poursuivre nos travaux. Je donne la parole \u00e0 M. M. A. Flores Rodas, qui va faire un expos\u00e9 introductif. M. A. FLORES RODAS (Subdirector General Departmento de Montes): La octava sesi\u00f3n del Co mit\u00e9 de Montes que se llev\u00f3 a cabo del 21 al 25 de abril del corriente a\u00f1o se caracteriz\u00f3 por un alto nivel de participaci\u00f3n y de asistencia: m\u00e1s de 200 participantes de 93 pa\u00edses miembros asistieron a ella. -375- Las discusiones demostraron una preocupaci\u00f3n profunda sobre los efectos negativos, a nivel socioecon\u00f3mico y ecol\u00f3gico de la destrucci\u00f3n incontrolada de los recursos forestales. En este contexto se discutieron las interacciones entre las actividades forestales y la conservaci\u00f3n de un medio ambiente productivo, la seguridad alimentaria y el aumento de las rentas del empleo para la poblaci\u00f3n particularmente al sector m\u00e1s pobre. Especial atenci\u00f3n merecieron las carencias de le\u00f1a y de energ\u00eda basada en la madera. Muchas de estas discusiones hicieron m\u00e1s \u00e9nfasis en la justicia social y en la contribuci\u00f3n de estas actividades forestales al desarrollo, que a los asuntos puramente t\u00e9cnicos. Los dos puntos de pol\u00edtica discutidos se centraron sobre el papel de las industrias forestales, el transporte, mercado y comercio de los productos forestales en el desarrollo socioecon\u00f3mico, y en el mayor reconocimiento de los niveles p\u00fablicos y pol\u00edticos a la importancia de los bosques para mejorar la calidad de la vida. El Plan de Acci\u00f3n Forestal en los Tr\u00f3picos, preparado por la FAO, fue reconocido como una oportunidad \u00fanica para mejorar las pol\u00edticas y estrategias existentes y para llevar a cabo programas forestales innovativos que sean una verdadera respuesta a las necesidades de desarrollo de los pa\u00edses tropicales. El Plan est\u00e1 recibiendo un apoyo muy fuerte de parte de todos los pa\u00edses que lo consideran como un marco coherente para aumentar y armonizar las asistencias t\u00e9cnicas y financieras en materias forestales. El Comit\u00e9 reconoci\u00f3 el liderazgo y el papel central que la FAO debe ejercer en la puesta en pr\u00e1ctica de este Plan y en su traducci\u00f3n en acciones concretas a los niveles ya sean de pa\u00eds, subregional y regional. Tambi\u00e9n recomend\u00f3 que durante la identificaci\u00f3n de las prioridades para el futuro programa de trabajo para el Departamento de Montes se tenga muy en cuenta a los an\u00e1lisis que condujeron a la formulaci\u00f3n del Plan de Acci\u00f3n Forestal en los Tr\u00f3picos. Asimismo, el Comit\u00e9 recomend\u00f3 que la m\u00e1s alta prioridad debe continuar d\u00e1ndose a las actividades forestales y al desarrollo rural. El Comit\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n recomend\u00f3 que el Director General presentara un informe al Consejo sobre los requisitos financieros necesarios para la protecci\u00f3n y el desarrollo de los bosques del mundo, con particular referencia al Plan de Acci\u00f3n. En conclusi\u00f3n, esta Octava Sesi\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Montes puede ser considerada como una de las m\u00e1s constructivas en que, sin duda alguna, se reflej\u00f3 el alto grado de inter\u00e9 s del Comit\u00e9 tanto sobre las implicaciones de la destrucci\u00f3n continua de los recursos forestales, como sobre el potencial que tienen tales recursos para contribuir tanto al desarrollo rural como al desarrollo nacional en general. Mrs. Millicent M. FEIWICK (United States of America): I am very anxious to speak to this. as , indeed I have very often before. I think FAO has taken the absolutely correct approach because it is true that we must preserve the environment. It is also true that that is not just some hobby of a few inte lligent people--it is an absolute n ecessity for the world. However, FAO has done it in such a good way because they have taken into account the fact that people live near and around these forests. Therefore, you have somehow to make it possible for them to understand that there is going to be something in it for them, with the planting of fruit trees and other trees that are going to be useful to them and for the preservation of the forest themselves. These points have been emphasized with respect for the local people and their needs and their feelings. As I say, it is not just some hobby of people who want something interesting to be involved in. It is an absolutely essential part of living in this world, not just from the point of view of the environment, erosion and all the things we understand, but the plants-about 80 percent of all the plants that are. interesting are going to be in the tropical or semi-tropical forests of this world. I have also just learned from my friend from Colombia that there is a forest in Colombia which is being very well protected by the government They are buying up the land around it, and there is a small lake there. All the moths in Canada and the United States go there every year as an outing. They wind up in Colombia, very happy and protected. They have just discovered this. We do not like to say I am very happy that 7 percent of the budget of FAO is in forestry, and if it could be increased by perhaps some savings in another area I think it would be to the long-term good of the planet. -376- Milan KARIC (Yugoslavia): I should like to thank Mr Rodas for his very clear presentation and to say that Yugoslavia finds the report of the 8th Session of the Committee on Forestry a very useful document. It provides the policies that should be addressed. We think that the current state of forestry in some regions is critical, and we agree that forest conservation should be included in the regular agenda at sessions of the Committee during the the present decade, and as soon as feasible. We support FAO's Tropical Forestry Action Plan as a framework for harmonizing international action. In this connection, we agree that FAO should play the central coordinating role in the implementation of this plan. As the present situation shows, the capacity of forest industries in developing countries has not been fully utilized. Therefore, we think that FAO and the international direct their efforts to rehabilitating assist developing countries in their efforts. In the area of forest industries, we support among others the recommendation that greater attention should be paid to increase export markets of developed countries. In regard to the state of forestry in Yugoslavia, unfortunately it is not satisfactory as much of the forest is strongly affected by air pollution. This problem is of great concern to us, and the Yugoslav authorities have elaborated an methodology other countries in assessing the real situation, and have elaborated an action plan on how to face and fight the degradation of the forests by air and water pollution which, among other problems, is one of the major problems of almost all European countries. Therefore, at the end of my statement I should like to stress that Yugoslavia expects a close cooperation with FAO and other countries affected by air and water pollution. Mohd. Mazlan BIN JUSOH (Malaysia): First, let me congratulate Mr. Flores Rodas for his very clear introduction to this subject. We the vital role that forests can play both as a source of foreign exchange as well as for the social and economic well-being of a nation. On the matter of international trade in forest products, we would like to echo the concern expressed in the report on the measures to liberalize trade which still exist in the form of direct tariff and non-tariff barriers. Very few people in the government and the public realize the importance of forests in ensuring the conservation of the environment and its contribution to the economy of the country. We are therefore agreeable to the strategy as contained in the report which suggests the use of important personalities in heightening public awareness of the vital role forest. organizations and local voluntary also be mobilized to help in establishing effective communications with the public and political leaders. On the matter of forest conservation, countries should easily be over-exploited, leading to degradation of the soil and the environment. The figures quoted with regard to the state of degradation and deforestation of 11 million hectares per annum by FAO and UNDP is very alarming indeed. be implement forest the Tropical Forestry Action Plan, Malaysia voiced strong support for the said plan in the COFO meeting and wishes to reiterate our stand here. We also agree to the proposed establishment of a working party aimed at mobilizing resources to finance the plan. -377- On the role of forestry in food security, the recommendation that FAO increases its work in the area of agro-forestry systems appears logical to us. Forestry, farming and livestock production are linked viewed as conflicting; rather they should be taken as an integrated wise land use management concept. Joint systems such as forest pastures in food production can ensure environmental Communities living on the fringes of forests agriculture, livestock, as well on forest products including In opinion, the Committee on Forestry will constitute a milestone in the history of the Committee in that besides its other important conclusions this very session endorsed the Tropical Forestry Action Plan as a sound framework and guidance for future forestry activities of national governments, the FAO and other international organizations. My delegation wishes to praise the effective work of the forestry department of FAO that has been devoted for several years now to the preparation of this action plan. We earnestly hope that the plan will be given the political and financial support which it deserves by donor and recipient governments. To this end, I wish to refer to paragraph 68 of the report where mention is made of increased financial resources needed for the implementation of the programme. As the coordinating role of FAO in the implementation of the TFAP will be an important one, it is unfortunate to experience the present financial difficulties which may not allow for the implementation of the programme. As the coordinating role of FAO in the implementation of the TFAP will be an important one, it is unfortunate to experience the present financial difficulties which may not allow for allocating increased levels of funds to its programmes forestry. at this point emphasize the fact that TFAP should be regarded setting and for operational arrangements of the programmes. In fact, the programme is so unique with its structure that it foresees linking FAO with national institutions the recipient as well as in the to financial organizations-a mechanism which in harmonized manner. We therefore reiterate the hope that despite the financial difficulties, the financial requirements of the TFAP will be adequately met by the donor community. Let me now turn to other sections of the report and offer some brief comments on them. As for forest industries, we are particularly glad to see that the Committee supported the concep t of the holistic approach in establishing forest industries. In particular, we would like to stress the social content of this approach aiming at contributing to the rural development by providing new employment possibilities to the people living in forest areas. Not only will the small-scale forest-based industries provide direct employment to the people in these rural areas, but they will also contribute to the expansion of those economic activities serving the forest industry, thus providing additional income families. The role of forestry in improving the nutritional status of people is not limited to the contribution of forest industries in this regard. I recall chat the strong linkage between forestry and food security was best illustrated by the late Prime Minister of India, Mrs Gandhi, during the 21st FAO Conference by referring to a saying: I quote \"Food will last so long as forests do. \" We are gratified so see that this relationship was further elaborated by the committee on its various aspects. In this connection, permit me to point out that this relationship should go beyond our general acceptance and recogn ition be regarded as a guiding principle in formulating policies for forest development in general, and in particular for agricultural development. It is encouraging to note that the past conflict between agriculture and forestry planners is coming to end, even though some conservative views are still in existence in the policy-making circles. believe that the future development policies should incorporate forests into the overall land use planning exercise as a resource interacting with other productive resources, in the attainment of a sustainable social and economic development. Taken in this way, we believe that even the issue of forest protection and conservation can also wish briefly to refer two recommendations of the committee to FAO on forest conservation to which we accord relatively high importance. The first recommendation relates to the updating of information on tropical deforestation and on damage to forest by fires, air pollution, pests and disease. The updated doubt serve various purposes. A bove all, they will be valuable source of information which foresters and policy makers can use to raise awareness among the severity of forest losses, and environmental degradation, and about the responsibilities of the public in preventing these losses. The second recommendation on forest conservation, which we believe is of particular importance, is contained in sub paragraph (vii) of paragraph 45, and it deals with the encourage the PAC) to itensify its activities in this area and we look forward to benefiting from them in the future design of our efficiency programme. The role of forests to maintain an ecological balance and the use of it for the production of timber and wood for various regions and its role in food security is absolutely vital. The April 1985 meeting of the Committee on Food Security stressed the very important role forests can play in their contribution to food security. The role of the forests becomes more obvious when you see the real dangers of deforestation. Therefore, we must support the proposal that we allow forestry industries to recover and we also outlets for various forestry producs, because we are convinced that it they have a guaranteed market that is really the cornerstone for the development of production of such products. The international community has an important role to in the development of forests particularly be developed only if there is an awareness on the part of public opinion, particularly-those populations who are in direct contact with forests. They must realize the importance of these forests for the well-being of mankind. The forest has to be taken as part and parcel and as a component in agricultural development. For these reasons we certainly support the proposals made in this Report regarding national programmes for raising consciousness and we also feel there has to be a link between extension in agricultural and forestry areas. We also feel that there has to be a financial fund for publicity exercises. We would also like to give our full support to the Plan of Action on Tropical Forestry put forward by the FAO and would like to avail ourselves of the opportunity to inquire how much funding been mobilized for that purpose, particularly regarding extra-budgetary contributions. What is the state of at the et \u00e0 votre recommandation, notre dans pr\u00e9servation sa dixi\u00e8me just produit. La internationale prise conscience, par l'opinion publique, et particuli\u00e8rement celle des populations en contact direct avec les au plein appui au plan tropical b\u00e9n\u00e9voles extrabudg\u00e9taires. Ms. Anne-Lise PETERSEN (Denmark): First of all, I wish to thank the Secretariat for the introduction of the Report on the deliberations of the Committee on Forestry which my government can generally endorse. We have noted that the Committee has stressed for improving awareness importance human welfare. We strongly support the Report's viewpoint on this also agree that aspects are becoming more important. Likewise, we have noted that the Committee, in the light of the growing stringency in the of Forestry Action Plan is supported by my government and we hope that this Pl an will suppl y a framework for harmonising international action in this important area. We agree that FAO should play a central role in the implementation of the Plan. In this connection we find that FAO especially should assist in the education and the training of national personnel so that they can play an active role in the implementation of the Action Plan. Concerning the financing of the necessary support of the TFAP we agree with the Committee that so far the Regular Programme resources are insufficient and FAO should ont les publique en faveur de la for\u00eat. L'ann\u00e9e internationale de for\u00eat, objectif.

Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes the Report on the Eighth Session of the Committee on Forestry. We particularly share the view that forests, within the framework of national economies, can make important contributions to development, to the solution of labour market problems, and to the strengthening of the foreign exchange earnings. The recommendation of the Committee to promote the production and marketing of non-wood forest products is also, in our opinion, a promising additional opportunity to stimulate forest development, as mentioned in paragraph 16. The periodic review of forest conservation is also of real concern to us. We particularly welcome the statements in paragraph 45 (i) concerning the problem of tropical deforestation; and (iii) concerning close cooperation with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe with the aim of minimising the negative effects of air and water pollution to protect the forests. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany welcomes the establishment of the Tropical Forestry Action Plan. We feel FAO should play the central coordinating role in its implementation as is shown in paragraph 61, and propose that this coordination be carried out a broad participation of all agencies involved in the implementation of the Action Plan. From the very outset, and particularly at the beginning of November this year, we have taken an active part in the implementation of the Tropical Forestry Action Plan. We invited the group of forestry experts of the donor community to hold their third meeting in Berlin with the aim of harmonising the approach and financing the country evaluation missions -381- We fully endorse the statements in paragraph 66 which states that the responsibility for the increasing awareness of the countries we also support what is said in paragraphs 69 and 70. We also consider it necessary to increase the forestry activities of FAO within the framework of the resources available. In this connection we recommend FAO programme however endorse the Austrian proposal for the establishment of a World Forest Fund. It is our opinion that suitable financing instruments are already available and in this respect we welcome the statements in paragraph 71 of the document. We approve the statements in paragraph 88 of the document. We propose to decide on the question relating to the country hosting the next World Forestry Congress at one of the next Council's sessions with a view to giving the host country sufficient time for preparations. Finally, we would like to support strongly the suggestions of the French delegation that the forthcoming Conference of FAO, . in November 1987, should have an in-depth discussion on the findings of the SILVA Conference held in Paris last February. Almir F. de S\u00e1 BARBUDA (Brazil): My delegation wishes to re iterate its support to the Report of the 8th Session of the Committee on Forestry, a specially important session to the tropical countries. The 8th Session endorses the Tropical Forestry Action Plan, very important initiative that already counted actual already supported international and bilateral action. The delegation of Brazil was very active during the debates of that session, presented its report to the TFAP and stressed, as indicated at paragraph 62, that the preparation of national programmes and ranking of priorities for implementation the exclusive of the governments We pointed out as well that the Tropical Forestry Action Plan must be adapted to the national forestry policies and that account the present financial crisis faced by this Organization, we do hope that the donor community will be generous in regard to the extra-budgetary resources needed for the implementation in the interests of countries involved. On the other hand, we noted with concern that among the adjustments that in the 1986-87 programme of work proposed by the Director-General in document CL 90/23 and already approved is the cooperation that was going to be established between FAO and the International Timber Trade Organization, a newly established organization which went into actual operation the first semester of 1987. Taking into account the consensus needed for the approval en bloc for the adjustment proposed in order to help to overcome the most immediate financial difficulties. My delegation refrained from raising this particular concession at that point. We do hope, however, that as soon as possible an effective relationship and cooperation will be developed between these two organizations. In the longer term this relationship will prove to be the more rational and economical way to avoid duplication of activities under the Tropical Forest Action Plan and specific activities that determine the establishment of the other organizations. Finally, my delegation would as well like the Secretariat to inform us if, after the 8th Session held last April, if any action has been taken in relation to the Austrian proposal mentioned at paragraph 74 of the report for the establishment of a World Forest Fund. We would like to learn if any consultation has been made and which countries have been approached and as well to which session of the Council the Secretariat plans to submit the report requested by the Committee on Vladimir Bulgarian Czechoslovakian delegations would like to express our understanding and some considerations about the item discussed. We have examined with great care document CL 90/8, 1985, which reflects the work and the d ecisions on the 8th Session of the Committee on Forestry. The document before us is really excellently prepared. The FAO report includes the most important recommendations decisions. It contains also the necessary to be undertaken from the member countries and FAO in the future. In this sense our thanks are addressed to Dr Flores Rodas, the Assistant Director-General, for his concise and very good introduction to his assistants and to the FAO Secretariat for the preparation of the report. Indeed, -382- the document summarized the plans of the practical activities of the Organization in the next few years. We also wish to stress that the report combines many of the suggestions of the delegates which make it more creative and applicable. We wish to support and to underline the conclusions and recommendations, and more exactly those in the part \"heightening political and public awareness of the importance of forests for the paragraphs 19 34, \"Forest conservation\" to 45, and \"Forestry and food security\" paragraphs 46 to 63. During the 8th Session of the Committee on Forestry we concerning the local conditions and so-called agro-forestry system and the production of food, raw materials, etc. In this connection, I would like to present you one particular example from the practice of my country which pays a great attention to the importance of the afforestation. Thirty years ago, near to Sofia, the biggest dam in the country was constructed. The main object was to supply the capital regularly with more water, industrial and irrigation purposes included. According to a very precise study and estimations, technical, biological, etc. , the dam is going to during fifty Thanks highly qualified domestic and foreign experts show now that the dam will be used for more than 200 years. Some of the FAO officials know this dam. Our specialists are ready to share their experience in this field. The problem of the afforestation and re-afforestation has a global and exclusively important role for the preservation of the equilibrium between oxygen production and carbon dioxide fixation. Because, as you are undoubtedly aware, the contemporary increase of the carbon dioxide in the air, up to 0. 2 percent, is becoming very dangerous. According to the opinion of prominent scientists from different countries, if this process continues, due life engines, explosion, etc. , including mankind the future will be exposed to the catastrophic situation. So that ail activities of the FAO, as well as the member countries, have to be focused, not only to preserve, but also to increase, the main natural and even artificially created sources of by practically means, to increase the area of the forestry, area under cultivation, pasture, etc. I am convinced that the mutual collaboration of the countries ail over the world and the increasingly important role of FAO as a Special Agency of the United Nations, directly involved in these humanitarian activities, and other institutions, will solve the problem for the benefit of our generation and the next generations. John R. GOLDSACK (United Kingdom): We collection, evaluation and dissemination of information related to forest resources and research development. Member countries which are also concerned with the International Tropical Timber Organization should encourage a similar approach by that organization to effective collaboration with FAO and the avoidance of wasteful duplication efforts in such fields where and experienced. We endorse the Committee's encouragement at paragraphs 18 and 62 of cooperation between FAO and other UN Agencies and recommend that this be vigorously extended to ensure efficient coordination of action by FAO and the International Timber Organization to avoid wasteful duplication. Referring to paragraphs 35 and 74, we would not support the establishment of a World Forest Fund and would recommend the Tropical Forestry Action Plan as the most appropriate basis on which to secure investment in the forestry sector using existing channels for international assistance from multilateral and bilateral resources, in accordance with individual countries' perception of their needs and priority. With regards to paragraphs 60 and 61, the United Kingdom Government supports the Tropical Forestry Action Plan as a logical and coherent framework for harmonized international action and as an aid to reviewing priorities for assistance in economic development In Kingdom supports the proposal of the delegate of France that the r ecent SILVA Conference should be followed up by FAO. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Como la brevedad es lo que se impone en esta \u00faltima parte de nuestra sesi\u00f3n de hoy yo no voy a ser la que desluzca y por esa raz\u00f3n me voy a referir muy brevemente, d\u00e1ndole apoyo a este Comit\u00e9 y mis congratulaciones al Dr. Flores Rodas por el excelente documento que ha presentado para nuestra consideraci\u00f3n. Voy a referirme concretamente al apoyo que debemos darle al Plan de Acci\u00f3n Forestal de los llamados Tr\u00f3picos, que en realidad es de la regi\u00f3n intertropical porque si nosotros vamos a poner solamente \"a los tr\u00f3picos\", vamos a dejar a todo el sector ecuatorial hu\u00e9rfano de protecci\u00f3n. Es la u ltima esperanza para la humanidad y ah\u00ed est\u00e1n precisamente centrados los recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos hacia los cuales miran hoy los pa\u00edses superindustrializados buscando la posibilidad de retenerlos y buscando tambi\u00e9n la posibilidad d conservar los germoplasmas que tanta falta hacen para la continuidad de nuestra vegetaci\u00f3n en el planeta. Pero as muy importante apoyar a la FAO en el Programa de Conservaci\u00f3n, en el criterio de conservaci\u00f3n que nos parece que es realmente lo mis indispensable en este campo. Los bosques est\u00e1n amenazados constantemente y tienen depredadores muy poderosos e importantes. Entre ellos tenemos a las grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas urbanizadoras en los pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo, a los se\u00f1ores industriales, que, aun con el pretexto de industrias agroforestales, contribuyen a desforestar grandes extensiones precisamente en los pa\u00edses, en las \u00e1reas intertropicales, y tambi\u00e9n, por qu\u00e9 no, a los ingenieros constructores de grandes carreteras, autopistas y aeropuertos, que se llevan una buena parte de las superficies de estos pa\u00edses, que antes eran cubiertas de bosques y que ahora quedan cubiertas de asfalto o de cemento. Esto es parte de la tragedia que viven los pa\u00edses llamados en v\u00edas de desarrollo con relaci\u00f3n a la cubierta de bosques en sus territorios, y esto deber\u00edan ser medidas que deben estar tomadas muy en cuenta para la permanencia del bosque. El proceso de aforestaci\u00f3n y de protecci\u00f3n de los bosques, que est\u00e1 planteado aqu\u00ed en el documento, merece todo nuestro apoyo, y solamente nos falta pedir un favor o hacer un ruego a los traductores al espa\u00f1ol de FAO en favor de los lectores cultos de habla espa\u00f1ola, sobre todo de los latinoamericanos, para quienes la palabra \"forest\" (en ingl\u00e9s) no es \"montes\", es \"bosque\". Algunos de los int\u00e9rpretes han traducido correctamente la palabra, pero, en general, empezando porque se llama este Comit\u00e9 de Montes...entonces yo le rogar\u00eda, que, en aras de la verdad y en favor de los pobres latinoamericanos, nos pongan la palabra como es y lo llamen Comit\u00e9 de Bosques y traduzcan la palabra forest por bosques y no por montes, que es perfectamente otra cosa en nuestro idioma cuando se refiere a la vegetaci\u00f3n. Yo no les explico qu\u00e9 es porque me har\u00eda fastidiosa, pero hasta aqu\u00ed llega mi apoyo ai Programa y le doy las gracias ai Sr. Presidente por darme la palabra. Allele ELHADJ HABIBOU (Niger): Au stade de ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation remercier notre toute particuli\u00e8re. Dans la zone sah\u00e9lienne qui est la notre, la d\u00e9sertification est un qui du Sahel se sont retrouv\u00e9s \u00e0 Nouakchott en Mauritanie tenu du 21 au 24 mai 1984 un d\u00e9bat national sur le probl\u00e8me de la d\u00e9sertification. Les participants sont venus de participants de divers pays, ainsi que des organisations internationales et non gouvernementales ont pris part \u00e0 ce sensibilisation des populations a de l'importance et un plan national de lutte contre la d\u00e9sertification a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9; ce fruit d'une coop\u00e9ration fructueuse entre le Gouvernement du Niger, le CILSS et le Club du Sahel. -384- Le plan d'action foresti\u00e8re tropicale dont il est d\u00e9battons vient pr\u00e9vus au plan et cela pour le bien-\u00eatre de nos populations rurales. Le concours de la FAO et des pays amis sera d\u00e9terminant pour l'\u00e9laboration du programme et point tr\u00e8s important sensibilisation essentiel sa politique, car l\u00e9 cadre de la concertation participation sont de politique De la la s\u00e9cheresse et la et je voudrais, sur ce point, appuyer ce qu'ont dit le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la France ainsi que le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de l'Allemagne, sur le fait que ce que nous sommes en train de dire sur l'arbre, la the delegation of Lebanon wishes to confirm its full s upport to the report of the 8th session of the Committee. In our view COFO made outstanding contribution broaden of forestry in the of fundamental importance the fact underlined by that the Tropical Forestry Plan emphasized the relationship of forest lands and forestry with the most crucial development issues--that is, agriculture and food security, rural and industrial development, energy supply and environmental stability. We also development and peoples' participation are seen in the plan as key elements of success. Concerning the technical content, I would like to recall that the plan covers a variety of forest lands and ecological conditions ranging from the humid from coastal formations as the mangroves to the mountain watersheds. The delegation of Lebanon has examined with special care and welcomes particularly those parts of the plan that deal with the problem of desertification, with arid zone forestry, with watershed management and with the protection of endangered plant and animal species as being country's situation. fully share the Committee's view that the contents of the plan are not to be seen in isolation but as an integrated whole which can be translated into national plans, programmes and important decisions to ensure that the Forestry Department and the Organization as a whole take leadership in facing that challenge posed by the implementatioan of the plan and in realizing the promise that the plan offers. With the focus and opportunity offered by the Tropical Forestry Action Plan the programmes of work of the Organization in the field of forestry can respond even more effectively to the true ecological, economic, political and social dimensions of forestry development so clearly identified in members to extend to them as well as to the Tropical Forestry Action Plan their full endorsement and support. -385- Finally, I would like to cake this opportunity to thank FAO for the valuable assistance which it is rendering to Lebanon and rehabilitating its cedar forests. These forests for constructing houses, palaces, ago, have almost become extinct nowadays. We FAO for its efforts revive these forests, establish protected national parks and maintain the existence of this important and valuable tree. Sra. Margarita LIZARRAGA (Mexico): La delegaci\u00f3n mexicana congruente con su inter\u00e9s y participaci\u00f3n en las actividades forestales, acoge con satisfacci\u00f3n el informe y recomendaciones del octavo per\u00edodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Bosques y felicita ai doctor Flores Roda por su excelente presentaci\u00f3n. Consideramos muy acertada la selecci\u00f3n de ios temas que se someten a la atenci\u00f3n de este Consejo y le damos todo nuestro apoyo, pues consideramos que la salvaguarda y desarrollo de los recursos forestales est\u00e1n ligados a todas nuestras actividades, no s\u00f3lo b\u00e1sicas sino vitales por su papel de regulador clim\u00e1tico, por ser un factor b\u00e1sico en evitar ios procesos de desertificaci\u00f3n, por contribuir a la sanidad ambiental, por ser utilizado en el medio rural como le\u00f1a para la preparaci\u00f3n de ios alimentos y como energ\u00e9tico, y por su funci\u00f3n como base de industrias a escalas diversas. Por todo ello, se\u00f1or Presidente, la explotaci\u00f3n debe ser planificada y manejada t\u00e9cnicamente y el comercio revisado en un marco justo y adecuado. Consideramos que la FAO debe reforzar su papel conforme el Comit\u00e9 lo propone. Damos, pues, todo nuestro apoyo al Plan de Acci\u00f3n Forestal en los tr\u00f3picos de la FAO, esperando que conforme a lo propuesto por Austria, y en base a la respuesta positiva de la reuni\u00f3n oficiosa de los expertos forestales en los pa\u00edses donantes celebrada en abril pasado en esta ciudad, puedan incrementarse ios esfuerzos y recursos financieros tanto bilaterales como multilaterales y a trav\u00e9s de la FAO, de acuerdo a las prioridades definidas en los p\u00e1rrafos 76, 79, 81, 83 y 85 del Informe. Apoyamos las medidas recomendadas por el Comit\u00e9 para impulsar y fortal ecer las industrias forestales, particularmente aquellas medidas que fuerzan el programa de FAO para el acopio, evaluaci\u00f3n y difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n sobre recursos forestales y su desarrollo: explotaci\u00f3n forestal, desarrollo tecnol\u00f3gico, productos, mercadeo e inversiones, as\u00ed como el impacto cultural y ambiental de las actividades forestales. Esperamos que la FAO ponga mayor \u00e9nfasis en el mejoramiento de la producci\u00f3n, elaboraci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de productos forestales distintos de la madera a fin de aprovechar las especies que actualmente quedan sin utilizar en los bosques. En este sentido deben impulsar las actividades que reduzcan al m\u00ednimo ios da\u00f1os causados al medio ambiente y a la conservaci\u00f3n de ios bosques a trav\u00e9s de programas de reforestaci\u00f3n. Las medidas recomendadas en el p\u00e1rrafo 45 del Informe, deber\u00edan iniciarse cuanto antes. Enfatizamos la urgencia de que ios pa\u00edses europeos as\u00ed como los de Norte Am\u00e9rica eliminen las barreras prot eccionistas que impiden o limitan dr\u00e1sticamente la exportaci\u00f3n de los productos forestales elaborados en las regiones Latinoamericanas. Asimismo, debe ampliarse el financiamiento exterior a las actividades forestales con Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. Nuestra regi\u00f3n ha recibido un presupuesto menor y un escaso numero de proyectos, aun cuando en esta regi\u00f3n se encuentran ios mayores recursos forestales tropicales del mundo. La FAO debe corregir esta tendencia. En este entendido apoyamos ios objetivos y programas de la FAO en el mediano y largo plazo. Finalmente nuestra delegaci\u00f3n desea agradecer muy atentamente a nombre del pueblo y del Gobierno de M\u00e9xico el reconocimiento hecho en el Comit\u00e9 a nuestro pa\u00eds en ocasi\u00f3n del an\u00e1lisis del Manifiesto de M\u00e9xico por la organizaci\u00f3n y celebraci\u00f3n del Noveno Congreso Forestal Mundial. -386- Shamsur RAHMAN (Bangladesh): My delegacion thanks Dr. the delegation that is of a pre-investment nature-frequently leading to investment projects. In 1985 one forestry project was proposed by FAO for Bangladesh under the Investment Support Programme. The role that forest industries sector plays in a national economy has been described and quantified in many FAO publications. The fact that the importance of forestry should not be limited technical forestry but should take into consideration the environmental, economic, social and cultural context of the country, has also been emphasized in FAO publications. FAO efforts in structuring forestry field programmes, in support of national objectives of development in general, and rural development in particular, is also appreciated. My delegation appreciates FAO's role either into agricultural use or for shrimp culture. Information of the adverse nature of such practices is not plentiful. Also not much research work has been undertaken in this regard by developing countries. My delegation feels that FAO can provide leadership in this field a research project, formulation successful implementation. large scale infestation of loranthus has been noticed. Control of the is essential to save valuable teak plantations. This situation may not be unique to are other countries which are facing similar\" problems affecting their national economy. In the light of this it may be worthwhile for FAO to give serious consideration to the possibility of undertaking a project so as to help the affected countries to face the situation. Hermann REDL (Austria): First of all I should like to thank Dr Flores Rodas for the introduction to the report of the Eighth session of the Committee on Forestry. Document CL 90/8 us Austria welcomes FAO's contribution to the International Year of the Forest in 1985, namely to publish a worldwide estimate of the forestry resources in 1980. As you know, according to this study in 1980 an area of 4. 32 billion hectares was covered by forests. The share in Europe amounting to only 160 million hectares. In the developing countries the conversion from forest land to farm land has accelerated in recent years. A respective inventory of the tropical forest stands shows an annual decline in forest areas of 11 million hectares, mainly for agricultural purposes. One of the objectives of forestry must therefore be the increase in food production by protecting hard water regions, fighting erosion and improving the micro-climate in arid zones, by growing and screens. The biomass of the forests contains a number of edible products which together with the forest fauna, if carefully managed, may assist in raising food production. I should like to refer to the fact that the demand for fuel wood is the highest demand for forest products in the developing countries. As you know in those countries two billion people rely on wood to meet their energy requirements. The employment prospects are of particular importance in forestry, mainly for young people. The development of forest industries should not only be adequate in the technical sense but should be geared to the local conditions. The future activities the Forestry Committee and the Forestry Department should also be seen in the light of the Manifesto of Mexico and the subsequent discussions. In this context, I should like to refer to the discussions at the -387- eighty-eighth Session of the FAO Council and at the Fifteenth Regional Conference for Europe concerning the conservation of forest resources. The Austrian delegation advocates the pertinent initiatives of the Director-General and joins those who plead for an increase in the b udgetary means of the Forestry Department. particular, FAO's field activities should be strengthened. FAO should play an active part in the fight against the decline of forests and include concrete proposals in its Programme of Work for 1988/89. Michael J. RYAN (Australia): I should like to make a brief comment on a particular matter arising in paragraph 45 of the document, where a number of recommendations of the Committee on related in the establishment of seed banks;\". Members of the Council will be aware of Australia's long-standing concern to avoid duplication between the FAO Commission on Plant Genetic Resources of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (a CGIAR Centre) and to ensure that the role of the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources is maintained. Given this concern on our part we would not wish this particular recommendation to be interpreted as an avenue whereby FAO can exert influence over the current activities of IBPGR, nor as a green-light for FAO to increase its activities which could result in duplication of effort in this area. On this subject we would point out that some 50 percent of the total effort on plant genetic effort. Furthermore, we understand (and I am sure that FAO is aware) that the technical advisory group of CGIAR is currently resource activities within the CGIAR system. An additional factor here is that CGIAR is paying increasing attention to the role conservation. Several years ago a detailed programme and management review of IBPGR led to decisions by CGIAR that the Board needed to be more autonomous of FAO. To date, progress along this road has been rather slow. Consequently, Australia has reservations about the implications of COFO and believes that consideration by Council should be deferred for the time being the current of views (Afghanistan): My delegation has gone through the report of the document, which is a useful report and result. Due to the shortage of time I will give a very short comment in regard to the report of the Eighth session of the Committee on Forestry, and this document. Referring to paragraph 11, the Afghan delegation believes that FAO play an important role in the formulating and implementation of small scale projects in the forestry development projects with the cooperation of FAO. Of course, to equip the forestry projects and training of the local personnel in different aspects of forestry would should be given particularly to the security of forest wild life. This point is missing in the document. Also this is a main economic source of the forests. I hope it will be considered in future. Concerning paragraph 20, the Afghan delegation appreciates all types of in drawing public attention to the importance of forestry development in community development, and the preservation of the environment. In the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan \"Tree Planting Day\" is the first day of the Afghan year and is celebrated as a big farmers' festival with special ceremonies. This contributes to the important role of public awareness in forestry development. On that day thousands of different kinds of plants are distributed to the and thousands of endorse the conclusions of the Committee, and we would like to spotlight the following points. We believe that since the protection and production management of tropical forests is vital to the protection of our environment, the need and urgency for improving public awareness of the importance of forests in human welfare is of paramount importance. We would like to emphasize paragraph 25 of the report. We believe that this strengthens the basis for understanding the mutuality of concern about such as Chernobyl and the r ecent Sandoz accident, which are beginning to occur very frequently. We fear that if these kinds of accidents spill over to developing countries, when we are unable to handle the natural hazards which are occurring now, it is easy to imagine what would happen when we were faced with this new type of hazard. Suffice to say that the environment would definitely be affected and perhaps along with that even the people in those countries. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): El se\u00f1or Rodas ha hecho una excelente presentaci\u00f3n. Pensamos que en nuestro informe deberemos incluir la afirmaci\u00f3n del Consejo en el sentido de que los estados del Tercer Mundo no han podido utilizar plenamente su capacidad efectiva de las industrias forestales y apoyar el llamado que el Comit\u00e9 ha hecho a la FAO y a la Comunidad de Donantes para que asistan t\u00e9cnica y economicamente a los estados en desarrollo a fin de que avancen en este campo importante. Adem\u00e1s de las industrias forestales destacamos la funci\u00f3n importante de la ampliaci\u00f3n del comercio y mercadeo y apoyamos a la distinguida colega de M\u00e9xico en el sentido de que este Consejo debe estar de acuerdo con el Comit\u00e9 sobre las conveniencias de eliminar las barreras arancelarias y no arancelarias que han venido entorpeciendo la expansi\u00f3n del comercio forestal. Este Consejo debe sumarse a la opini\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 al reconocer al gobierno de Francia la actitud positiva de haber acogido en Par\u00eds en febrero pasado la Conferencia Internacional sobre el \u00c1rbol y el Bosque, iniciativa francesa que el Gobierno de Colombia destaca complacido y deber\u00eda ser imitada por otros Estados. Queremos igualmente se\u00f1alar el papel importante y positivo que cumple otro pa\u00eds, Austria, cuyo representante el se\u00f1or Redi hace poco nos ha descrito algunas de las actividades austr\u00edacas en ese campo. Nos asociamos al colega de Brasil para preguntar que si ha corrido la iniciativa positiva de Austria sobre el establecimiento del Fondo. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia apoya el p\u00e1rrafo 34 sobre la falta de voluntad pol\u00edtica y el inmenso peso de la deuda externa que han contribuido mucho a que falten adecuadas inversiones en el sector forestal. Apoyamos plenamente el plan de acci\u00f3n forestal en los tr\u00f3picos y la conveniencia de que la FAO y los donantes auspicien el env\u00edo de misiones a los pa\u00edses en desarrollo para asistirles en la ejecuci\u00f3n de sus respectivos planes. A principios de octubre pasado se reuni\u00f3 en Berl\u00edn un grupo de asesores forestales de los pa\u00edses donantes y en esa reuni\u00f3n se concedi\u00f3 atenci\u00f3n sobresaliente a la riqueza forestal colombiana. Entre esos donantes estuvieron particularmente el PNUD, el Banco Mundial, el BID, la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Alemania, Canad\u00e1, la Agencia AID de los Estados Unidos, los Pa\u00edses Bajos y Francia. Esperamos que estos y otros donantes se sumen a la FAO en la misi\u00f3n que pr\u00f3ximamente ser\u00e1 enviada a Colombia para la elaboraci\u00f3n de nuestro plan de acci\u00f3n. forestal. De antemano gracias a todos ellos Una vez m\u00e1s, el Gobierno de Colombia apoya los principios y objetivos del Manifiesto de M\u00e9xico, s\u00edntesis de los buenos \u00e9xitos logrados en el Noveno Congreso Forestal Mundial celebrado en ese hermano pa\u00eds latinoamericano. Apoyamos igualmente a M\u00e9xico en cuanto a la mayor atenci\u00f3n que la FAO debe ofrecer al inmenso potencial forestal de nuestra regi\u00f3n. -389- Finalmente, la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia reitera su pleno apoyo al Departamento de Montes de la FAO dirigida con acierto y competencia por el se\u00f1or Flores Rodas. Mme Anna Teresa FRITTELLI ANNIBALDI (Italie): Il pour la solution des probl\u00e8mes forestiers dans le Mon pays attache une importance \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes. En ce de SILVA, ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation est LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): Solamente para hacer una breve aclaraci\u00f3n; le pido disculpas, se\u00f1or Presidente, por intervenir de nuevo. Me refiero a las opiniones expresadas por una delegaci\u00f3n en relaci\u00f3n a la funci\u00f3n de la conservaci\u00f3n de recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos y el papel que en torno a estas cuestiones tiene el CIRF. Nosotros creemos que \u00e9ste no es un asunto que se deba debatir en este foro; no es \u00e9sta ni la ocasi\u00f3n ni el momento para hacerlo; pensamos que en la comisi\u00f3n de recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos creada al respecto debemos dirimir esas cuestiones. Por tanto, se\u00f1or Presidente, quer\u00eda hacer esta aclaraci\u00f3n para que quede en las actas y que estas cuestiones las tratemos en el foro adecuado. Eiichi KAWAHARA (Japan): The Japanese delegation has no objection to endorsing this report. However, I wish to clarify one point regarding a report to the Council on the financing requirement for action to protect and conserve appears in very much appreciate if the secretary could provide information on how the process of formulating such a report is going, and provide a time schedule for the completion of that report and submission to this Council. In this connection, in the process of compiling such a report, when can we expect the opportunity for any member of the Committee, including (Indonesia): I should like to express my government's support for the work of FAO in the field of forestry. I share the views of other delegations in welco ming and supporting the report of the Committee as set out in document CL 90/8. In supporting this report I should like to underline the importance of forest industries, marketing and trade of forest products and their role in socio-economic development. In this Indonesian government strongly supports the recommendations in paragraphs 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16. In heightening political and public awareness of the importance of forests for the quality of life, my delegation and forestry extension programmes and training and extension for women in the forestry activities. The Indonesian government fully supports the Tropic al Forest Action Plan, in cluding all the Committee's recommendations in the document before us. delegation importance of technical economic implementation I should like to express my delegation's appreciation to Mr Flores Rodas for son \"Directeur pour l'excellent document qu'ils nous ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et surtout en ce qui concerne le Plan de forestier. cette r\u00e9gion du pays n'a pas \u00e9pargn\u00e9e de du pays, sur cette partie de la r\u00e9gion du pays. C'est pour cette le Permettez-nous de Rodas la pr\u00e9sentation claire et concise du sujet. La \u00e0 venir. rele de catalyseur et de chef de file lors de son application dans les ordre d'id\u00e9es, nous renouvelons notre conviction oeuvre dans partageons qu'elle nous a dans la constitution d'un silo national de semences foresti\u00e8res. Pour notre part, nous three issues that have been raised in the course of the debate, each of them being of an institutional character. First of all I would like to warmly welcome the proposal put forward by the representative of France and supported by a number of other speakers, that the FAO Conference would provide an appropriate forum for focusing on the follow-up of the SILVA Conference as well as other similar conferences in the forest area. This certainly seems to be a suggestion that we on the Secretariat can warmly support. I would like to suggest that this process might usefully start at the session of FAO's Committee on Forest Development in the Tropics which is scheduled for September next, a couple of months ahead of the Conference. Secondly, there have been several references in the course of the debate to the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). Only a few days ago the first Executive Director of ITTO, Mr Freezailah, was in FAO for discussions with the Forestry Department and I had the pleasure of a fairly lengthy discussion with him. These discussions have been extremely welcome and supportive. We are agreed on a general principle of complementarity, in other words, there would be no duplica-of activities. They would be able to benefit from the FAO data base and FAO's work and, conversely, we would hopefully be able to benefit from their future activities. The relations between FAO and the ITTO will be worked out through an exchange of letters. Lastly I refer to the comments made by the representative of Australia on one of the recommendations of the Committee on Forestry relating to tree genetics. I agree entirely with the representative of Mexico that this is not the forum at which to enter into any controversy regarding the IBPGR, its role and its relations with FAO. However, I do not believe that any controversy should arise. activities advocated by COFO do anything fundamentally new in the FAO Work Programme. The FAO is cooperating with Australia in this area and is even providing, in the literal sense, seed money to the Australian Organization, known by the initials CSIRO, for the provision of seeds to developing countries. In the second place the IBPGR is not, to the best of my knowledge, engaged in, or envisaging, sponsoring collections of shrubs, mentioned by the representative of Australia, refers to the use of trees in farming systems and not to any plan for the systematic collection and conservation of forest genetic resources. M. A. FLORES RODAS (Subdirector General, Departamento de Montes): Ser\u00e9 muy breve, nada mas quiero referirme a dos puntos: la consulta del distinguido representante del Brasil y otra de sus colegas ac\u00e1 sobre el reporte, sobre el financiamiento internacional que, seg\u00fan lo instruido por COFO, debemos presentar a este Consejo en el futuro. En primer lugar, el estado del trabajo: Se ha contratado ya a los consultores correspondientes para hacer el trabajo; la agenda y su \u00edndice est\u00e1n siendo distribuidos a todos los pa\u00edses miembros de FAO, precisamente a los miembros del Comit\u00e9 Forestal de FAO; y, en tercer lugar, correspondiente a su pregunta, este caso ser\u00e1 presentado al pr\u00f3ximo Consejo de la FAO que creo que es en junio del pr\u00f3ximo ano. En segundo lugar, me quer\u00eda referir, en t\u00e9rminos, generales, al apoyo total de parte del Consejo al Programa de Acci\u00f3n Forestal en los Tr\u00f3picos que ha sido apoyado totalmente, principalmente haciendo \u00e9nfasis en la caracter\u00edstica integral del uso del recurso forestal y no s\u00f3lo el uso del recurso forestal per se, sino la incorporaci\u00f3n de los recursos forestales en general en los programas de desarrollo. Por lo tanto, la participaci\u00f3n de la sociedad, la participaci\u00f3n del hombre, principalmente aquel que vive en la zona rural, es muy importante, ya ha sido reconocido con gran satisfacci\u00f3n de parte de ustedes. Creo que en general estos son mis comentarios. -392- LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie beaucoup M.

In the first Report, which is the Report of the Finance Committee in its Fifty-Seventh Session, the Committee referred to the fact that the host government has agreed to finance the expansion operation in the Headquarters A ccommodation in towards \"Terme di Caracalla\" and it allocated Lire 25 billion in 1986, 1987 and 1988. These facts will be referred to while giving the Report. During the Fifty-Eighth Session, which was held last September, the document before us, which is CL 90/22 was referred to the Finance Committee. This change was put before the Finance Committee and the Committee took note of the new plans and considered that such construction work is part and parcel of the Headquarters Agreement. You will recall that on 19th of November the Council considered certain parts of the Reports of the Finance Committee on financial matters and it left the consideration of the rest of the Reports to today's session. -395- We have before us CL 90/4, which is the Report of the Fifty-Seventh Session of the Finance Committee, which was held in the period between 12-20 May, 1986, and document CL 90/17 which is the Report of the Fifty-Eighth Session of the Finance Committee held in Rome fr om 22nd September to 2nd October 1986. Today the Council considers the Reports of the Finance Committee on the Budget, on personnel matters and on organizational matters in two Reports of the Finance Committee refer to the financial position of the Organization, but the Report of the Fifty-Eighth Session, which is included in document CL 90/17, refers also to the Report of the External Auditor on the Regular Programme, UNDP and the WFP. As regards budgetary matters contained in document CL 90/4, I would like to say that the Finance Committee received a Report en titled \"The Report of the Director-General on the Budget Performance\", and this was only for information until the accounts have been audited. At that time we did not have before us the Report of the External Auditors. The Secretariat informed the Finance various chapters in the budget in 1984 and 1985, and this is referred to in paragraphs 8 and 9 in the first report (document CL 90/4)\u00b7 The Committee reviewed these facts and it took note of the information submitted by the Secretariat of the Organization. As for financial matters which are contained in paragraphs 33 to 40, the Committee reviewed the followed by the Organization of interest to trust funds. It requested a report with additional information to be put before the session to be held in the spring of 1988. This matter will be discussed, and is contained in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the report in document CL 90/4. The Committee also reviewed the actuarial review scheme and a ccepted the proposal submitted by the Organization in this respect. The Committee called for an actuarial review every four years (as was the practice in the past) and for the submission of an interim report in 1988 on this situation. This item is referred to in the report of the Finance Committee in paragraphs 35 to 40 inclusive. Here, the Finance Committee would like to recall to the Council, in particular the recommendation contained in paragraph 38. That is a recommendation which we should particularly like to highlight before the Members of the Council. I now move to personnel matters. The Finance Committee reviewed the 11th Report of the International Civil Service Commission, which is reproduced in Appendix D of the Report of the Finance Committee. This subject is covered in paragraphs 41 to 43 of the Report of the Finance Committee. In this respect, the Finance Committee took note of the resolutions of the General Assembly. Finance Committee also reviewed the changes in salary to Professional and higher categories. This is covered in the Report of the Finance Committee in paragraphs 44 to 47. Paragraph 48 deals with the General Service staff at Headquarters. Paragraph 49 referred to the Pension Developments. here to Organizational Matters. With reference to these organizational matters, we find that the Committee r eceived a report on the progress regarding the construction relating to the He adquarters of the Orga nization. The Committee expressed its the Italian Parliament has approved the financing of this operation by allocating Lire 25 billion for the construction of new buildings at the Headquarters in the Caracalla complex. This is referred to in paragraphs 50 to 58 in the Report of the Finance Committee. Here I should like to recall document CL 90/22 which referred to the operations and expansions which have been finally agreed upon relating to held representative of the host Government and the officials of the Organization which relate to the immunity of the Organization from legal process in Italy. This is covered in paragraph 59 of the Report of the Finance Committee under \"Organization's Immunity from Legal Process in Italy\"\u00b7 Concerning the Joint Inspection Unit, there are several reports which have been put before the Finance Committee and we refer to this fact in our report in paragraphs 60 to 67. The Finance Committee expressed its views regarding the activities of the Joint Inspection Unit. As regards \"Other Matters\", which is the conclusion of the first report of the Finance Committee, in paragraphs 68 to 73 we note that the Committee reviewed the information r eceived from the Secretariat relating to the implementation of the new computer systems for financial information and for personnel matters. They are called FINSYS and PERSYS. The Committee indicated that in its forthcoming session it will review the implementation of this system, and it also expressed the hope that the Organization would benefit from the services provided by these two systems. -396- I should like to refer here to paragraph 72. Under this item in our first report (CL 90/4) we refer to the fact that the Committee was also informed that and supervise this As for paragraphs 74 the reviewed the to the transparency of FAO activities and his readiness to provide all n ecessary information in this respect. As is clear from these paragraphs, the Committee expressed its full endorsement the Director-General's approach regarding the transparency of FAO activities. This has been a summary of our first report-the report: of the 57th Session of the Finance Committee (document CL 90/4) which was held in Rome from 12 to 20 May 1986. I should now like to turn to the report of the 58th Session of the Finance Committee (document CL 90/17). This gives an overall review of the report of the External Auditor and the points of view of the Finance Committee relating to the Regular Programme of the Organization 1984-85, the accounts of UNDP 1984-85 and also financial Information on the WFP for period 1984-85. First, budgetary ma tters: the Committee reviewed the 5th Report on Duty Travel. This includes official travel which had been undertaken during the period 1984-85. This has been covered in paragraphs 3 to 5. These paragraphs also include the points of view of the Finance Committee, since the Committee recognized that the within reasonable limits. As for paragraphs 6 to 9, these cover the Report on the Use of Consultants in 1984-85. Here I should like to refer in particular to the comment of the Finance Committee which is contained in paragraph 9. The Finance Committee also reviewed the Report of the Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Eastern Region of its Distribution Area in South West Asia. This is the budget of the Commissi on which was submitted to the Finance Committee to consider. This covers the period 1985-89. The Fina nce Committee noted that the budget proposed for the Commission is at the same level as for the five preceding years. Having reviewed the b udget, the Committee approved the budget of the Commission. I should now like to move on to the Audited 1984-85 in Rule 77. 7 (i) of the General Rules. Representatives of the External Auditor of the United Kingdom presented to the Committee full reports on the accounts of the Regular Programme, the UNDP and the WFP. As is the usual practice the External Auditor gave his candid views as regards the financial statements of the Regular Programme for 1984-85 which was submitted to him by the Organization. As usual when giving his opinion the External Auditor decided without any reservation that in accordance with his auditing that these financial statements gave a clear and candid picture of the activities and operations of the Organization for the period 1984-85. This is clear in the Report of the External Auditor. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with financial practice and they are in line with the financial statements prepared for the previous financial period, and all the financial Information is in line with the Financial Rules. This is in summary the opinion of the External Auditor contained in his report when he audited and reviewed the Regular Programme activities. The Finance Committee noted that the opinion of the External Auditor regarding the accounts of the Regular Programme of the Organization was given without any reservations or modifications. This is also the case with the financial statements of 1984/85 which were discussed with the External Auditor and with the Secretariat of the Organization. The External Auditor reviewed the situation, and in his report he included a review of the Regular Programme monitoring. This is referred to in paragraphs 47-50 of the Report of the Finance Committee, document CL 90/17. As regards FAO country representatives, this is referred to in paragraphs 51 and 52. Procurement of word processing and data processing equipment is covered in paragraphs 53-56. The Italian Special Contribution, that of the host Government, is covered in paragraph 57 in the Report of the Finance Committee. Then we have the Inland Water Transport project which is covered in paragraphs 58-60. The Finance Committee expressed its satisfaction regarding all these items and the Information contained in the report of the External Auditor. It also expressed its satisfaction in cases where the External Auditor made some recommendation regarding the efforts exerted contained in paragraph 61 of the Report of the Finance Committee. Now I move to the World Food Programme. We discussed with the External Auditor and the Secretariat of the Programme the report of the External Auditor and his review of the World Food Programme in the financial period 1984/85\u00b7 This is covered in paragraphs 62 and 63\u00b7 The World Food Programme's emergency operations in Africa are referred to in paragraph 63\u00b7 The computerized World Food Programme Information System and the views of the Finance Committee are covered in paragraph 64\u00b7 The supply of food aid to a grain surplus country in Asia is referred to in paragraph 65. The assistance given to and views of the Finance Committee regarding these matters. I should like to recall here the recommendation of the Committee that the Council would present to the Conference the audited accounts of the Regular Programme, of the UNDP and of the WFP for the period 1984/85 for approval. It has been the practice that the Council recommends to the Conference that it approve these audited accounts. Paragraph 67 refers to the draft Conference resolution. The draft resolution is submitted to the Council so it may be forwarded to the Conference. The Finance Committee unanimously recommends that the Council and the Conference in approve these audited accounts. The Finance Committee also report submitted by the Secretariat on Trust Funds. The Secretariat submitted a report on Trust Funds on non-application of 13 percent support cost reimbursements. We considered this issue in depth with the Secretariat, and the Committee reviewed the information on the cost measurement system, results for 1985. We took no te of the details contained in these two documents, and the Finance Committee unanimously expressed its satisfaction with the clarifications given by the Organization in response to the queries made in the Finance Committee. Paragraphs 68-73 give full information on \"Appropriations\", Committee approved the am 202 as contained in paragraph 76. Paragraphs 74-76 refer to the amended text of the proposed Financial Rule 202. Now I move to personnel matters. In paragraph 77 of the Report of the Finance Committee you will see that the Committee was informed that the International Civil Service Commission determined the levels for the Rome post adjustment classification as is contained in the table This table refers to the levels by International Commission. Paragraphs 78-80, including the following five tables, give statistics of services. The Finance Committee reviewed this information and approved the information submitted. The Finance Committee called upon the Secretariat of the Organization to continue its efforts after implementing the computerized system as regards personnel matters. The Finance Committee called upon the Secretariat of the Organization to continue its efforts in providing full statistics and upda ted data to be given to the Finance Committee at the next autumn session, that is after the application of the computerized system in personnel matters. In paragraphs 81-83 the Committee considered a proposal the would permit the Director-General to implement decisions the United Nations General Assembly effective 1 January 1986, that is last January. With respect to measures in support of staff with disabled childre n; the Committee recommends and with effect January Paragraph the amended regulation. There is also another subject to which I would like to refer, namely the composition of the UN Joint Staff Pension Board. The Committee considered this subject and it also reviewed the points of view expressed in the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly. We also reviewed the views expressed by the Directors-General and by Staff Pension Board. The Finance Committee approved the recommendations to be put before the Council which are contained in paragraph 85 of the Report of the Finance Committee. There are six recommendations put before the Council for approval, including recommendation (d) relating to an enlargement of the Pension Board size. The view of the Council on the Pension Board size will be submitted to the 37th Session of the Board. Therefore, the Council is called upon to give its recommendations in order that this may be put before the 37th Session of the Pension Board, and the UN General Assembly 42nd Session. -398- Finally, I turn to the organizational matters. This is the conclusion of the second report of the Finance Committee in its 58th Session. Paragraphs 87 to 92 refer to the information considered by the Finance Committee relating to the Headquarters Agreement. We dea lt, in particular, with the privileges and immunities together with the information on Headquarters Accommodation and the situation as regards the reconstruction of the Caracalla complex. We found that the boundaries had been re-defined as necessary for the new construction work. This is contained in letters exchanged between Government, Host Government. This is the Appendix I referred to in document CL 90/22. In September, the Finance Committee was well informed in this respect and of the developments, however, the matter was not complete at the time. I believe that the picture is now clear and we have a document put before the Council for information in this respect. Finally, we considered the reports of the UN Joint Inspection Unit which have been submitted on the progress of the application of the computerised system in personnel matters and the Finance Committee, considered the situation relating to the purchase of FAO Representation in Zimbabwe. The Finance Committee concluded its session on 3 October 1986 and it agreed to ho ld an extra-ordinary session in Rome on 15 and 16 December, in response to the invitation by the Director-General in order to review the financial situation of the Organization and monitoring this situation in view of current developments. The Committee approved to hold the Sixtieth Session of the Fi nance Committee in the period from 4 to 15 Hay 1987. I have put before you, and presented, the two reports of the Finance Committee. I hope that I was clear, and I stand ready, and I also believe that the Secretariat of the Organization stands ready to present any additional Information which you might deem appropriate. LE PRESIDENT: Je and request that my intervention might be split into separate parts. I will speak briefly now and, if you agree, I will take the floor on the organizational matters later in order to give my colleagues an opportunity to intervene on the subject of the Finance Committee, although it has no relevance for their country, because it concerns my country. If you agree, I would, without a prepared text, offer a few comments on the subject raised by the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr Bukhari, whom I thank again because I had reserved, at the beginning of our Session, to take the floor again on this particular point. Therefore, my remarks will relate closely with document CL 90/17. I will start at paragraphs 18 to 20. We, as the Finance Committee, regretted to see that so many countries are still in arrears. We strongly appeal to all Member Nations, outstanding to action\" etc. the aim being to enable the Organization to continue to have the financial liquidity required. I come back to the points of the financial liquidity. I hate the words \"financial crisis\". I do not want to see this word. This will tarnish the image of our Organization. Our Organization is not undergoing a crisis, it is undergoing some transitory financial liquidity problems. In order to help the Organization to survive, and I do not mean survive as an entity, overcome this liquidity and cashflow problems, we had thought of one way of helping, in addition to the measures which our Director-General has already proposed to us, and which we fully endorsed last time. During the meeting of the Finance Committee we had taken the floor more than once on this subject which has been summarized here under paragraph 24. Paragraph 24 touches upon the surpluses which savings, partly income from the investment of the funds on deposit. We underlined last time, as the delegation of Italy, that it is the individual privilege of each nation to renounce or delay the receipts of, their share of the cash surplus which, for the biennium 1984/85 was very high, almost $36 million. As we already know, the Finance Committee, by the information r eceived and the Director-General, do not, unfortunately, forecast any cash surplus in this biennium. At the Italian Government had thought it perhaps expedient to call for an extra-ordinary Conference that might, because the powers are the Conference powers, suspend a certain Financial Regulation. Not cancel and not change, but suspend. Some of the delegates have misunderstood what I said last time, so let me make it clear. I said suspend and not cancel. We understood that there was no consensus on this convening of a Special Conference. Therefore, we had to take the case in our hands and see, as one of the major donors and especially the Host Government, how we could help the Organization to overcome these difficult times. -399- I mentioned last time two items which could represent a modest Italian contribution to the problem. Unfortunately, I did not hear many colleague delegates come out with their dollars and cents. We heard plenty of words, perhaps too many. This is not a criticism, but I was criticised for being too much in love with the Finance Committee. I love the Finance Committee, because I love the Chairman. Therefore, I am pleased that we, in the Finance Committee, are going to receive the ball which is almost as heavy as it was when presented before you, Mr Chairman. The ball is as heavy as before. We have tried to make it a little bit lighter. Today, I am very honoured to announce that my proposal was accepted the surplus. Let me give you the figure, $1 750 000 which is just pure words, for the year 1987 and at least until 1988. In other words, we will send a letter using our prerogative, to the Secretariat, saying that the Italian Government does not want its 1987 contribution reduced by the quota of the cash surplus that pertains to us, in view of the insufficient and unsatisfactory percentage we pay to the Organization. We try to make up for the small percentage which does not satisfy us by other means. The Director-General was kind to say that we have become the prominent donor, even without making a percentage. I do not want the Secretariat to calculate that percentage. In making this announcement I say th at for 1987 Italy will hopefully pay two months in advance of the regular routine payment (end of April). I will put all my strength at the disposal of the Organization so that we can pay the whole amount by the end of February, if not before. You can make the decision as to whether you want good dollars or good lire. However, I do not think it is within the power of the Council or the Finance Committee to decide which currency to use. This will mean that if the problem is postponed until 1988, not earlier than 1988, we might rediscuss whether we want that part deducted from the 1988 contributions or not deducted at all. The ways of God are so many, let us keep all these ways open. I appeal to the major donors (I have had some contacts with them, but privately and not engaging) to consider very strongly the possibility of doing something of this kind. We have to give the Director-General absolute safety against the risk of a cash flow problem. After the statement which we heard from the major contributor we are not any happier. The situation does not look any rosier than before, because by the end of 1987 we cannot count on more than what the largest contributor has promised. We fervently hope there will be a revision of this attitude. I wish to make my intervention a little lighter by recalling what I told the Ambassador of that country. I said \"you were suggesting to us to make a certain march on the Capitol. The original Capitol is not far from here , although, there is another Capitol there . If we march on this Capitol here, the municipality of Rome is in no better position as far as the deficit is concerned. \" (end of joke). After this appeal to the major donors to consider a similar attitude, I would like to say why we are not quite sure that the projections of the Secretariat are correct, because, if I am exact, every fifty lire that the rate of exchange of the dollar loses on the Italian market it would mean a couple of million dollars more in the deficit of the Organization. At the time of the projection when the Finance Committee was in session, we were told that a special reserve account of minus 0. 9 at the end of 1987 would become minus 2. 9, wh ich means $2 million higher if the rate of exchange of the dollar were 1350 instead of 1400. If you follow the fluctuation it was 1380 yesterday. It has never gone beyond 1400 in the last few days. God save us. We do not want the dollar to fall any lower than that but all possibilities are open, even 1300 is not ruled out by some experts, so the cash flow problem might exist even with the Director-General, for $16. 4 millio n, plus taking $9 million from the Working Capital Fund will make it zero. No, it is not enough, we have to give the Organization that, could I say umbrella, and the umbrella is made by these gestures that I am glad to announce today. Further, I have another little point, paragraph 44/45. In paragraph 44/45 of document CL 90/17 we took note in the Committee of the Director-General's position that as the Programme of Work and Budget had been approved by the Conference, he could not make Programme cuts at his discretion. One hundred percent in agreement with the Director-General, this is true, but not even the Council may authorize cuts in the Programme. We do not want cuts in the Programme. We do not want to frustrate the countries that are expecting the programmes to be both the Regular Programme and the Technical Cooperation Programme; we have to do our utmost not to touch anything on the Programme; if anything can be slowed down, yes, but not cut. So cuts must be made elsewhere or we have to find additional resources. The Director-General suggested that we have a Special Session on the 15th and 16th of D ecember. We are ready to face this difficult task of examining the alternative measures for the middle term correction of the difficulties of the Organization, but the short-term cannot, I repeat, cannot be solved by the Finance Committee. I hope that my Chairman agrees. So this is the seat, this is the orga n and beyond the limit of the 49 members of the Council--I met the representative of a couple of countries that do not sit in the Council; the way is open to them, especially if they are major donors, to waive for the time being the reimbursement of the cash surplus and leave it in the hands -400- of the Organization in which we have full confidence because the Organization oust not breed the outside image of a crisis and to talk about having recourse to a loan, to borrow money, although the Director-General is fully authorized to do so, finds us, as many of the countries here, in contrast, because that would mean that the Organization is going to be submerged and we do not want to leave this very very false image. Final point on this intervention, paragraph 71; of course, as a member of the Committee, Italy does not contest what has been approved by the Finance Committee with our concurrence. Nevertheless you have the second sentence this reads \"If this expenditure were excluded there would have been a reduction in the support costs on both programmes. \" So if my mother had been Mrs. Rothschild I would have been a very rich man! But what I would like to say is we want to continue this sentence and we could not do it in the Finance Committee. This is a point that has been raised by many delegations during this Council and it is very important to us because there are millions and millions of dollars that we spend through this Organization as support costs. If I recall what we discussed in the Finance Committee-it is open to everybody to look at the verbatim reports-chat percentage went a little below 12 percent because for 3 year s, 1985, 1986, 1987, these support costs were burdened by the extraordinary cost of the FINSYS/PERSYS contract. Once the contract has been paid in full, I think that this percentage should come, in my own my government's evaluation, below 12 percent. I to would like to express, on behalf of Director-General, our heartfelt thanks to the Government of Italy for the decision which it has now taken to pay in full its assessed contribution for 1987 without deduction of the portion of the cash surplus from the previous biennium and also to advance the payment of its contribution for 1987. This comes as yet another remarkable gesture of support from the Government of Italy which is helping the Organization in so many ways. I venture to hope that the appeal expressed by the representative of Italy to this example will indeed be heeded very seriously so that even if other countries are not yet in a position to announce decisions before the end of the Council session they may perhaps be in a position to do so when the time comes to make their payment of their 1987 contribution. Amin (Germany, Federal Republic of): My delegation has decided this morning that we will refer (in our statement) to both agenda items 11 and 12. 2; even though this means dealing with at least five different documents I will nevertheless try to be as brief as possible. Let me first of all thank the members of the Finance Committee, as well as the Secretariat for the work they have done and the presentation of the documents. As regards documents CL 90/17 we largely share the results expressed in the report of the Finance Committee. We particularly welcome the savings in staff co sts to the amount of US$29. 9 million achieved in the biennium of 1984-1985 as far as those were not due to monetary -401- influences. The transfer of US$15 to the Technical Cooperation Programme, however, led to the building up of a high reserve as at 31st December 1985 under that budget item. reserves under one single budget estimate does not seem to us compatible with the principle of rational and economical use of the scarce funds available. We also believe that a much greater emphasis is placed on the programme through the building up of a reserve of more than 10 percent of the regular budget compared with the other programmes of FAO than had been envisaged by the Member States when setting up the TCP. On the other hand, however, we would also like to express our appreciation to the Secretariat for its budget management which in the biennium 1984-1985 led to a cash surplus of US$ 34. 7 million. In view of the present financial situation we support the Secretariat in continuing its policy of austerity, as reflected in particular in paragraph 25 of document CL 90/4 and paragraph 44 of document CL 90/17. We regret the related documents CL 90/17, CL 90/24 and C 87/5 to 7 reached us so late for our preparation for this Council session. We therefore request the Secretariat to expedite the distribution of such important meetings. the implementation of the Pr ogramme of Work and Budget for 1986-1987 which are inter alia to be attributed to the difficulties as outlined in paragraph 27 of document CL 90/4 and paragraph 20 of document CL 90/17; for example, in the exchange and interest rates. Against this background it seems important to us that all Member States meet their commitments towards the Organization in accordance with the Constitution. Whether, and, if n ecessary, to what extent the Organization has to handle shortfalls of payments in the present biennium is not yet clear in detail in terms of figures. We therefore welcome the fact that the Director- General, in coordination with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, proposed to convene the Finance Committee for a special meeting on the 15th and 16th of December. We can approve the draft resolution under paragraph 67 of document CL 90/17. I will comment on details of auditing later on. With regard to paragraph 73 of this document, we would be grateful for information about the cost borne by the Regular Programme. In the statistics of personnel services, Tables I to IV, we note that the temporary contracts of less than 12 months Including this category on the basis of Table IV, part A, in our calculation we come to a total staff number of 7 962 persons or person/years. This figure does not include short-term general service contracts. We would be grateful to the Secretariat for confirmation of this figure. In paragraph 83, document CL 90/17 we welcome the reached for staff with disabled The formulation contained in staff regula tion 301. 0034: (iii) does in our view, however, not fully comply with the regulation adopted by the UN General Assembly. We propose to amend the staff regulation accordingly. We agree with the statements in paragraph 85 of the document. Let me now refer to documents C 37/5, 6 and 7. We wish to thank the External Auditor for the thorough auditing of accounts. We believe that the External Auditor in parts I-III a great nu mber of suggestio ns and valuable recommendations to the Secretariat and Member States which we welcome. We consider the role played by the External Auditor within the framework of our overall joint activities an extremely positive contribution due to our own positive experience at national level with regard to auditing. We believe that the External Auditor has given us valuable orientation in the Reports available to us which the Secretariat and the governing bodies of the Organization should take to heart. We particularly welcome the table in paragraph 5 of document C 87/5 which shows for the end of the 1984-85 biennium a cash surplus on the General Fund of almost 34. 76 million dollars. I have already expressed our concern about the transfer of a very large budget share under the Technical Cooperation Programme. With regard to paragraph 11 of document C 87/5 we believe that in connection with the unobliged sum of 376 711 dollars for the 1982-83 biennium a printing error has occurred. The transfer of this sum to \"Miscellaneous Income\" was effected in our opinion under Financial Regulation 4. 4, not 4. 3. Financial Regulation 4. 4 only provides that any remaining balances shall be credited to \"Miscellaneous Income\". Financial Regulation 4. 3 does not mention this transfer. Apart from many other positive statements in the External Auditor's we which aims linking more closely existing data processing system, PLANSYS, to FINSYS and PERSYS which are not yet operational. -402- With regard to paragraphs 23 to 39 we feel that for future International tenders still greater importance should be attached to a greater competition of offerers. In document C 87/6 we particularly welcome the decline in staff costs for project implementation in 1985 by 1. 3 percent as shown in the table in paragraph 13\u00b7 We feel that the improvements which the External Auditor suggested in paragraphs 3 to 7 of his Report, document C 87/6, must quickly be put into practice. We particularly believe that there must be clarity as to which equipment belongs to the Inventory of our Organization and which was transferred to the recipient governments concerned. In of income over expenditure set out in paragraph 6. Greater importance has to be attached, as we gather from the External Auditor's Report, paragraph 9, to a greater exchange of information between WFP Headquarters and the agencies in the field. Mohammed CL 90/17)\u00b7 En ce qui concerne le premier document, la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de mener ces activit\u00e9s avec beaucoup Pour l'autre d\u00e9l\u00e9gation tunisienne ce rapport financier, pour le programme ordinaire de m\u00eame que pour le programme des Nations Unies pour le d\u00e9veloppement et le PAM pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode.

James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): With the decision to run items 11 and 12 together this statement will be rather longer than we would have wished and I apologize in advance. To begin with the Finance Committee's Reports, these Reports provide us with a very useful insight into the Organization, its financial systems, its management and its personnel management. We congratulate the Committee and its Chairman on its treatment of complicated and at times even opaque information. We have already raised the question of programme costs and we glad that this important subject will now be considered by the Finance Committee at 1st meeting in May. We have of course ccepted the Secretariat's offer of discussions with our specialist staff and we will be very happy to share our Information with the Finance Committee. So far as other financial issues are concerned, we were a little surprised that the Committee did not appear to pursue some of the issues raised by the External Auditor's Report with greater vigour. We have a number of questions which we will raise in respect of Auditor's comments. The Finance Committee also deals with personnel matters and it is here in particular that we would have welcomed more information and a broader approach by the Committee to personnel issues. At a time when the Organization is under financial pressure we have to be satisfied that it is doing all it can effectively to manage its most important asset, the staff. We understand that many United Nations organizations have a system of regular performance appraisal of staff. Such a procedure obviously has values. It can be used staff development, training and career planning. It also provides the Organization with a picture of individual performance which can provide a useful base for objective promotion procedures. We understand that FAO operates an appraisal system for field staff but that once staff has passed a provisional period in Headquarters there is no other appraisal system, although we understand that one has been under negotiation for some time. In the absence of any information from the Finance Committee's Report we should be grateful for a Secretariat statement covering the following points. There are four points. First, for how long has there been no system of staff appraisal for Headquarters staff; secondly, when are discussions of the of an appraisal system likely to be finalized; thirdly, will the appraisal system be integrated with a programme of staff career development training; fourthly, in the absence of an what used to internal consistency in the promotion question in our view, particularly important since over 60 of FAO vacancies are by internal promotion. have already expressed concern with the style and format. The Financial Statements do not provide an adequate picture of the financial operations of FAO. It is not as the Deputy Director-General would have it, simply a question of transparency. It is, as we have said before, in our view the absence of basic information which we believe that senior management needs if it is to manage the Organization effectively. In an international organization of this nature, we would not normally expect it to be left to the Member States in the governing body to seek out such Information. We would expect senior managers themselves to demand this information from their staff. For example, in an intervention on an earlier item Mr Crowter kindly offered to provide us with additional information. I should be very grateful if we could be given a statement showing the cash balances held-by FAO during the past and cu rrent biennium. This relate s to the 300 million dollars we referred to earlier on FAO's liquidity. We should also be grateful for a similar statement in respect of WFP assets. The cash balance for WFP has not, as far as we can see, been given to us. However, the interest on bank deposits is recorded at 38. 5 million dollars. This figure can be found in paragraph 10 on page 2 of the Financial Statement for WFP. I should also like to repeat my request for a statement of the actual spending by FAO on the Regular Programme in the 1984-85 biennium. When I asked for this earlier, Mr Crowther referred to figures in the statement of expenditure. However, the definition of expenditure, at page 21 of the Financial statement of the Regular Programme, includes \"outstanding all that certain circumstances where one signs a contract one makes a down payment but the final payment may not be due until some time later. -404- It is quite payments will be split across several biennia. It is for this reason we should like a clear statement of how much FAO actually spent in the biennium as distinct from expenditures as defined in the Financial Statement. I ask these questions because same biennium impossible. We would be happy to discuss these issues with the Secretariat when our experts are here to discuss programme delivery costs. Turning to a of comments specific and also because of the implications of the effectiveness of the financial and management systems at FAO. At this point I should like to endorse the comments made by the distinguished delegate of the Federal Republic on the role of the auditor and our thanks for the advice and assistance he gives us all. We were surprised to read in the Auditor's Report on UNDP, of inadequate control of inventories. Two years ago in the Council when we referred to criticism of the way in which FAO failed to follow UNDP procedures, we were reassured by the Director-General that matters had been improved. It now appears that that reply was not comprehensive. We would be interested to learn of the reaction of the circumstances, should the Secretariat that inventory control procedures exist for the Regular Programme and that proper control is exercised in a timely manner by the Secretariat. Another area touched upon by the auditor is project design and control in the Trust Fund Wages Project. Again, we would like to learn from the Secretariat what steps are being taken to improve the standards of project design (in FAO) and control throughout the Organization. The External Auditor's comments on the Regular Programme (paragraph 15 of his report), shows the absence of cost analysis. \"Neither the accounting system nor sufficient activities. \" Given the financial problems faced we would interested whether senior management will modify PERSYS and FINSYS and other systems to provide this system. The auditor's comments on the purchase of word processing equipment raises issues about the implementation and interpretation of FAO's management and financial procedures. It might have been instructive if the Finance Committee could have looked into the issues raised by the auditor in more detail and with greater vigour. The main areas of concern appear to us to relate to an apparent failure to appraise the system before purchase, and the circumstances surrounding the to accept the offer without seeking further bids. In order to provide a fuller picture of the background to this and to help us identify the areas of FAO's management's system which may require to be strengthened, we should be grateful if the Secretariat could provide us with the following additional information: first, was the manufacturer who was awarded the contract one of the three companies identified by the ISRC and referred to in paragraph 24 (iii) of the Auditor's Report. Secondly, although there was no formal technical appraisal of this system, did any informal appraisal take place? Did any member of FAO staff visit the manufacturer to discuss their proposals? We circumst within the previous 18 months. This was clearly not so in this case, as the other manufacturers had not submitted quotations for equipment to be purchased. In those circumstances, can we be informed at what level in FAO was the decision taken to waive competitive tendering, and this decision endorsed? We should also like to know if the comments of the auditor have been formally drawn to the attention of the staff concerned, and there are any proposals to clarify the parts of the Manual to ambiguity in the circumstances in a mandatory requirement. To enable us to appreciate the sequence of events, I should be grateful if the Secretariat could let us have details of the following dates when was the closing date of the original tender? On what date did FAO receive a fully coated specification for the alternative system? At what date did FAO authorize the first purchase order for the alternative system? Finally, we should have preferred that at some point this Council could have continued to focus on the short-term financial situation of the Organization, during the second week. Our discussion under agenda item 12. 1 last week was in the nature of a first reading and was carried out in ignorance of a key fact. Only in the last minutes of the discussion did we learn that the United States would no t be contributing 24. 7 million of its dues for 1986, and will be paying most of what it will be paying some months after the end of the year in question. Had these intentions been known with certainty earlier, representatives could have given advice to the Council. -405- I now read th e wishes of the Council as shown in the Chairman's report Co give further time for an assessment of the actions which need Co be taken, in addition to the economies identified by the Director-General and for that assessment to be taken into consideration by the Finance Committee in D ecember. In view of the closeness of that meeting, and acknowledgment by Members of the Council that the situation is a changing one which requires the Director-General to continue to take action on economies, my delegation can, with some reluctance, accept this procedure. However I would ask two things: acknowledgment that perceptions of the short- term crisis are evolving as reflected in Secondly, that views which do evolve significantly during the this meeting, perhaps during the adoption of the report, so as to give the best possible guidance to Members of the Finance Committee. This sugges tion is made in order to ensure the best and most responsible use of this Council and the time of its Members. Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (Original language Arabic): I should like to thank Mr Atif Bukhari for his very clear and succinct introduction to the report of the 57th and 58th Sessions of the Finance Committee. We have studied these documents carefully and we should like to express our entire satisfaction with them since they have dealt with all financial matters effectively which is ample proof of sound management and deep insight. Milutin TAPAVICKI (Yugoslavia): I should first of all thank Ambassador Bukhari for his very clear presentation of the documents from the last two sessions of the Finance Committee. I do not wish to make any comments concerning the report of the 57th Session. However, I should like to express an opinion in connection with the 58th Session of the Finance Committee on the questions of audited accounts. The Yugoslavian delegation would like to its satisfaction with the due attention and interest given by the Finance Committee in reviewing audited accounts for the FAO Regular World Programme for the biennium 1984-85. . We we lcome the of the review of the accounts. However, at the same time, we are supporting the Committee's conclusions in paragraph 56 (document CL 90/17) regarding the unforeseen development in the establishment of the word and data processing capacity within FAO, mainly due to the rapidly evolving technology in office automation and data processing. The Committee was in a position to note that the remarks of the External Auditor regarding the under-utilization of the barges provided to the government concerned under welcom ed In Government's decision supplement the one-time allocation billion lira for covering the costs of the rental of additional office accommodation, we could not but join the Committee's expressed satisfaction. The World Food Programme was faced by coincidence with more serious problems in the development of its computerized Information system leading to the abandonment of the initial contract of $3 million. This expensive experience indicates the necessity of even greater caution in the choice of computer techniques in the future. The Committee further noted the comments and observations of the External Auditor regarding the World Food Programme's operations. We believe Chat the Committee's rema rks and suggestions will be given reiterated position that whilst possibility that the World Food Programme terminates at the moment of delivery of food aid to the authorities in the country the World Food Programme has the duty of assisting and encouraging the local intended audited accounts submitted by the Committee. -406- Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Dem. Republic of) (Original language Arabic): I should like Co preface my remarks by thanking Ambassador Bukhari, of the Committee, for his very clear introduction to both reports from the Committee. I should also like to thank him for the unstinted efforts that he has devoted to deal with sensitive and serious issues. I should like to express my delegation's support for the recommendations contained in both documents. We would like to commend the Secretariat for their efforts, particularly regarding financial measures, since receipts this year reached their optimal level in years. As regard the financial difficulties facing the Organization, we give our full support to what was said by the Ambassador of Italy, wh o has appealed to all countries to honour their commitments to the Organization and pay their contributions without delay. We should also like to express appreciation to Italy and the distinguished Ambassador of Italy for all the gestures that have been made which lead to a strengthening of the Organization. We thank them for paying the full contribution for 1987 and for what they have done regarding the headquarters premises. We commend the Director-General for the skillful management of this Organization notwithstanding the financial difficulties. We are satisfied that measures have been taken which will strengthen the financial situation of the Organization, even beyond the present biennium. Finally, we are entirely satisfied with budget planning and monitoring which he considered comprehensive and in order. We agree with the draft resolution on the Audited Accounts in paragraph 67 of the Report, calling for their approval. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): We are grateful for your suggestion that we consider these items 11 and 12 together because, as the Chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated in his introduction, they do overlap and similar considerations are given in documents. Initially, we had thought of putting our remarks in two separate parts, but we shall try to work them together. Being a former member of the Finance Committee, it was with some nostalgia that I read these two reports from my present position of exile. One advantage of having been a member of the Committee is the ability to recognize the For the benefit of members who have not enjoyed the privilege of being on the Committee, I can assure them that the deliberations are familiar and not particularly different from those that take place in other committees of the Organization. It is difficult to deal with one of these papers at a time. Therefore I shall try to make reference to the documents as I discuss them. The first issue arising from the Finance Committee that caught our eye was the general question of transparency. This is a rather subjective question and we feel that perhaps we should that the word \"transparency\" is a contemporary one designed in the present context mean the ability to see clearly, particularly by member management of the Organization, how things work and particularly how our money is spent, and as a result to make sound judgements on behalf of our governments. Comments in our meetings on the lack of transparency in some areas by our delegation and others are, I am afraid, too often met in a rather defensive way as if we were accusing the Secretariat of hiding something or witholding. Furthermore, perhaps believing that good offence is the best part of defence, the Secretariat drafts have taken on a rather offensive tone in recent months, as may be seen in paragraphs 68 to 73 of document CL 90/4, and even more in document CL 90/3 when we get to that item later in our agenda. If these thrusts are designed to inhibit member management from questioning a process or to bring discredit to those who do so, then we think it is a poor example for the multilateral system, particularly at a time when greater efficiency and effectiveness are sought and need to be seen to be demonstrated in order to build the necessary confidence in the system. That having been said, we would like to thank the Secretariat for its partial response to our queries over the last couple of years on transparency, and that has to do particularly with the questions regarding staffing matters and the accounting for funds in the Technical Cooperation Programme. The charts on pages 16-22 of document CL 90/17, giving us statistics of personnel services, are to be welcomed. In due course we would like to see somewhat more in this respect, notably an organization-wide establishment chart replete with position numbers in place which would be augmented from time to time, perhaps quarterly, by an issued list of job numbers that are vacant. We should also like to have a somewhat better accounting on a historical basis of employees to Technical Cooperation Programme, we pleased that not carried over from biennia to biennia as free-floating cash. The tables provided in the annexes to the auditor's report in document C 87/5 shed additional light on these subjects. However, we still have some concerns about the use and management of the TCP funds, which we will not take time to go into today. Both reports in CL 90/4 and CL 90/17 give us welcome news on the progress of the FINSYS/PERSYS systems. We note that a special team has been set up in-house to monitor the implementation of this project. Perhaps the Secretariat could tell us something about the relationship between this management group, I believe run from the Assistant Director-General, Finance and Administration's office, and the other in-house monitoring group of the Information Systems and Records Committee, the ISRC. Our reason for asking is that we have heard some corridor conversations in the last few days that ISRC had approved on 4 November the purchase for $1 million of a further computer for the operation of the FINSYS/PERSYS systems. If this information is correct-and as we see no report of it in our papers it may not be-could the Secretariat tell us whether this is a new expenditure and/or an unforeseen one? Another issue on clarification, this is felt appropriate by our colleague from Italy, is the matter of special contributions to the FAO. We had asked in a tentative way the other day a question which was very kindly responded to by Mr Crowther, but we would welcome further Information on these contributions, which we think are very generous indeed and which are outlined in paragraph 57 of document CL 90/17 and in paragraphs 40-43 of the Auditor's Report. The purposes for which these funds were intended or to which they were subsequently put are not entirely evident, although it has been estimated that they were in part to offset rental costs of additional accommodation. As the Secretariat will know we have long been concerned with the World Food Programme and the World Food Council have been paying commercial rent for their premises, derived from monies, in the case of the WFP, destined for programme food aid. We understand that the Government is seized by these problems and has promised some assistance in 1987. However, as the FAO is the intermediary with the Italian Government, with respect to the matter of the WFP's Headquarterts Agreement, we wonder if the Italian special contributions since 1971 were not intended, in part, to offset WFP's rental expenses. If so, have they been used for this purpose? Perhaps the Secretariat, in its reponse, could shed some special light on this question or, alternatively, give us Information on the historical uses of this money from the 1971 or 1972 period. We note in this respect, in document CL 90/17 paragraph 90 that the World Food Council has been invited to move to an alternative location. We wonder if the Secretariat could give us some information about this. It seems to us that would be a very tragic move, if the Council were obliged to leave this building and its proximity to resources which are available to it. There is another matter which is not clear to us. That is the matter of cross-subsidization, from the Regular Programme to the Field Programme. As the Organization is entering into a period of financial stringency (I have forgotten the term used by my Italian colleague this morning) was \"transitory period of financial liquidity problems\", certainly not a crisis, but a period of financial stringency, it would appear prudent that the which placed elsewhere. We can see, the problems which the Secretariat has. As the Director-General has often said, the Regular Programme and the Field Programme are virtually inseparable. However, we have heard at other times that Regular Programme officers spend as much as 30 to 40 percent of their time on Field Programme activities. Paragraph 73 of document CL 90/17 and paragraph 9 on page 2 of the audited accounts, make reference to a figure of $9. 5 We are not sure exactly what this figure means. Is it the total assessed value of cross-subsidization? If so was this sum Field Programme monies? We would welcome this a subsequent fuller consideration, perhaps in the context of a study on programme delivery costs, of the full extent of specifically to accounts presented in document 87/5 we will confine our remarks to two issues. The first relates to the extremely interesting observations made and Finance Committees, a careful reading of paragraphs 7 to 22 of the Auditor's report. These can be found at pages 5 to 10 of document 87/5. -408- We preface our remarks on Chis we not treat these paragraphs as any criticism or condemnation of the Organization, but rather as a of have increased budgeting and evaluation. We have long been concerned that the Finance and Programme Committees have not been fully effective management tools, due to the lack of definitive information available to them. Sometimes this concern has been expressed as a lack of transparency, used, we hope, in a constructive rather than a pejorative sense. In this connection, the External Auditor points out in paragraph 10. 1, that whilst the Regular Programme is built up from sub-programmes the present monitoring system does not disclose financial inputs at this level. Accordingly, he observed that there can be no export facto review of sub-programme expenditures. Similarly, there seems no monitoring at the sub-programme level, as he indicates in paragraph 10. 2. In paragraph 10. 3 it is indicated that the budgetary process is not equipped to monitor by objective latterly review formed. These views are amplified in paragraphs 15. 1 to 15. 4 on page 8 of the report. We will not quote them or read from them again, but we feel that these observations are extremely pertinent. We note the Secretariat's response that there is a need for flexibility in the programming exercise and that there are costs associated with the suggested changes in the PLANSYS system. activities. The second subject we would like to touch on is that of the procurement of word processing and data processing equipment. This is reported on by the External. Auditor in paragraphs 23 to 39 of his report. We are the first to acknowledge that whilst the area of EDP equipment, computing systems and so on, is an extremely tricky one, as is evidenced by the unfortunate experiences we have observed. in a wide variety of institutions, we do not want to be unfair in an area where technical changes occur very, very quickly. However, we have two concerns that we must express based on the information which is before us in this report. The first of these concerns process. We are particularly concerned that a control process put in place internally by FAO, namely the Information Systems and Resources Committee (the ISRC I believe it is called) seems to have been circumvented at a crucial stage in this particular also that specified requirements seen to have been lost sight of in implementing this contract. Particularly, we are very concerned with the violence which has been done to the propriety of the tendering process. A process which was set up to avoid both abuse of the purchasing system and to provide protection from the appearance of any malfeasance. In most tendering systems the submission of a non-conforming tender, namely the offer of equipment which was other dismissed or, alternatively, other competing tenderers are offered a chance to bid on the same basis. In this case, neither appears to have been done and the contract was awarded to a firm, who had not previously done business with FAO and, who on the basis of this particular entree, apparently has sold considerably more equipment than was envisaged in their original tender price or was otherwise specified. In its response to our queries on this point we would certainly welcome a reaffirmation of the Secretariat and its views that this process has been entirely proper. Also an indication as they contract, we note that as the Organization moved to a word processing generation on a large scale, we completely sympathise with its desire, based on consultants' reports, to move beyond, stand alone or be independent of the word processing machinery, We also sympathise with the attention which seeking uniformity and compatibility. As we understand, from the paper in front of us, this resulted in the tender process seeking a number, some 19 I believe, shared-access systems which would combine the benefits of compatibility and intra-systems connection to those normally found on standard word processing equipment. The contract as it eventuated seems to have gone for a very early version of an advanced local area network system, which has proved, for one reason or another, to be impractical to fully install. The result as we understand it although we do not understand it well, is that there are now some 200 word processors in place operating on a stand-alone basis, together with four large computer units in place, for which there appears to be no substantive use. -409- We understand that a move towards this local area network system has been put in abeyance, or on hold, pending further study and review. We wonder if the Secretariat could provide us with further information on this technical aspect of the computer problem. Particularly, as to whether there will be a substantive use found for the central computing units, the four units, that have not been implemented, installed or otherwise linked up to the word processing system. Will they be used ultimately in the local area network, or could they be used otherwise, for example, in connection with the FINSYS/PERSYS system? Almir F. de S\u00e1 BARBUDA (Brasil): First I on behalf on my delegation to thank Ambassador Bukhari for the comprehensive presentation of this item of the agenda. My delegation is very pleased with the work that has been done by the Finance Committe and we wish to comment on some features presented by the reports of its last two sessions. Document CL 90/4 provides us, in paragraph 62 to 64, with the valuable Information of FAO's activities in support of TCDC in an area which deserves our full support. We are very pleased to note that both the Committee and the Joint Inspection Unit report both recognize that has been taken to implement new computerized systems relating to financial data and personnel information and that phase one of the project will be completed by next spring. We also appreciated the Information provided in regard to the relations between the Organization and the Host Government and that the traditional spirit of cooperation has prevailed in the discussions. The letter exchanged last June is a very positive sign of these understandings and they deserve the full support of this Council. We wish as well to thank the Italian Government for the very positive attitude announced this morning. We wish as well to thank the Director-General, as stated in paragraph 74 to 77 of the report of the 57th Session of the Committee for having brought to the consideration of the Finance Committee this subject of greater transparency in the work of the Organization and for having made available the information requested by Member relation to the audited accounts as examined by the report of the 58th Session of the Committee, we took special note that: first, the external auditor considered the system of budgetary planning and monitoring of Regular Programme inputs to be comprehensive and operating as intended. Second, the nature of programme budgetary requirements reflected the basic tests in financial rules. Third, the assessment of the external auditor was positive in regard to the systems and procedures for work planning. Fourthly, action has been taken to improve the quality and the regularity of FAO country representaive reports. We regard as very positive the conclusions reached the Committee, even in futher development of PLANSYS which should be linked to the development of FINSYS and PERSYS and the framing of future tenders, paragraph 56. We take note as well of the recommendations made by the external auditor in relation to the participation of FAO in the UNDP during 1984/85 and of the action being taken by the Organization to implement them, steps which were welcomed by the auditor. In relation to the WFP report and statement, document C 87/7 we wish to remember that Mr Ingram, the Executive Director for the Programme provided, during the 22nd Session of the CFA, extensive on the issue of the WFP information system raised by the external auditor. The CFA in its final report recognized that while regretting the money spent, the Programme had learned important its experience, evidenced by the successful implementation of the first phase of WIS now in operation. My delegation believes that as a whole the reports of the external autitor are positive and that some recommendations have been presented and will be implemented. Finally, we wish to support paragraph 76 of the 57th Session that commends the Director-General's management of the Organization. We therefore wish to gi ve our support to the draf t resolution on audited accounts to be submitted to the Conference. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): As I said in my intervention on this matter of the finances of the Organization last week, Australia was represented on the Finance Committee for both these sessions. In relation to the 58th Report I will just underline a couple of points. -410- We note that in relation to the proposal to provide office space for FAO in Harare. Zimbabwe, that the Committee expressed some concern about the type of arangement proposed and expressed a note of caution about the general extension of this kind of solution to the problem of office space for FAO representatives. We note that information will provided to the 60th Session of the Committee relating to arrangement for provision of office space for in Member Countries. We also note the the auditor mentioned in the 58th Report about the process of installation, of tendering for an installation of word processing and data processing equipment. On this issue I can only underline the comments already made by the United Kingdom and Canada on this matter and note that the Finance Committee was assured that the auditors' recommendations, including those to framing of future tenders, had been accepted. We feel that the ne tting of such major contracts is a most important matter and that therefore particular care must be exercised by the organization in the processes followed in relation to assessment of system and awarding of contracts. We await the answers of the Secretariat to the questions raised by the United Kingdom and Canada with some interest. We have already dealt the other day with our views on the proposals for dealing with the problems of delayed payments of assessed contributions and as we said, we support the Finance Committee looking at alternatives 3, 4 and 5. On the specific questions of developments regarding Headquarters Accommodation we have no particular comments to make other than to remark that we see some merit in separate housing of FAO, WFP, IFAD and WFC consistent with sound financial management and budgetary limitations. We do note that there have been some uncertainties relating to the accommodation of the WFC and we trust that a solution can be found to the future housing of the WFC that is consistent with the interests and desires of both FAO and the WFC. In relation to what the Finance Committee has to do in D ecember, there have been a few comments on this. I must say the impression of my delegation, particularly in the light of the announcement made the other day by the United States, which gave a little more substance to the shortfall in finance that is going to be faced, is being faced, we do feel that the committee needs to concentrate, not just on the short term situation, which I believe is the more serious of the problems, but to start to look seriously at the longer term situation so that the Organization can start to address this problem of the shortfall in funds and what that means for the programmes in a serious way. In that context, in the present financial crisis the work of the Finance Committee assumes an even greater importance than in normal times. Australia will continue to do all it can to make that work useful and to see that it continues to contribute in a positive way to the efficient operations of FAO. In that context we are pleased to note, as was discussed earlier this session, and this was also mentioned by the United Kingdom, that the question of programme delivery costs will be considered by the Finance Committee next spring. Lastly, we give our general endorsement to the question raised by some other speakers, particularly the United Kingdom and Canada and I commend those delegations for the detailed work that they have put into examining the reports. In general terms the Australian delegations can endorse the acceptance by Council of the Finance Co mmittee reports, including the draft conference resolution set out in 67. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): We are not members of the Finance Committee so that I think it is appropriate that we thank our colleague, Ambassador Bukhari for the very fair and useful manner in which the Finance Committee has done its work and reflected the comments of the external auditor. I would like convey our thanks to Ambassador Pascarelli and to Italy that this time it has improvised a reponse which is very sensible and generous. It is not for us to recommend a course of action for a number of donor countries which have been generous for these many years but I do not think, it would be frivolous to state that part of the problems faced by the major donor are because of the intense balance of payments problems is facing; but the are really a number of other developed countries have benefited from and to the extent that a country like Italy, which has partly improved its balance of payments and other things, has responded in a positive way, which shows both a flexible and generous response. I would like to draw attention to the point made by my neighbour, the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, that considering that this meeting of the Council was dealing with an important matter relating to financing and both medium-term and long-term problems, we wish the Secretariat had given us the information and the auditors reports in a more timely manner. After all, a number -411- of documents The auditors' reports were ready quite some time ago and the Finance Committee also had done its job in September. No doubt there are problems in preparing documents all at once but considering the importance of the Council Meeting and the fact that the Director-General wanted the views of the Council on a number of matters, of which perhaps financial problems facing the Organization are the most important, we wish it could have been done earlier. I do not wish to go into too much detail on many of the points raised by many of the representatives here, and particularly the very concrete points made by our colleague from Canada, put in a very civilized way, but I think it is but fair to separate some of the points made. One is the fact regarding the financial management and running of the FAO: the second is the report of the external auditor; the third is the examination of the external auditor's report by the Finance Committee. Part of the problems which have arisen are really that formerly auditing was really to see whether the rules had been observed. The question of a value-for-work audit is a concept which is only gradually being accepted even in governments and to some perhaps quite rightly, has under Article 12. 4 of the Financial Regulations gone into the question of the proper use, not just the proper procedures which are followed, of course. He points regarding proper procedures also but basically the line is, even if proper procedures have been followed, has money been put to proper use. We do not need to question the motivation or propriety of these things but I think that in fairness to the Finance Committee most of the points raised have been amply reflected in the Finance Committee's own Report. Obviously the Finance Committee cannot go into the same amount of detail as the external auditor, it has to summarize, and I notice most of the things are here and it is the duty of the Secretariat to take note of these points so that there is no recurrence of these problems. In particular regarding the word processing issue which has been raised by a number of delegates, I do not want to labour further on it. There is a point made in paragraph 37 of document C 87/5. There is a further risk that the study may itself be constrained by the need to utilize existing equipment. This is a very serious matter but since the equipment has already been purchased the tendency is to accept the fait accompli and perhaps this may turn out to be rather economical, but this is a point which the external auditor has made which might need to be borne in mind. However, I would also like to point out that the external auditor has brought to the attention of the Finance the arise from perhaps too detailed attention to procedures. If we observe document C 87/7, page 7, relating to the WFP, here there is no reference to disregard of procedures. It looks as followed over- as a a $3 million expenditure has been considered nugatory. I presume it means that that money has been lost or wasted. It goes on further to state: \"When my staff examined the system in October 1985 it had been functioning for only a short period and was still suffering from a number of problems, of which the most serious was an unacceptably long response time. \" I think the Finance Committee in dealing with both these matters has pointed out that the External Auditor had drawn attention to certain flaws and that the Finance Committee had drawn the attention of the Organization to take corrective action. Suharyo HUSEN (Indonesia): First of all on behalf of the Indonesian delegation I would like to express my appreciation to the Chairman of the Finance Committee, His Excellency Atif Bukhari, the documents before us, CL 90/4 and CL 90/17. My thanks to the Secretariat for providing us with the comprehensive documents. I will start to express my delegation's views on document CL 90/4. My delegation welcomes and gives full support to the Report of the Fifty-Seventh Session of the Finance Committee. In line with the previous statement of my delegation concerning the financial crisis of the Organization I am concerned very much about paragraph 19 of CL 90/4, where 105 Member Nations made no payments against their 1986 assessment. I strongly support the appeal made by the Finance Committee, as contained in paragraph 26 of the document before us-that is, to appeal to all Member Nations to make a special effort to meet their outstanding contribution without further delay. In this connection, my delegation would like to express its appreciation to the government of Italy for its efforts to help the Organization to overcome its financial problems, and I fully support the appeal made by His Excellency Ambassador Pascarelli in his by the will be followed by other large contributors. -412- Regarding the Report of the Fifty-Eighth Session of the Finance Committee, as contained in document CL 90/17, 1 would like, present my delegation's views as follows. My delegation welcomes and fully approves My delegation fully with the Finance Committee's concern about a significant imbalance as regards the recruitment of consultants on a regional basis, as set out in paragraph 9 of the document before us, namely to urge the Secretariat to make further efforts in improving the recruitment of consultants in the future. My delegation welcomes and appreciates the Report of the Draft Resolution on audited accounts to be provided to the Conference for its approval. My delegation fully agrees with paragraph 80 Finance concer n on updating th e statistics on personnel services. Regarding amendments to Regulations 301 0333 and 0334, my delegation gives its approval to the amendments set out in paragraph 83, page 23 of document CL 90/17\u00b7 Evlogui BONEV (UNDP): I will be very brief as I am responding to the specific request of the delegate of the United Kingdom, who expressed a desire to hear the reaction of UNDP specifically on the Auditor's Report on the status of funds advanced to the FAO by UNDP and more specifically on the review of the Inventory FAO controls for UNDP equipment. UNDP studied the documents presented to the Council on this matter and noted the Report of the External Auditor on the statement showing as at 31 December 1985 the status of funds advanced to the FAO by the United Nations Development Programme. I would like just to explain what is the normal proceeding in UNDP in Auditors' to the Governing Council each year together with the report on what follow-up action that UNDP and the agency concerned has taken in respect of observations made by the auditors. I contacted my headquarters about this question and I understand that the Administrator is taking steps in conjunction with the FAO to have a meeting of the responsible departments and arrange that measures are taken that the recommendations of the Auditors are being put into implementation, as the Administrator is fully accountable to the Governing Council for the Gblorzuo TOWEH (Liberia): I would like to take this opportunity to express on behalf of my delegation our gratitude to the Chairman of the Finance Committee for his Report. Regarding contributions, I am pleased to inform you that we have brought with us ou r 1986 contributio n and we will do all we can to pay our arrears before the first half of 1987. Regarding the Auditors' Report, we hope that the Secretariat will take note of the recommendations therein. Finally, let me add my voice on behalf of my delegation to other delegates who have thanked the Italian government for the extra efforts being made towards our Organization. Meanwhile I would like to take this special opportunity to express on behalf of my delegation our gratitude to the Director-General and his staff for trying their very best to cut down some of the expenses and keep our budget in line. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): La delegaci\u00f3n de Venezuela quiere simplemente expresar primero su satisfacci\u00f3n por el informe que estamos estudiando y, por ello, presenta sus congratulaciones al amigo Embajador Bukhari que lo ha presentado. Luego, expresar nuestro apoyo a este informe, pero no quisi\u00e9ramos dejar pasar por alto algo que no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo llamarlo, que no nos satisface plenamente y es el tono de las cr\u00edticas, de las observaciones que encontramos en algunas delegaciones, especialmente en el Reino Unido, Canad\u00e1 y Australia, en donde revela que se est\u00e1 estudiando un informe de finanzas como si esto fuera una empresa y nosotros fu\u00e9ramos unos accionistas que estamos estudiando al detalle las ganancias y las p\u00e9rdidas que tenemos de nuestro dinero invertido, y yo tengo entendido, y asi lo piensa Venezuela y supongo que los pa\u00edses en desarrollo as\u00ed lo miran, que esto no es una compa\u00f1\u00eda para invertir y para ganar; es una empresa. Si vamos a ver qu\u00e9 responsabilidad tenemos, no tan solo con los pa\u00edses en desarrollo, sino con aquellos -413- pa\u00edses que a la gente le gusta llamar del Tercer Mundo, no s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 en un todo medio despectivo, queriendo decir los pa\u00edses que todav\u00eda no han alcanzado la categor\u00eda de pa\u00edses. No olvidemos por qu\u00e9 estos pa\u00edses est\u00e1n todav\u00eda asi, y nosotros los pa\u00edses del Tercer Mundo, que tambi\u00e9n pasamos por ese periodo, que apenas salimos de \u00e9l o empezamos a salir de \u00e9l hace 150 a\u00f1os, que no hemos recorrido a plenitud el camino del desarrollo para sentirnos en igualdad de circunstancias con los pa\u00edses que les gusta llamarse desarrollados. Por esta raz\u00f3n pienso que esto, que esta participaci\u00f3n en la FAO no es la participaci\u00f3n de un inversionista que quiere ver cuanto resulta su dinero y cuanto le gana y cu\u00e1nto se pierde, sino que es una responsabilidad colectiva de la humanidad con esos pa\u00edses a quienes debemos, en cierta manera, con un criterio distinto, ayudar para que puedan disfrutar alguna vez, no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1ndo y en muy largo plazo, de esa presuposici\u00f3n que est\u00e1 escrita en la carta de las Naciones Unidas, a la cual ellos tienen derecho; es decir, ser pa\u00edses soberanos capaces de la autodeterminaci\u00f3n como pueblos libres para darse no solamente el gobierno, sino una vida mejor. Por esa raz\u00f3n, cuando encontramos comparaciones en algunas de las intervenciones como una que voy a dar s\u00f3lo por ejemplo como muestra, comparar las toneladas o lo que cuesta mandar toneladas del PMA y lo que cuesta un programa de capacitaci\u00f3n de la FAO, yo pienso que no es lo mismo llenar est\u00f3magos hambrientos con excedentes de \u00e9ste o aquel pa\u00eds que tratar de preparar mediante un programa de capacitaci\u00f3n, de educar esta gente que est\u00e1 atrasada, que son los programas de la FAO. No podemos establecer una comparaci\u00f3n en un sola linea de este programa y de aquel otro y de lo que cuesta este programa y de lo que cuesta el otro, y casi todos los ejemplos y todas las cr\u00edticas que hacen estos pa\u00edses al Programa de la FAO, puestos siempre en blanco y negro, son de esta misma naturaleza. Por eso, yo pienso que, sin ser excesivamente tolerante o como se dice en ingl\u00e9s sin ser lenient, no podemos dejar de pensar que los programas de la FAO deben ser tomados, considerados y evaluados con este criterio, que no es un criterio de comerciante, que no es un criterio de rendimiento de dinero, sino que es un criterio con el que se tienen que valorizar \u00edo que esos programas significan, lo que ellos dan a esos pa\u00edses y a esos pueblos que los est\u00e1n recibiendo. Es algo que no podemos valorar en dinero, en d\u00f3lares, c\u00e9ntimos o en bol\u00edvares, o en liras, sino son programas y resultados que debemos valorar desde otro punto de vista. Y me excusan por algo que puede parecer inoportuno, pero que est\u00e1n de acuerdo con mi criterio y con mi sentimiento. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I am sorry to delay this debate which has already taken so much time. However, I asked your permission to come back on the point concerning organizational matters. I refer to document CL 90/17, this time as Host Country, and nothing to do with the financial, or so-called liquidity problems. In the report of our Committee-and I am glad that at least some of the Members did pay tribute to the Members of the Finance Committee-I heard some criticism as though the Finance Committee had been sitting for ten days for nothing; the discoverers of some points to pick out and show off. I am so sorry to say that because as a Finance Committee we have done our job. We are very proud of what we have presented. I am very grateful to those who have expressed their appreciation for what we have done, in particular, the Ambassador of India mentioned that. I should like to touch briefly on one point raised in the Finance Committee. We were committed to report to the Council, (following the Conference vote) on the relationship with the Host Government, on two points-privileges and immunity. Two months ago in the report, we gave a summary of the efforts we had undertaken. I am glad to report to this Council that we are so close to a conclusion, in the most liberal way, of our so-called differences with the Organisation. Concerning both privileges and have practically reached an agreement. I had hoped that we could have signed it. The other day my Minister said \"You have not signed yet? What are you waiting for?\" I called the Secretariat and I am very hopeful that we might tell you that there are no clouds in our skies. By the way, when I began my career, Count Sforza was our Minister and he was famous in Europe for a book called \"Builders and Destroyers\" (\"costruttori e distruttorl\"). As a diplomat at the end of my career, I am very happy to have operated wherever possible among the \"costruttori\" and not and destroyers or demolishers. Being a builder I have to talk about buildings. We have the agreement that has been submitted to you, in the exchange of letters between the Director-General and myself. May I announce to the Council that after presentation of the Bill to Parliament, the Senate is handling the matter, and we fervently hope that by the end of this year the Bill will be approved and so the Lit. 25 billion, perhaps worth a little more a year ago-fortunately not much, because the rate of inflation has been quite moderate, but this Lit. 25 billion for the buildings is, as we say, sliding over to 1987. It is no t entirely our fault or that of FAO either. We had some postponement due to procedures to be followed, and then a crisis occurred and then we had summer, so the whole thing was delayed by at least six months. -414- In the new premises that you see on the plans and exchange of letters, FAO will prosper we hope, but not grow too much-family planning must be applied here. We also hope that the little difference that has been mentioned by my Canadian colleague on the World Food Council accommodation can be solved. As a matter of fact, these buildings will be large enough to accommodate FAO as it is projected, but unfortunately not the World Food Programme. This is a new announcement that I am making today: the World Food Programme is going to have a different building together with IFAD. Of course, since the World Food Programme is part of FAO and part of the UN at the same time, they have no autonomy and a Hea dquarters Agreement w ill be needed by the time that the building is ready. Provisionally we are going to make all efforts in order to help the World Food Programme to pay the rent with money not subtracted from the contributions to the operations of the Programme. Already this year we have given half of the rent, and next year we hope to give the full rent. I cannot promise, because I am not the Treasury Minister and as I said last time it will have to be discussed. In the document presented to the Council by the Secretariat (page 3, paragraph 8, document CL 90/22) I read the last sentence of paragraph 8 (English text) \"Moreover, it is hoped that, in the light of the considerations set out in paragraph 5 above, appropriate arrangements can be made separately with the Government regarding the status of the rented premises\"\u00b7 If we take care when reading the exchange of notes between the Director-General, Dr Saouma, and myself, we will find in the very first sentence of the letter from Dr Saouma, and I quote: \"In order to avoid offices of the Organization being situated outside the said complex and in buildings that are not owned by the Italian State. \" This affords me the occasion to make it clear and ask the question \"What is it actually that FAO expects of us through these \"appropriate arrangements\" if not relying completely on the goodwill of Government of Italy?\" have not considered any steps that might need ratification by Parliament. The Legal Counsel of FAO is very well aware that a previous exchange of letters covering the first addition we made to building \"A\", (B, C and D etc. ) have been blocked in a branch of Parliament, which means that they do not want to approve it. They would not approve now because this is a comprehensive exchange and the definition of the Seat of the Organization is here, not outside. Whatever FAO has outside has to run risks, and they know what the risks are. Fortunately, we have no clouds in our sky concerning immunity and we hope never to have any. I think that is about all I have to say on the subject concerning the contributions from 1971-72 to 1985-86, I do not think it will be so interesting for the Council to listen to. There is a Finance Committee, let the Finance Committee do its job and not make another Finance Committee out of this Council. Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo): beaucoup d'attention ces deux rapports et la mani\u00e8re s'acquitte a des \u00e9conomies d\u00e9penses de f\u00e9licitons \u00e9galement la FAO de l'exc\u00e9dent de tr\u00e9sorer ie de plus de 34 millions pour ce renoncent \u00e0 partage de l'examen de ce document 90/4, \u00e0 plus grande transparence dans les activit\u00e9s de la FAO, dans le but de cr\u00e9er un climat de confiance entre le Secr\u00e9tariat l'on veut y trop au document 90/17, ne -415- pas que Je pense que toute organisation aspire \u00e0 cela. Il en est de m\u00eame tout ira pour le mieux dans les ann\u00e9es \u00e0 venir. ce Siempre nuestro colega Bukhari, Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Finanzas nos ha hecho una excelente presentaci\u00f3n. Queremos sumarnos a lo que acaba de decir nuestro vecino de la derecha el Embajador del Congo, en el sentido de apoyar la actitud positiva del Embajador Pascarelli y reiterar el llamado para que otros pa\u00edses, sobre todo importantes contribuyentes, asuman una actitud semejante. Empezamos por declarar que la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia reconoce el derecho legitimo que tienen los representantes de todos los Estados a preocuparse por la buena marcha de la Organizaci\u00f3n y, desde luego, serla deseable que ese celo y esa inquietud tuviera el mismo cumplimiento no s\u00f3lo en la FAO, sino en todas las dem\u00e1s organizaciones. Estamos de acuerdo con lo que ha dicho la distinguida Embajadora de Venezuela sobre la forma como se ha planteado este debate y tambi\u00e9n con el Embajador Pascarelli, quien ha dicho que \u00e9ste es el Consejo que tiene un organismo asesor muy importante, que es el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y, como su nombre lo indica y sus funciones lo determinan, es el \u00e1mbito adecuado para tratar estas cuestiones. Realmente, queremos hablar con toda sinceridad. Pensamos que hemos asistido esta ma\u00f1ana con atenci\u00f3n y con todo respeto a las declaraciones que se han hecho, sobre todo porque sabemos el trasfondo y el sentido hacia donde van dirigidas esas declaraciones. Pero hubiera sido mejor plantear todo esto en una perspectiva m\u00e1s adecuada, para beneficio mismo de quienes han hecho estas declaraciones. Si ellos en privado se dirigen a la Secretaria habr\u00edan recibido inclusive informaci\u00f3n mas detallada, m\u00e1s directa de la que han podido obtener aqu\u00ed en el seno de este Consejo. Hubiera sido m\u00e1s conveniente no habernos hecho perder el tiempo, aunque siempre les respeto y reconozco su derecho a intervenir, pero habr\u00eda sido m\u00e1s eficaz para ellos mismos. Tambi\u00e9n olmos con atenci\u00f3n al representante de un pa\u00eds cuyo gobierno es miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. El representante de ese pa\u00eds apoy\u00f3 lo que hablan dicho Reino Unido y Canad\u00e1, pero leyendo el informe del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas observamos que el representante de ese mismo Gobierno en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas no dej\u00f3 ninguna reserva. Aqu\u00ed parece que el Co mit\u00e9 de Finanzas, y esto podr\u00e1 confirmarlo el Presidente, estuvo un\u00e1nime en reconocer que se hablan hecho observaciones que eran constructivas y que la Secretarla las aplicar\u00eda y todo se mejorar\u00eda en el futuro. Yo creo tambi\u00e9n, que cuando se interviene en debates como \u00e9ste seria necesario tener en cuenta el respeto que todos debemos sentir por una Organizaci\u00f3n a cuya Administraci\u00f3n hemos concedido nuestra confianza y, por lo tanto, tal vez, lo decimos de manera flexible, no ser\u00eda convenient e suscitar dudas o plantear criticas que no est\u00e1n debidamente fundadas y pueden crear malestar o incertidumbre injustificadas\u00b7 Hemos admirado muy sinceramente a unos distinguidos colegas que est\u00e1n cerca de nosotros, delante de nuestra fila en esta Sala, que intervienen con un estilo de aparente ingenuidad por el tono y el contenido un poco sibilino de sus declaraciones, que siempre comienzan con felicitaciones, agradecimientos y elogios a la Secretaria y que luego expresan iron\u00edas, comentarios m\u00e1s o menos velados que reflejan una profunda y bien dirigida malicia refinada, que se enfrenta con nuestra propia malicia, que es ind\u00edgena y por lo tanto es m\u00e1s aguda y genuina. No acostumbramos a pronunciar el nombre de ning\u00fan pa\u00eds y tampoco lo haremos esta ma\u00f1ana, pero admiramos que sus delegados vengan desde Londres muy bien preparados, muy documentados. Nos suministran aqu\u00ed una proliferaci\u00f3n de datos incre\u00edbles, pormenorizados, demostrando un conocimiento profundo de lo interno de la Organizaci\u00f3n, que no lo tenemos ni siquiera nosotros, los que vivimos a este lado del Canal de la Mancha. Esta observaci\u00f3n la hacemos, se\u00f1or Presidente, de manera muy espont\u00e1nea, desprevenida y sin ninguna alusi\u00f3n a un pasado reciente. De todas maneras yo creo que seria lamentable que se instrumentalizaran cuestiones que en el pasado se han considerado rutinarias para tratar ahora de vincularlas a circunstancias coyunturales bien conocidas, para utilizarlas con ciertos fines -416- discutibles. Afortunadamente la gran mayor\u00eda de los miembros de este Consejo, por lo menos 46, somos personas que actuamos con mucha sensatez, con buen \u00e1nimo y que, naturalmente, respetamos la manera como act\u00faan otros colegas. Sin duda convendr\u00eda en el futuro que se tuvieran en cuenta ciertas maneras de actuar, porque la democracia ofrece s itios, oportunidades y formas para lograr ciertos prop\u00f3sitos, lo cual no corresponde al marco dentro del cual se ha adelantado este debate en el seno del Consejo. Parece tambi\u00e9n que algunos de nuestros colegas estuvieran demasiado agitados, profundamente inquietos, tremendamente exacerbados, hasta una obsesi\u00f3n que llega a enseriecerlos un poco. Yo me habla olvidado de un asunto que planet\u00f3 la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia en la Sala Verde. Por eso agradezco a los colegas Embajadores de India y Congo que hayan recordado el p\u00e1rrafo 64 del documento 90/17, donde habla de tres millones in\u00fatiles que se perdieron, pero en fin, esas cosas para esas otras delegaciones no tienen importancia porque el objetivo es otro y est\u00e1 bien identificarlo. Finalmente, queremos manifestar que cuanto a licitaciones, contratos, representantes de los informes en los palees, la Secretarla les va a responder, pero en el caso de Colombia cuando tenemos dudas respecto a estas materias nos acercamos a la Secretar\u00eda y siempre encontramos una respuesta amplia, transparente, detallada y muy acertada. Creemos que el Auditor hizo observaciones, que el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas las consider\u00f3 constructivas, que la Secretaria las ha recibido con esp\u00edritu sereno y que se ha manifestado despuesta a explicarlas, luego la situaci\u00f3n es satisfactoria, aprobaremos el proyecto de Resoluci\u00f3n que mandaremos a la Conferencia y confiamos todos en que se va a seguir mejorando la gesti\u00f3n de la FAO. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (M\u00e9xico): La delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico, como todas las que nos han precedido en el uso de la palabra, expresa su m\u00e1s sinceras felicitaciones al Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Finanzas por el estupendo informe que nos present\u00f3 esta ma\u00f1ana y tambi\u00e9n por haber dirigido de manera tan eficaz y sabia los trabajos de dicho Comit\u00e9. S\u00e9 que es tarde, se\u00f1or Presidente, y mi declaraci\u00f3n, por tanto, ser\u00e1 breve. Por eso quiero unirme a las declaraciones de Yugoslavia, Brasil, Liberia, India, Venezuela, Congo, y ahora Colombia. Agradecemos junto con estas y otras delegaciones al Gobierno anfitri\u00f3n por su postura y reacci\u00f3n tan pos itiva hacia la FAO y tambi\u00e9n nos congratulamos de las buenas relaciones entre nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n y ese Gobierno. Agradecemos al Director General su esfuerzo de transparencia que deja ver la eficiencia alcanzada por nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n. Elogiamos en este sentido el esfuerzo y la consecuci\u00f3n de importantes econom\u00edas que muestran cu\u00e1nto se ha avanzado el lograr ahorros y hacer m\u00e1s eficiente los trabajos, la funci\u00f3n de la FAO. El proceso de una mayor claridad, presentaci\u00f3n y de mejoras en esa eficiencia en los trabajos de FAO, son necesariamente procesos paulatinos; pero si miramos para atr\u00e1s constataremos todo lo que se ha alcanzado gracias a ese esfuerzo y empe\u00f1o del Director General y de su equipo. Es ese un hecho, es esa una referencia seria y firme y no una cuesti\u00f3n subjetiva como lo puede ser el juicio circunstancial de una transparencia que cada quien entiende de manera distinta. Hoy debemos constatar que nuestra contribuci\u00f3n a FAO se gasta mejor y con mejores resultados, a pesar, ciertamente, de que nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n es hoy m\u00e1s grande y m\u00e1s compleja, pero tambi\u00e9n m\u00e1s eficaz. Subrayamos la flexibilidad que debemos darle al PCT y que \u00e9ste no se sujete a f\u00f3rmulas administrativas restrictivas que castiguen su ejecuci\u00f3n y manejo amplio. Respecto al informe del Auditor Externo, con congratulamos de las conclusiones positivas que se tienen, y en relaci\u00f3n a las dudas presentadas, y otras cuestiones aqu\u00ed evocadas, estas deben verse a la luz de lo dicho por la delegaci\u00f3n de Venezuela, es decir, en un contexto m\u00e1s amplio en donde se entienda la funci\u00f3n y las pr\u00e1cticas de una Organizaci\u00f3n tan compleja y con prop\u00f3sitos distintos a ser reducida a criterios de costo-beneficio. En todo caso, y sin atropellos deben llevarse estas cuestiones en particular por su detalle t\u00e9cnico al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas para su estudio detenido y profundo. Recordamos que el contexto en el que se encuentra la FAO, es decir, frente a las dificultades de liquidez que enfrenta, nos debe llevar a apoyarla ahora mucho m\u00e1s que antes, por eso no creemos pertinentes ciertas expresiones que pudieran debilitar o poner en duda y en forma a priori y prejuiciadas el concepto de eficiencia y de competencia para alcanzar sus metas con que el mundo ve y debe ver a nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n. Esas dudas deben dirimirse con toda tranquilidad y seriedad. Esto no es un circo donde se lanzan fieras para que se coman a inocentes. Es un Consejo donde nuestros juicios y conclusiones deben estar fundamentados sobre todo en el tipo de debates y de conclusiones t\u00e9cnicas que se realicen previamente en consultas con la Secrertaria y tambi\u00e9n por los Organos, o bien Comit\u00e9s especializados, y responsables de ello, tal como el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. -417- Ciertamente nos preocupan las dudas expuestas por el Auditor Externo y esperamos que la Secretar\u00eda d\u00e9 ahora respuesta a ellas en la medida de lo posible, as\u00ed como a las preguntas aqu\u00ed formuladas y que estas cuestiones se lleven finalmente al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, como ha sido ya propuesto. En relaci\u00f3n al equipo electr\u00f3nico, aunque nos preocupa lo que nos dice el Auditor Externo, nos congratulamos de que la FAO no haya perdido recursos como lo hicieron lamentablemente otras Organizaciones. En todo caso, nos gustar\u00eda saber en relaci\u00f3n al Programa de Campo que muestras us\u00f3 el Auditor Externo en relaci\u00f3n a los informes de los representantes de FAO para llegar a las conclusiones a la que lleg\u00f3. Nosotros consideramos que este Consejo debe llevar a la consideraci\u00f3n de la Conferencia la resoluci\u00f3n que el documento que ahora tratamos, propone y presenta. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Queremos felicitar a nuestro amigo el Embajador Bukhari por la presentaci\u00f3n de los temas que estamos discutiendo. Fue una presentaci\u00f3n amplia, pormenorizada y razonada del trabajo arduo y eficiente que ese Comit\u00e9 ha realizado en estos temas. Queremos tambi\u00e9n felicitar a Italia por su apoyo franco a la FAO: felicitar a Italia y a su embajador Pascarelli por su dinamismo en la gesti\u00f3n dentro de FAO. Realmente nos preocupa la forma en que se esta discutiendo. Queremos tambi\u00e9n expresar que cuando estamos sentados aqu\u00ed de antemano ya reconocemos el derecho que todos tenemos a analizar, a discutir, a discrepar y a proponer, pero tambi\u00e9n tenemos que analizar los m\u00e9todos para realizar esa acci\u00f3n de participaci\u00f3n. Los mecanismos financieros que hoy se cuestionan, o que se est\u00e1n cuestionando, los mecanismos financieros en su totalidad, se viene haciendo desde hace muchos a\u00f1os; entonces, nos preocupa que sea ahora, precisamente ahora que se exponga ese criterio total contra los mecanismos financieros de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Todos sabemos que los que han hablado en forma, dir\u00edamos, vamos aser gentiles, en forma en que han decidido resolver de una vez y por todas una idea personal, han tenido una intervenci\u00f3n muy amplia, muy activa en relaci\u00f3n a las finanzas no solamente en la FAO, sino en todos los organismos financieros del orbe en que participan activamente. Una prueba de que tienen competencia y experiencia es que nuestro Auditor es ingl\u00e9s y lleva muchos a\u00f1os, muchos a\u00f1os; creo que en la ultima Conferencia discut\u00edamos la procedencia o no de volverlo a contratar y se plante\u00f3 que por su capacidad, por su eficiencia y porque conoce muy bien la FAO y sus mecanismos hab\u00eda que aprobarlo; eso fue dicho as\u00ed en la Conferencia pasada, por lo tanto, creo que los m\u00e1s capacitados en este c\u00f3nclave colectivo de discusi\u00f3n tienen oportunidad siempre, durante todo el tiempo, de ayudar, de prevenir, de aconsejar, pero no es \u00fatil esperar un momento equis, un momento cr\u00edtico para poner en tela de juicio aqu\u00e9llo en lo que se ha participado tan activamente. La se\u00f1ora embajadora de Venezuela nos ha dado una lecci\u00f3n muy interesante de comportamiento en la comunidad internacional. Es verdad, la responsabilidad colectiva de la humanidad tiene que imponerse en contra de una inversi\u00f3n con objetivos espec\u00edficos de ganancias. Queremos tambi\u00e9n decir que si es dif\u00edcil, como se ha dicho por algunos colegas, estudiar con suficiente tiempo un documento, que se nos entrega relativamente tarde, o una semana antes del evento, si es dif\u00edcil hacer eso mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, o menos posible, es esperar que entendamos un an\u00e1lisis tan pormenorizado que trata de destruir el trabajo de una Secretaria y de un Comit\u00e9, que son \u00f3rganos colectivos, conformados colectivamente, y se trata de destruir con un an\u00e1lisis que podr\u00edamos con tiempo suficiente y con especialistas desentra\u00f1ar para saber qu\u00e9 se pretende, pero que en una hora antes yo no puedo entrar a considerar esos criterios, no es posible que en una hora me expliquen a m\u00ed todo lo contrario de lo que, un poco tarde, la Secretar\u00eda me entreg\u00f3 una semana antes. Ante esta situaci\u00f3n considero que todas las observaciones han sido analizadas. La Secretar\u00eda tomar\u00e1 nota, o ha tomado ya nota sobre aquellas que tengan soluci\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n que tengan soluciones inmediatas, as\u00ed como crear\u00e1 las condiciones para que los futuros eventos del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas entren a analizar las soluciones de las restantes. Por lo tanto, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n apoya en todas sus partes los documentos presentados por el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, presentados por el embajador Bukhari. Queremos hacer un apoyo especial a los trabajos de este Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y adem\u00e1s queremos aprobar el informe del Auditor interno con todas aquellas cuestiones en las que ha hecho hincapi\u00e9 y que el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas analiz\u00f3 y acept\u00f3 para crear mejores condiciones de trabajo. -418- En el mundo, no de hoy sino de todas las etapas de la humanidad, lo perfecto no existe; el perfeccionismo es la enfermedad de lo perfecto y hay que aspirar a la eficiencia, a la utilidad, a la creaci\u00f3n, pero creo que es una sobreestimaci\u00f3n crear la perf ecci\u00f3n. La FAO tiene aceptado por el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, algunas deficiencias en algunos aspectos de trabajo, lo reconoce y est\u00e1 trabajando por resolverlo, pero tambi\u00e9n a la FAO hay que ayudarla, no se puede solamente criticar y negarle fundamento de este trabajo financiero, que el fundamento del trabajo financiero es la contribuci\u00f3n a la que est\u00e1n obligados a dar, obligados, digo la palabra, y que no ofenda a nadie, obligados, que cuando estamos dentro de una comunidad estamos obligados a recibir y a dar por que esa es la comunidad; si yo quiero nada m\u00e1s que recibir no es una comunidad. En ese sentido, queremos, repito, apoyar los informes y el informe del Auditor interno y que se presenten a la pr\u00f3xima Conferencia. The meeting rose at 13. 00 hours.

My country being a member of the Finance Committee in the person of Mr Jalil, I feel it my duty to state on behalf of my delegation our support to the reports of the Finan ce Committee as presented by the Chairman of the Committee. We would also like to thank members of the Council who had expressed appreciation for the work of this Committee and we note various comments made by some delegations about the Finance Committee. We feel that the Committee can benefit from these comments and take them in a constructive light. As mentioned by the delegate of Cuba, there is no such thing as perfection. We have to work continuously towards perfection and I believe that this Organization can benefit by taking these comments in a constructive light. We also would to Ambassador announcing the short term financial difficulties faced by this Organization and would like to echo the part of the report which calls for members of this Organization to try to help solve the problem of arrears in payments of their contributions. We are very well pleased with the way the discussions have taken place on this item. Even though most matters have been explained in the report, there are certain other matters already been brought up by some of the delegates who have spoken previously, especially with regard audited account for 1984/85 which we think with further clarification. This specifically refers to the problem in connection with WFP information system regarding the loss of $3 million and the reasons why steps have not been taken to take litigation against the company. The second matter is with regard to loss of materials which were supposed to be sent to Member Countries under the Food Aid Programme. Such losses have been said to amount to up to 30 percent. The last one is with regard to the continued supply of grains to countries which have experienced surpluses to meet their local requirements and some even for export. I believe these matters have been taken note of by the WFP and we would like to have some clarification on sais que cela entra\u00eene certain nombre pour le para\u00eet important: quelle est meilleure l'Organisation? -422- Serait-il \u00e9galement document CL 90/17 le point de la situation dans les diff\u00e9rents organismes de la famille m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 souhaiter une meilleure entre la FAO et le PAM.

Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Mi delegaci\u00f3n desea intervenir otra vez, se\u00f1or Presidente, en forma breve y en relaci\u00f3n con la situaci\u00f3n financiera y, esta vez, a prop\u00f3sito del tema 11 de la agenda referente al an\u00e1lisis de los informes de las sesiones 57 y 58 del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. Expres\u00f3 mi delegaci\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Presidente, que la publicaci\u00f3n del documento CL 90/17 y de otros en el mes de noviembre, no ha permitido a todas las delegaciones examinar con igual detenci\u00f3n la situaci\u00f3n financiera, tanto en los aspectos de diagn\u00f3stico como en los de terapia. Consecuentemente en la actual situaci\u00f3n, mi delegaci\u00f3n no est\u00e1 en condiciones de pronunciarse respecto de las notables propuestas del eminente representante de Italia, como habr\u00eda sido nuestro deseo, m\u00e1xime teniendo en cuenta su llamamiento hecho a los Estados no miembros del Consejo. En estrecha relaci\u00f3n con las actividades y posiciones de tales Estados no miembros del Consejo, mi delegaci\u00f3n debe hacer notar que en un primer an\u00e1lisis de esta documentaci\u00f3n no ha podido encontrar antecedentes complementarios, que podr\u00eda enterar el cuadro general de todos los desembolsos de los Estados a la Organizaci\u00f3n, por cuanto aparte de las contribuciones o cuotas, mi pa\u00eds aporta a la FAO por ejemplo, una suma de dinero adicional cercana a un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares anuales para el sostenimiento de la Oficina Regional para Am\u00e9rica Latina, situada en Santiago, y la representaci\u00f3n de la FAO en Chile. Antecedentes que no vemos en la documentaci\u00f3n entregada. Deseamos recibir alguna informaci\u00f3n de la Secretar\u00eda acerca de la posibilidad de ampliar en el futuro el objeto o alcance de textos similares al ap\u00e9ndice \"A\" del documento CL 90/17 y al CL 90/LIM l, para que incluyan todos los aportes y cuotas de los Estados a la FAO por cualquier concepto e igualmente, para que esta clase de documentos den a conocer simult\u00e1neamente la exacta cuota b\u00e1sica de cada Estado en el a\u00f1o calendario vigente. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I would just like to respond to a point made by the delegate of Colombia. I am not sure whether I got his point exactly as I am afraid 1 was listening in translation. But I thought I heard a suggestion th at the comments made by the British delegation this morning were based on information not available to the remainder of the Council. In fact we were in receipt of no information not in the papers available to the Council, and in particular we do not have separate dealings with the British national audit office. This office is completely separate from the Executive arm of government and its audit work retains its own confidences. LE du les ont bien voulu de d\u00e9bat. BUKHARI (Chairman, Finance Committee) (Original language Arabic): I do not have a great deal to add to what has been said. However, I would like at the outset to thank all those who have taken part in the discussion. I thank in fact all the members of the Council without exception. I would like to thank more particularly those who have expressed their satisfaction and their conviction for the contents of the Reports of the Finance Committee which in fact revolve around the basic immediate point under discussion during this session of the Council. I have a small comment to make here. This is a matter that was referred to by His Excellency the Ambassador of Italy, His Excellency the Ambassador of India, the Ambassadors of Colombia, Venezuela and others. However, as Chairman of the Finance Committee I wish to say that this Committee is not a Committee that simply reads documents. We are not simply there to sit for a couple of hours to read through the documents. We are a Committee that examines very carefully and in a very minute manner every minor and major item in the documents. We examine very carefully everything submitted to us. We then discuss matters, and we sometimes spend days discussing a specific subject if it appears to be necessary to do so. Some of the members of the Council may think that some subjects are discussed in an hour or so. But I would like to say that sometimes some subjects take up more than a day of discussion. So you can imagine how long we took to review the audited accounts of the FAO and the WFP or the Reports of the External Auditor. I would like you to know that such activities take days on end. We interview most of the officials in charge of the Organization, they sit with us and we put our questions to them and we listen to their replies, the External Auditor also. We discuss and examine with him every single paragraph of his Report and we listen very carefully to his answers. Both parties concerned, that is to say the Secretariat and the External Auditor, sit together and we discuss the whole matter between us. Then we, the members of the Finance Committee, express our opinion as far as the situation is concerned. We support one point or express our sympathy for another and so on. Therefore the activities and the operations of the Finance Committee are arduous. It is a Committee that is responsible here before the members of the Council. You, the members of the Council, are the ones who have established the Committee. We are the Council representatives before the External Auditor and the Secretariat, we are part of you and not against you. This Committee is composed of members who are known for their integrity, honesty and experience and they discuss all the documents and matters pertaining to the finances of the Organization to facilitate your task for you in discussing sensitive items. We are very proud that we represen t such an augus t body as this Council and we hope that we shall be worthy of the confidence and trust of all the members of the Council. Criticism is a single word but one that may have one or two meanings. We have constructive criticism, criticism with a subject and a point, and we have destructive criticism. Both sides of this form of as criticism. However, the criticizing criticism, destructive one. The members of the Finance Committee do not fear criticism but we welcome all forms of criticism to us by members of the Council. We simply wish that it be constructive and that it guide us in our activities. The Finance Committee r eceives its guidance from the Council and we are members of the Co mmittee. The majority of the members of the Finance Committee are also members of the Council. So we are an integral part of the Council. As I said, in the Finance Committee's report, the External Auditor provided us with information which was thoroughly examined. He provided us with this information in the form of a report. I believe that the Finance Committee must examine the auditor's report iself. It must not address the report in any different manner. -424- In the External Auditor's report there are no doubt certain criticisms, but are constructive ones. There are simplified forms of criticism in all the paragraphs of the report. For example, in paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10 the auditor referred to the weaknesses in the review operation in the planning of the budget and so on. As my colleague from Cuba and other colleagues have said, perfection is not something that can be achieved here. We in the Finance Committee can never achieve perfection. Perfection is a divine 10 of auditor's report says that certain points could be improved. This is an appropriate and a most courteous manner of addressing criticism. In sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph there is a statement which says that it would be better to monitor manpower. It goes without saying that this criticism is addressed to the Organization. In fact we questioned the Organization as to these points of criticism and obtained the n ecessary replies. I do not believe that the Finance Committee or any Member of the Committee, would expect us to submit a document of two thousand pages that would in fact contain all the questions addressed to the Secretariat and to the auditor, as well as the replies to these questions. Therefore, we submit to you a report in summary form that will facilitate the work of the Council. Once again I should like to express my deep thanks my unlimited gratitude to all my colleagues, Members of the Council, and I would simply urge them to be patient and calm, so that the discussion of these sensitive items be constructive, aimed at achieving the good of one and all. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I should like very briefly to set the record straight concerning one point that was made before lunch by the delegate of Colombia. In his intervention he made reference to the fact that Australia is on the Finance Committee, and as 1 understood it, he seemed to be implying we were raising criticisms that were not consistent with their membership of that Committee. I should like to say that Australia has worked hard on the Finance Committee. We take our responsibilities very seriously in that regard. I thought I had clearly indicated in my intervention, (if it was not clear 1 should like to underline it now) that Australia fully endorses acceptance of these reports and we appreciate the comments of the Chairman of the Finance Committee, and stand right behind him in this regard. What 1 did add, which might have led to some confusion, was only that we were impressed by the detailed work that had been done by several delegates to this Council (particularly the United Kingdom and Canada) that we supported their enthusiasm in looking at these details and that we would listen with interest to the responses of the Secretariat. I thank you for the opportunity to make that clear. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): S\u00f3lo intervenimos porque Colombia se ha puesto de moda en la reuni\u00f3n de esta tarde despu\u00e9s del almuerzo. Queremos, simplemente, agradecer de manera muy sincera al colega y amigo se\u00f1or Coutts de Australia por la declaraci\u00f3n tan positiva y constructiva que acaba de hacer. Creo que despu\u00e9s de este debate no tenemos duda de que el Consejo esta integrado por 49 constructores. LE PRESIDENT: Apr\u00e8s ces of the debate on these two items, there have been numerous references to the question of transparency. I should like to say that in the last resort the concept of transparency relates to a climate of confidence. I would like to reiterate the Director-General's intention of persevering in the road traced out in his own closing statement to the Conference, and by the discussions in the Programme and Finance Committees. If I may now be permitted a personal remark-I was both impressed and depressed by a number of interventions this morning. Impressed by the diligence with which certain documents, (in particular the reports of the External clearly been examined. I was depressed because frankly I have the impression that there was a systematic search for what I would call \"Sticks to beat the Secretariat\". However, I am rather encouraged to find that the sticks are not bigger ones. If I may continue my personal impressions, I think that if these are the most serious questions for which we can be called upon to provide answers, then the Organization is not doing too badly. I should like to answer two specific queries myself. The first relates to accommodation for the World Food Council. Here, the Executive Director of the World Food Council and we ourselves, are working to find a solution which will be satisfactory to both sides. Secondly, I should like to refer to a question regarding the use of the Italian Special Contributions. The representative of Italy expressed the view that it would not be appropriate for the Council to get into a detailed discussion on the use of these funds over the years since contributions first started in 1971. Therefore, I shall merely say that the Italian Special Contributions are all to be used for purposes agreed upon between the Italian Government and FAO. There are still some residual funds left from contributions in the past. We are in discussion with the Permanent Representation of Italy regarding the best use of these funds in the present financial situation. We hope that these discussions can be concluded in the very near future. On all other questions that have been put to the Secretariat, we shall be glad to provide detailed answers. With your permission, should to pass the microphone to Mr Dean K. CROWTHER (Assistant Director-General, Administration and Finance Department): First of all I have a couple of general comments to make before I get into the very detailed specific questions that were raised. I should like to take this opportunity to thank those delegates who have delved very deeply into various aspects and have Committee reports and therefore a continued interest in the Organization. I should like to reiterate the statement that was made by Ambassador Bukhari, (Chairman of the Finance Committee) and reassure the Council that the Finance Committee does look into every agenda item in great detail. Those of you who are Members, or have been Members, of the Finance Committee have seen the large stack of documents that are provided to each Member of the Finance Committee and additional explanation, analysis and work papers that are provided to the Members of the Finance Committee. It has been, and continues to be, the Director-General's instructions that we shall provide Members of the Finance Committee with all the information that your organization has at its disposal, that the Finance Committee Members ask for. We have attempted to do that in every meeting. I should also say that the Members of the Finance Committee very diligent business. I should like to mention also, for the benefit of Council Members on the question of contributions that there have been three payments received since we discussed this subject last week. There have been payments from Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Brazil. I am very pleased to announce that these payments have been received either in whole or in part each of respective countries. -426- Thirdly, in terms of general comments, I should like to say with respect to the external auditor that it is important as we view the external auditor's reports (which we do appreciate very much) that the external auditor has a basic responsibilitiy, which he carries out very diligently, and that is to review the accounts of the Organization and provide assurances back to the Council through the Finance Committee of their accuracy, completeness, and offer his opinion on their precision. The Chairman of the Finance Committee has made reference to the auditor's opinion which is included in the document that you have and again this past biennium, (as has been the case in all biennia) the auditor offered an unreserved, unqualified opinion on the accuracy of the accounts. By far, the work of the auditor is taken up for the most part by his review of the accuracy of the accounts during the biennium. 1 do not want Council Members to be misled in thinking that the only things the auditor does is to concentrate on the other items that seem to be of interest to the Council Members that are also included in the reports, because most of the work of the auditor is concentrated on the accounts themselves. Again, he finds them in good order and properly reflected in accordance with the Regulations of the Organization-that perspective was very important. In adddition to the time that the auditor has available to him, he then ventures into areas that he plans, and reviews management subjects that he refers to as \"value for money\". Those subjects that he had selected for the last biennium are reported upon, and as you have seen, where he has identified areas that he believes the Organization could improve he has either included the matter under a \"Conclusion\" or a \"Recommendation\". The distinction between \"value for money\" audits and the review of the accounts we think is a rather important one. If I can turn to the specific questions that have been raised, I think it would useful if 1 combined a number of the questions that were overlapping to the degree that I can do that, otherwise I shall have to go country-by-country. The first questions that were raised were from the representative of Germany. One of those questions had to do with the relationship of trust funds and cross-over to the Regular Programme. Mr Shah will direct an answer to that. The second question had to do with extrapolating from the personnel statistics the equivalent numbers of staff, and he had calculated a projected number of 7 962. That is a little high but it is very difficult to calculate. You have to take a number of things into consideration. One is that the personnel statistics that are shown in the reports that are in front of you include all of the authorized posts. In addition, we have attempted to take those contract employees who are on board and show equivalent numbers. Adding posts and numbers of equivalent employees together is not a completely accurate picture but it does give you an order of magnitude. We always have vacancies within posts, so the number is bound to be a little smaller than that project ed, closer to 7 000 than 7 900 odd, merely because of the vacancy rates and the turnovers, because you are dealing with posts in that instance. Next, the representative from the United Kingdom asked a number of questions, and I shall attempt to deal with them as precisely as we can. The first series of questions had to do with personnel matters and more specifically staff evaluations. He was concerned about how long there had been no system of staff appraisal for headquarters staff. Were our discussions on the introduction of an appraisal system likely to be finalized, and what do we do in the meantime? The Organization has a number of staff evaluation systems but they do not provide an umbrella system for the entire Organization. That subject has been studied by the International Civil Service Commission and in fact a pro forma appraisal system was proposed in draft form and attempted by most of the agencies of the UN system, but unfortunately it was so complicated that it fell of its own weight. The Civil Service Commission continues to study and attempt to find a better evaluation system that could properly be used by the various UN specialized agencies and the United Nations itself. However, that does not mean that we do nothing by any manner of means. We have a number of systems that are necessary for us to operate our personnel system. For example, we presently have an evaluation system that has concluded in a review of each individual's performance at the end of a probationary period. As we bring permanent employees on, these staff members serve a probationary period of one year and they are reviewed at three periods during that -427- first year in order to determine whether they should be continued. This system has existed for some period of time. Secondly, there is an overall staff evaluation or staff performance appraisal system for field staff. That, too, has been in existence for quite a long period of time. We are in the process of developing a performance system for each step in a particular grade level before the next step is automatically awarded. As the Council may be aware, the grading system in the UN system provides a number of steps for each grade. When a step is otherwise warranted we must have some indication from the supervisor as to whether they have performed well or not in order to be promoted. That evaluation system is being tested, and we hope to have that finalized in the very near future. One last point on evaluations: the question was raised as to how the internal that receive promotions are evaluated. Most of the promotions that we see within the Organization are as a result of filings for vacancy announcements that happen to Any staff member believing that they have appropriate experience and background to file for a particular vacancy announcement may do so. In so doing, they must receive an evaluation from the supervisor. The supervisor who has the vacancy and who has asked for the announcement receives all the various applications for the vacancy announcement. Then he must go through each of those evaluations that have been made by the supervisor and put forward to the selection committee his analysis of the various performance appraisals that have been made on each of those candidates. I think we have a performance evaluation for almost every condition. There are a few which are perhaps not completed, but we will continue to work with the Civil Service Commission in order to come up with a staff evaluation system that will be universal. Next, I should like to turn to the question that was raised on inventory control procedures for the Regular Programme. This related to the audit report on UNDP and the criticism that was made there with respect to our accounting for particularly fixed equipment in the field. On UNDP projects, like Regular Programme projects, we do have an equipment inventory that very precisely records from the point of purchase every item that is located in the field or in headquarters. The problem is that that inventory must be updated with a physical inventory on a regular basis. The auditor noted in those few cases where they visited the field that there were some instances when the inventory listing was sent from headquarters to the project for verification, but the organization found it difficult in some instances to get the project manager to take time out from the project to perform the inventory and return it to us. That is very true; it is a difficult task that we have to wrestle with. The auditor had some specific recommendations, which we have accepted and we have implemented, and we are attempting to find every way we can to motivate those people in the field to count the equipment. From time to time we do send internal auditors as well as other staff members who are in the programme area also to review the equipment that is there. We have an adequate set of internal controls over the equipment, but we accept the cr iticism levied and have instituted the action n ecessary to correct it. We have just recently-in fact, the automated inventory at the field. During implementation, we are doing a fairly complete test to make certain that we have all the bugs out of the system. We do believe, though, that this will provide the Organization with the assurance of an inventory control system that will be adequate. While we are on that particular point, a separate question was raised by the representative of Turkey concerning the receipt of the auditor's report on UNDP matters by UNDP. We certainly w ill continue to work closely with UNDP and make certain that their Governing Body has the opportunity to take up that issue as well. -428- The representative from the United Kingdom raised a question on the External Auditor's Report on the procurement of word processors. He dealt with a number of very specific questions that I should try and answer first, and I shall try at the same time to answer the questions raised by the representative from Canada. as to whether the manufacturer receiving the award of the contract was one of the three identified by the ISRC Committee. As the External Auditor's report shows, the particular manufacturer that r eceived the award was an addition to those three. When the Organization made a determination to go out for an international tender to buy word processing equipment, it selected a complete listing of qualified manufacturers, including three of the world's largest manufacturers. Each of these was not only a reputable company but provided good hardware, good software and the opportunity to maintain the equipment. Those were part of the substantiation that the Contracts Committee reviewed when they reviewed the list to go out for tender. The fact that an award was made to one of the bidders under the tender, a qualified bidder who was asked to tender who had not earlier been included in the consultants' report on this issue, we believe, and the audi tor also believed, was irrelevant. The important part was that when we went out to tender all the rules of competition in international tendering were followed very closely. I would like to assure you, Mr Chairman, and the Council that all of the rules for international tendering on this procurement were followed and the award was made in accordance with each of those rules. The auditor made it very clear that no violation had been made of any of the rules under the tendering procedure, and I might add that we have some very complicated and technical tendering rules and we must adhere to those very carefully. The Director-General is very keen about that and we are most conscious that we must follow those rules strictly. We have a Contracts Committee that reviews first the listing of bidders and specifications within the tender. After the tender is received there is a separate evaluation group that makes a full and complete evaluation of the bids received. The recommendations go back to the contracts committee who separately review the recommendation and make a final recommendation for the award. That procedure was followed to the letter in this case. It has been reviewed both by our internal auditors and our external auditors. The criticism that was levied by the external auditor on this particular case was that-even though the Organization selected an alternative bid that was received in the tender in a sealed bid at the same time as the other bids were r eceived, reviewed and evaluated through exactly process, recommendations were included--the auditor thought that the specifications for future tenders could be tightened up a bit and, while we do not disagree with him, he did not suggest that it was an inappropriate award and that the alternative bid should not have been considered. He did not suggest that anywhere in the report, nor in our discussions with him. So we can certainly reassure both the Council and you, Mr. Chairman, that the Finance Committee reviewed this in great detail, asking questions of himself, information necessary to the Committee on this issue. The question was raised as to whether any informal was made of the winning company's ability to perform under the tender. The answer is an unqualified \"yes\". A substantial appraisal was made. Both a technical appraisal was made and an economic appraisal was made and included in the results of the tender. The question that the auditor raised in this regard had to do with comparing the alternative bid which was substantially lower than the regular bids with the regular bids themselves. However, I am very pleased to say that an appraisal was performed of even the alternative bid. The question was also raised as to the level in FAO that a decision was made to waive competition tendering and at what level was this endorsed? There was no waiver of competition in this case whatsoever. This particular procurement was made under the rules of competition which exist for the Organization. There was no waiver of competition in any respect, neither did the Auditor suggest that there was any waivering of competition. Are there proposals to clarify the manual in the circumstances in which competitive tendering is not indicated? The manual does not need changes. It is a question of attempting to identify the specifications which most clearly will provide the type of equipment that you need in high technology where the state of the art is constantly changing. For example, if you have a particular problem in word processing, or data processing, which you wish to solve whether it is a hardware or software -429- problem, and you are going to tender for the solution, the tendering process requires a fairly precise set of specifications. The Auditor suggested that, it could be useful to the degree that we can make specifications even more precise. We accept that and we are certainly making every effort to do so in those areas where high technology is particularly involved. Have the recommendations of the Auditor been drawn to the attention of the staff concerned? The answer is an unqualified yes, it certainly has. Both our Procurement specific dates regarding the tender and I might refer to this, this particular procurement occurred in 1983. An international tender was issued to a qualified list of bidders on 18 November 1983. The closing date for the tender was 30 November 1983 and the bids were opened the next day on D ecember 1st. The purchase order was issued on 19 December after full and complete evaluation within the Organization. Therefore, there was not only cost evaluation, but also economic evaluation and technical appraisal I have answered the questions of the Representative of United Kingdom, perhaps with one exception. He did make reference to the format of the financial statement of the Organization and he thought that they were not in sufficient detail to provide enough information for analysis by the members of the Council. I wish to call your attention to the fact that we, together with the Board of Auditors and International Civil Service Commission, acting together with the CCAQ (the Consultant Committee of financial statements, the layout, format and the inclusion of information that is to be there, for all international organizations. We rigidly follow the directions that have been given to the Organization by the CCAQ and, whilst there are some difference between agencies, we all follow the same basic rules and procedures. There is no way we can all put out precisely the same sets of statements since our organizational objectives are a little different in each case. However, on a particular number of questions within the financial a degree and they are constantly discussed. The Board of Auditors also discussed this same question and tries to find basic ways of improving the financial statements that they can request of us. The Comptroller and Auditor General of the United Kingdom happens to be the External Auditor not only for the FAO, but for several other large UN organizations. They review the format and layouts in order that the members of Council and, more specifically, members of the Finance Committee, can have a complete understanding of the financial statements as they may wish to have. We have had an outside consultant to look at some of the details included in our financial statements, including subsidiary schedules which are there and we have recommendations for improving those. We w ill constantly strive to improve those and if there is any specific information in the audited accounts which you would like to see changed we would be pleased to receive your recommendations. With regard to the intervention made by the representative of Canada, I may have covered a number but not all of them. The Representative of Canada requested a general progress report on the implementation of our automated system, FINSYS/PERSYS. In view of the fact that the Finance Committee has heard detailed reports on this progress. I will not attempt to go into detail. We do plan to continue to report on this issue to the Finance Committee at every session, suffice it to say, we did tender for a development contractor to implement the automation of our complete personnel and finance system-we are developing an automated accounting system. The Organization -430- has long lived with a manual system which does need to be automated and whilst we have the basic specifications, and the implementation contractor now on board, under a fixed price contract, it is progressing quite well. We do expect that the contract will be completed both on time and within the dollar amount that was shown in the contract. The Representative of Canada enquired about the management group overseeing the development of this large automated system and how that differs from the Information Systems Resources Committee. 1 will only spend a moment on this to say that because this is a large automated financial management and personnel management system, we found it necessary to set up a steering committee of those persons who would largely be affected by this, to make certain that the contractor was developing the type of system in accordance with the contract specifications. That would be most useful, in that we would be able to implement the system on time. This group meets every two weeks and once a month we have a larger group who reviews it, and prepares management reports on it. The Internal Auditor sits as an observer on each of the steering committee meetings and we are watching, very closely, every aspect of this development system. There have been a number of systems in other organizations which have failed because they did not have good management attention on them. We hope this will not be the case in FAO. This group differs from the Information Systems Resources Committee in that the ISRC is a group of management officials, chaired by the Deputy Director-General, and consisting of the Directors-General to information systems development proposals by various technical organizations in the group. There is a technical sub-committee to that group who reviews the technical aspects and who makes recommendations to the full committee. a separate issue from overseeing the automation contract itself is a policy advisory group to the Director-General and does review automated systems development proposals. With regard to the audit reports, there may have been a number of additional questions raised by the Representative of Canada, which I did not cover. He welcomed an affirmation by the Secretariat, on our views that we would on can reassure you that the procurement system which exists in FAO is one of the best systems in the entire UN system. It has been reviewed by other UN organizations. Not only the automated portion of it, but also the internal controls related to it are well-established and well-founded. The External Auditor has reviewed the procurement system from time to time, as well as our Internal Auditor, and we find that we have got an excellent procurement system. I do not think it is the system that needs revising and it is not the recommendation of the External Auditor. In that regard I can reassure the Council and reaffirm that the procurement system is working well. The tendering system is working well and will continue to do so. We have certainly the recommendations into the recommendations that he has given to us. In respect of the technical point the Representative of Canada raised the uniformity of competition in this particular procurement of word processing and data processing equipment. The suggestion was made that we agree to compromise on a very early version of a local area network. That such network be placed in abeyance pending further study and that it be a substitute for 19 stand-alone units versus 4 units. The suggestions made were of an early version of such a system. I believe there may be some confusion over the terminology, but I do not want to dwell on the technical aspect. However, it should be mentioned that the 19 stand-alone units, which were included in the basic bid for word processing equipment, included precisely the same word processing units as we received under the alternative bid. They were the same equipment and the same specifications. The difference was a significant difference in price. Also, the difference was that instead of 19 units that would be connected individually to a reasonably small mini- computer, 19 of them around the house as one proposal was included, we accepted an alternative bid of 4 more modern more up-to-date and more powerful units than each of the 19. The combination of the 4 mini-computers which were selected in the alternative bid at a substantially lower price, gives us much more powerful capability than we would have received had we selected alternative of 19 mini-computers which would have been connected in individual divisions. We now have the opportunity of connecting them all throughout the entire Organization. It provides us, for the first time, in the history of the FAO, with the capability of putting information into one word processor and -13- it to printing, or other places, where during Council/Conference, and other sessions of this nature, such information transfers could be extremely important. We are in the process now of doing the final evaluation for the cabling that would be required to collate these together. After the full evaluation of that a proposal will be made to the Director-General and upon his approval it will be implemented. I think that 1 have covered the questions that have been raised, with the exception of either three or four that Mr. Shah should answer and there were a couple of questions on the World Food Programme that Mr. Ahmed should answer. V. J. SHAH (Director, Office of Programme, Budget and Evaluation): There are four subjects on which I would like to address myself to provide the clarifications desired by members reference to the Technical Cooperation Programme, I believe it was the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, who, referring to the transfer of $15 million from sa vings to the Technical Cooperation Programme, commented that this level of unobligated funds carried over into this biennium. It was in my first intervention at this session of the Council on Wednesday of last week that I tried to clarify the difference between unobligated funds of the TCP and commitments, commitments for projects which are approved. Now with regard to the $15 million which were transferred to the TCP specfically for the Agricultural Rehabilitation Programme for Africa, the full amount, and you may remember that this transfer was approved by the Finance Committee in May 1985, the full amount was allocated to projects for Africa, 94 projects in all. I have been reporting on this to the Finance Committee ever since. At the last session of the Finance Committee in September we reported to them on the actual delivery against the project earmarking and the delivery was, at the end of August, 70 percent. By now, at the end of October I would imagine it is a good 10 percentage points over that. I perhaps will not go into other aspects of the TCP since I gave information on that in my earlier intervention. The second point I would like to address myself to is the question of what steps are being taken to include and this question was raised by the representative of the United Kingdom with regard to our field projects. Project design, we have learned, as I am sure for other agencies and bilateral aid organizations, is really a key aspect in the efficient execution of a project and I do not know of one organization which can come up with a completely clean record and say that their systems ensured perfect project design in every case. In fact, our Review of the Field Programme, which members may remember as we submit it to the Conference every two years, gives extensive information on the project design as assessed by FAO representatives, as assessed by evaluation and the key is the effort made in evaluation and in feeding back the results of that evaluation into the process. This is something which requires effort across the board. It is not something that can be done only by a small group of people in one unit because it is the experience of field operations, conveyed to project operators in a central unit, whether of agriculture, or fishery or forestry operations, feeding back to the technical staff of divisions; that whole process is a dynamic one and it is based on a strengthening of our evaluation system. Now what has been done? I do not believe there is any question of my blowing the Organization's trumpet but there happened to be two reports of the Joint Inspection Unit which addressed themselves to this very point, among others, and both reports were considered by the Programme and Finance Committees at their September sessions. They are to in reports. The -432- reports themselves have been distributed as information documents of this Council. One is a report entitled \"Status of Internal Evaluation in Organizations of the United Nations System\" and the second is entitled \"The Third Report on Evaluation in the United Nations System: Integration and use\". The first report gives us, evaluation coverage, evaluation with other programme management in oversighted processes. I will not take the time of the Council in going into further detail but both these two JIU reports and the comments of the Programme and Finance Committees draw attention to what steps have been taken by the Organization in r ecent years to consolidate and streamline the evaluation system in order to ensure systematic feedback to improve the programme and project design. The third question which has been raised by a number of representatives is on the subject of programme support costs and reference has been made to the information on programme support costs included in the report of the Finance Committee of its September session. Here we are dealing specifically with the cost of delivery of field projects. There are two points I would like to make. Firstly that our cost measurement system gives us data which are the basis of our report to the Finance Committee and they are as they appear in the Finance Committee's document. These data are perfectly consistent in my view with the data referred to by the external auditor in his report. Reference was made to paragraph 9 of the external auditor's report of the regular programme where it is stated that \"Total support costs as later under the co st measurement system amou nted to 42 million 700 thousand dollars for UNDP, 17 million dollars for the World Food Programme and 39 million 200 thousand for Trust Funds. These figures are identical to the figures given in the tables under paragraph 72 of the Finance Committee Report CL 90/17. I refer to this matter because the intervention gave some impression of doubt or puzzlement or alarm that there is a Regular Programme subsidy to the Field Programme but this comes more as a surprise to the Secretariat, that there should be such puzzlement. I will not take the time of the Council by giving you an exhaustive history of the matter, but let me briefly recall that the question of project delivery cost for the Field Programme for field projects has been considered not only by the Finance Committee, and the Council and the Conference in the case of FAO, but by the relevant and related bodies of all other organizations in the United Nations system together with the UNDP governing council and the ACABQ, Advisory Committee Questions, and itself. All these considerations led to, firstly, an acceptance of the principle in the decisions both of the General Assembly, the UNDP governing council, and in our case, the FAO Conference in 1981, that there are certain charges which are applicable and are validly charged to project delivery, whereas there are other charges which are a valid charge to the regular budget. It was based on this principle that the FAO Conference in 1981, at its 21st Session, agreed that the support costs rate for the UNDP, as for Trust Funds, should be at a flat rate of 13 percent. In the case of the UNDP, as you know, there has been an interim period, until January 1987, during which we have received 14 percent, which was the former rate and in the case of Trust Funds there are also provisions for alternative rates or waivers, all established in the FAO manner. The last point I would address myself to is with reference to the report of the external auditor regarding regular programme monitoring and I would also refer to the views of the Finance Committee on this matter because in order to get the proper balance one has to bear in mind both sets of views and firstly, if I may make a personal comment, there is no reason I feel for me to be defensive, as some of the delegates have perhaps insinuated that the Secretariat may be at times, I am being perfectly open and frank on this subject. The external auditor himself recognizes and these things are said clearly in his report so I will not read them out, in order to save your time, but he says clearly that there is a comprehensive system of budgetary monitoring and planning with clearly documented responsibilities and so on and so forth. The Finance Committee agrees with that. Now when it comes to budgetary mo nitoring the external auditor made some suggestions about the need for -433- more detailed monitoring and we said, fine, improvements can, should always be made, but there was rather an emphasis on objective expenditure monitoring and here let there be no doubt, because there are some things which the Finance Committee recognized and which appear in the Finance Committee Report, object of expenditure monitoring is something which the Organization departed from from 1972/73 when it adopted the principle of programme budgeting. Of course, objects of expenditure are important. In order to formulate our Programme of Work we need to have building blocks, how much are we going to spend on staff, how much on travel, how much on consultants, but these are building blocks in constructing a programme budget. The whole emphasis of the programme of budget, and th is is all in the record of the Finance Committee and the Council and the Conference discussion in 1970 and 1971, was to say that the essential element, and I am quoting from the report of the Council at its 56th Session, \"An essentia l element in programme budgeting would replaced by programme controls\". There are many other references in the same vein all from the reports of the Finance Committee and the Council. The last point on this matter was that the Conference itself in 1971 changed the financial regulations specifically to provide for monitoring and transfers all to be done on a programme basis. One final point about work plan monitoring. There, as recognised by the External Auditor and the Finance Committee, we recognise firstly with some appreciation that the External Auditor commends us for the efforts we have made in the way the system is operating and has made some suggestions for improvement as the resources permit. We do not quarrel with any of that. Salahuddin AHMED (WFP): Certain points raised or referred to in passing by certain delegates with regard to the World Food Programme. They have been summarised in the statement from the delegate of Malaysia, Malaysia being a member of the Finance Committee. They relate to four points. One is nugatory expenditure of $ 3 million. Another one is not going into litigation against the contractor whose product did not take off. The third one is about the provision of food aid to a grain-surplus country in Asia. The fourth one is about losses in the food aid commodities delivered to another Asian country. All these items have been the subject of very thorough critical and constructive scrutiny in the Finance Department twice, in the ACAPQ of the UN and finally in the CFA that met only a month ago. Therefore a common membership will be fully aware of the discussions that went on there and the conclusions that are drawn. I must say that the discussions-and here I am particularly referring to the Finance Committee, since the Chairman and some members are present here-were very frank and very candid, and we appreciated it during the Session of the Committee and again recorded our appreciation for the understanding manner in which the Finance Committee looked into these matters. We have to look at this. I am talking about the management information system in perspective, and that is the perspective of growth, not in bulk or quantity but in quality. The nugatory experience of the World Food Programme, we view as a very unpleasant experience, a disappointment rather than an operational hazard path to from an operationally inadequate environment into a sophisticated computerised management information system. A little while ago my colleague, Mr Crowther, referred to high technology and the fast changing state of the art and implying there the risks involved in that. I must say, and I will be forgiven for saying this, that lucky are those who do not experience ups and downs in this march of technology. However, without repeating the words which are known to most governments present here and many delegates who were present at the meeting of the CFA or the Finance Committee, I think I will do best by referring to what the CFA finally observed with regard to both these matters, namely the -434- nugatory loss of that one about not going into litigation. In doing so the CFA has before it the Reports of both these advisory bodies, the Finance Committee and also the ACAPQ, and of course all of them have before them the Report of the External Auditor. The CFA mentioned this, and since the Report is not before the Committee, I am tempted to quote the relevant parts. system, the previous examinations of that issue by the FAO Finance Committee...\" (which is before the Committee, I add) \"...were referred Committee members agreed experience was unusual and that in several cases their own governments have experienced similar losses. \" This is a point that has already been made very clearly by the Finance Committee when the matter was first reported to you in another Finance Committee Session. I pro ceed: \"It was agreed that while the money spent on what turned out to be an unworkable system was to be regretted, the programme had learnt important lessons from its experience, evidenced by the successful implementation of the first phase in the management information system now in operation. \" It goes further, and here I add looking to the present not to the past, looking forward, and I quote again: \"The Committee noted found the operation technically sound, useful and flexible enough to allow for future expansion as needed. \" That is the nugatory experience. With regard to not going into litigation, I quote a very brief statement by Committee eceived a explanation recourse was not pursued concerning the contractor. It expert advice indicating that successful action he had decided to devote scarce staff and financial resources to moving on with system implementation on a revised and more sound basis, the outcome of which has been a successful operational system. \" Here I must add in document CL 90/17, paragraph 64, that was referred to by certain delegates, there is a very important comment made by the External Auditor when he appeared before the Finance Committee. The External Auditor observed that he was not expressing a view on the decision of the WPP management. I add that the management had to decide whether to get involved in litigation and waste its scarce resource, both in terms of manpower and in or It decided to move ahead and before you, Lastly, with regard to waste: expressed the support of the information system strategy and welcomed the Secretariat's is, the times-\"...in well as its in planning future developments.\" I hope this will satisfy the Council. In regard to the two other points, about supplying food to a grain-surplus country in Asia, first it must be recognized that food aid goes in the shape of project aid from the World Food Programme. All these projects, apart from the process of their preparation and scrutiny, are approved by the and in determines whether all the criteria applicable for eligibility for food aid are satisfied. They were satisfied and that is why food went there. Surely what the External Auditor is saying-and again I refer to paragraph 65 of document CL 90/17-is this: shall we carry food to a grain-surplus country, and he said we had better negotiate exchange arrangements-that is point number one-because already not only within the knowledge of the WFP as the right approach but we had already negotiated such a transfer, such an exchange before the examination of the External Auditor was available, and we were effecting that. But I must add here that exchange of commodities is not a very easy task at all. Yesterday while discussing the Report of the CFA to the Council, a point was made that we should think seriously and in appropriate cases about the availability in the food basket of non-cereal foods, such as vegetable oils and others. But it is not easy, it is a very difficult proposition. Even then, we tried it and we su cceeded to a point, and gave alternative commodities to that country. -435- The second point that the External Auditor made was that we should tackle the longer term position by evaluating the prospects of the country in attaining continued self-sufficiency. This is a vital point and it is a valid point and we have it very much in mind. I can tell the Council that in this matter of structural food self-sufficiency and food supplies we rely on the advice of the FAO. FAO has not found that this country in Asia is structurally food-surplus. This country is not also a confirmed food exporter. This country is not rich enough. This country has pockets of poverty and of poor people who otherwise would not have access to food either as part of wage or as part of incentive to certain community works without the help and the assistance of the World Food Programme. Also this country has been very generous in its contribution to alleviate the suffering in Africa during the recent crisis. So we are aware of this point, but there are full justifications when CFA approves a project for food aid for a particular country. My last point is about another Asian country, where the loss appears to have been stated by the delegate of Malaysia to be 30 percent. If we look at paragraph 51 of document CL 87/7 we will find that the situation is different. Even in that document we say in paragraph 51, page 10, that the average under-payment to workers fell from 13 percent in 1983 to 6 percent in 1984/85, and we reported to the CFA that according to our monitoring records during the middle of this year it fell to one percent and that was due to the combined efforts of the government and the World Food Programme. So that situation is a satisfactory one, though we are very much watchful of any developments through our evaluation and monitoring process and through continued search for improvement in the utilisation of food aid.

Nous l'en remercions et esp\u00e9rons me acknowledging the work carried out by our colleagues, the Chairman, the number Member sugge sted that the time was ripe for reflection over a longer term on the future evolution of FAO's role. This viewpoint is duly recorded in paragraph 197 of the Conference report. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Conference, His Excellency Mr. Yonke of Cameroon, in his address on the occasion of the closure of the Conference, summed up the feeling of that Conference that the time had come to look at the role of our Organization for the next forty years. He even suggested that the system of governing bodies be reviewed and that the Council should examine these matters during the next two years. May I confirm that the Nordic countries regard the function of the Programme Committee as very important. We have examined the two documents in front of us, CL 90/3 and CL 90/16, and listened very carefully to and However, any indication that the deliberation on FAO's future role, which is to us an urgent matter, is being initiated. In our view the Programme Committee should feel free to take up matters priorities and take decisions accordingly for further discussions in the other governing bodies. A few days ago, this Council embarked upon exercise of making so-called adjustments to the programme of the Organization for 1986/87. This was imposed on us due to the national legislation in one big Member State. None of us know the full consequences of such unilateral action. For a long period of time the Nordic countries have called for discussions in FAO concerning the future role of our Organization, including a debate around a more clear set of priorities. It is precisely to avoid an exercise such as the one we are now involved in, caused by a financial crisis, that we advanced the idea of discussing a more orderly process of arriving at by emergency situation. If such a debate is not governing bodies it will flourish outside in smaller groups and in other fora where not all of us may have the possibility of contributing. Setting priorities does not only more resources to up-grade activities or programmes. That is a pleasant task which everyone enjoys. No, the real challenge for scaled down maybe even terminated. -441- May I give an example of where is able to make a major contribution to sustaining a broad-scale development process with a long term impact. In some specific areas FAO should even be the lead agency within the UN. In the area of nutrition, the FAO has not fulfilled the task of lead agency. The Nordic countries have, for many years, urged FAO to play that role. As a consequence perhaps we should look to WHO as an alternative lead agency for nutrition. Cuts therefore could be made in FAO's Nutrition Division and it may be an idea to consider establishing a joint division with WHO, similar to the model used in the relationship between FAO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Maybe the same approach could be discussed in relation to the human resources sector, vis-a-vis the ILO. This, of course, could be elaborated in order to prepare themselves for the next sessions of Council and Conference. The formulation of more precise priorities must be based upon a clear understanding of the specific role of FAO in a more long-term perspective within the UN family and as a partner in international development cooperation. This refers to FAO's mandatory duties as a global organization for food and agriculture. However, it is even more important to reach an agreement on how FAO could best their developing countries as well as the donor community in the process of development cooperation. Over a time we have witnessed how an increasing part of the FAO's resources has been geared towards activities of a development cooperation nature. At the same time, we have experienced how the environment of, and the approach to, development cooperation has undergone considerable changes. This, to our mind, might not be duly reflected in the work of FAO. In order to allow us, as member countries, to exchange views on the future role of our Organization, we request the Directior-General to present, together with the Summary Programme of Work and Budget for 1988/89, to the Programme Committee and the Counc il, a specific issue. The of such a preliminary debate in the Council should then be reported to the Conference to allow the full membership of FAO to give their advice. We are convinced that all member countries will be to contribute, such an exercise. SRA.

Al dar nuestro voto aprobatorio y de confianza al Programa y todos sus Subprogramas, deseamos asimismo hacer algunas consideraciones sobre algunos de ellos que nos merecen particular atenci\u00f3n. Respecto al documento CL 90/3, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n revalida el marco program\u00e1tico de la FAO se\u00f1alado en el p\u00e1rrafo 9, considerando que la capacitaci\u00f3n, el desarrollo y la transferencia de tecnolog\u00edas apropiadas, el apoyo a la CTPD y CEPD en la proporci\u00f3n y modalidad que mejor convenga a los pa\u00edses, debe dirigirse a los productores y grupos rurales m\u00e1s necesitados. Este, en efecto, debe ser el objetivo fundamental de la FAO. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n apoya el Programa 2. 1 de agricultura y hace un llamado a la comunidad de donantes para apoyar al Plan Internacional de Suministro de Fertilizantes y para seguir apoyando multilateral y bilateralmente a los programas de prevenci\u00f3n de p\u00e9rdida de alimentos, desarrollo del cr\u00e9dito agr\u00edcola y mejoramiento de semillas. Respecto al Programa de Cultivos, nos complace el reconocimiento que hizo el Comit\u00e9 de la preocupaci\u00f3n que en todo el mundo entra\u00f1a la erosi\u00f3n constante de los recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos, y demandamos se contin\u00fae y acreciente el apoyo al compromiso internacional sobre recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos, ya que son esenciales para la prosperidad agr\u00edcola de los pa\u00edses desarrollados y en desarrollo. Otro de los programas a los que nuestra delegaci\u00f3n ha dado siempre el mayor inter\u00e9s, es el relativo a la promoci\u00f3n de los cultivos aut\u00f3ctonos, ya que \u00e9ste es el camino m\u00e1s efectivo para lograr la autosuficiencia alimentaria y la esperanza de erradicar el hambre en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Por ello damos nuestro apoyo al Subprograma 2. 1. 2. 2. Acontecimientos varios a nivel mundial ponen de manifiesto la importancia del c\u00f3digo internacional de conducta para la distribuci\u00f3n y el uso de plaguicidas. Esperamos, por lo tanto, que la FAO pueda fomentar su implantaci\u00f3n y que los pa\u00edses ofrezcan su mayor colaboraci\u00f3n y apoyo. -442- Al coincidir con el Programa de Ganaderia, no podemos dejar de mencionar que nuestra delegaci\u00f3n, apoyada por otras delegaciones, plante\u00f3 en las sesiones del COAG y en la Conferencia del a\u00f1o pasado, la necesidad de integrar todas las actividades relativas al sector pecuario en un comit\u00e9 que nos permita analizar todos los problemas del sector y darle el nivel de tratamiento que requiere. Durante la Conferencia Regional en Barbados, este tema se trat\u00f3 ampliamente, habi\u00e9ndose endosado la recomendaci\u00f3n para la creaci\u00f3n de un \u00f3rgano regional solicit\u00e1ndole al Director General realizara los pasos para su integraci\u00f3n a nivel global. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n le da gran importancia al Programa para el fomento de la investigaci\u00f3n y la tecnolog\u00eda, ya que el desequilibrio entre los grupos de pa\u00edses desarrollados y en v\u00edas de desarrollo y la repercusi\u00f3n en t\u00e9rminos de productividad, y por ende en precios, traen como consecuencia desalientos, falta de competitividad y dependencia. Conminamos a la FAO a que a trav\u00e9s de los Subprogramas respectivos, apoye el desarrollo tecnol\u00f3gico de los pa\u00edses, realice una selecci\u00f3n estricta de tecnolog\u00edas experimentadas, impulse la capacitaci\u00f3n y preparaci\u00f3n de t\u00e9cnicos y contribuya a la CTPD y CEPD para que la transferencia se d\u00e9 en forma m\u00e1s natural y efectiva. Asimismo, que se coordine de manera efectiva con otras Organizaciones, tanto del Sistema de Naciones Unidas como con otras agencias especializadas, ONGS, y con la asistencia bilateral para hacer m\u00e1s efectiva la asistencia a los pa\u00edses, y en particular llevarla hasta los grupos m\u00e1s necesitados. El apoyo a la capacitaci\u00f3n e incorporaci\u00f3n de la mujer deber\u00e1 ser un factor esencial, y en t\u00e9rminos generales la articulaci\u00f3n de este Programa con el de desarrollo rural, nos parece tambi\u00e9n acertado y le damos nuestro apoyo. Continuamos con el an\u00e1lisis de los programas, esta vez con aquellos presentados en el 51\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n se complace por la presentaci\u00f3n del Programa principal 5. 1, donde se hace un an\u00e1lisis de los cambios y ajustes que se han realizado para hacer m\u00e1s accesible y efectiva la informaci\u00f3n a todos los niveles, as\u00ed como las econom\u00edas que se han hecho o se pretenden hacer en materia de publicaciones y materiales audiovisuales. Apoyamos los enfoques del Programa de Pol\u00edtica, Dir ecci\u00f3n y Planificaci\u00f3n; felicitamos a las dependencias ejecutoras que han sabido adecuarse a las necesidades y demandas de los pa\u00edses de manera tan efectiva y transparente. A este respecto, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n considera que ser\u00eda recomendable contar con un sistema de cuenta por programas a nivel de pa\u00eds, considerando un prorrateo de gastos de la Sede, de la Oficina Regional y de las Representaciones nacionales destacando, por una parte, los recursos del Programa Ordinario y, por otra, los de Campo. Felicitamos y apoyamos los Programas de Asuntos Jur\u00eddicos y esperamos que expandan su labor de capacitaci\u00f3n. Concordamos, asimismo, con las recomendaciones del Comit\u00e9 respecto al Programa de Enlace. Respecto a los informes de la dependencia com\u00fan de inspecci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas analizados en ambos periodos, nos complace el reconocimiento del alto nivel del Sistema de Evaluaci\u00f3n interna de la FAO, as\u00ed como el reconocimiento a la FAO por los progresos logrados en la vinculaci\u00f3n entre los resultados de la evaluaci\u00f3n y el dise\u00f1o de programas y proyectos de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Respecto al \"apoyo del Sistema de Naciones Unidas para la ejecuci\u00f3n del Plan de Acci\u00f3n de Buenos Aires sobre cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica entre pa\u00edses en desarrollo\" nuestra delegaci\u00f3n concuerda con los p\u00e1rrafos 140, 141, 142 y 144, pero le preocupa la divergencia de opiniones del Comit\u00e9 expresadas en el p\u00e1rrafo 143 y conmina a que se trabaje m\u00e1s a fondo en b\u00fasqueda de f\u00f3rmulas que permitan dejar expresados en los documentos program\u00e1ticos la n ecesidad de incorporar este rengl\u00f3n para lo cual se d\u00e9 un indicativo del monto o percentaje para ejecutarlo Respecto a la cooperacion t\u00e9cnica de las Naciones Unidas en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, nos parece adecuado el an\u00e1lisis que se hace y esperamos que la FAO en su campo de acci\u00f3n lo apoye sustantivamente. Si bien en la documentaci\u00f3n relativa a este per\u00edodo de sesiones el \u00e1rea pesquera no est\u00e1 considerada, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n desea expresar su preocupaci\u00f3n porque los recortes presupuestarios no afecten a los programas emanados de la Conferencia Mundial de Pesca a lo que nuestro pais le da la mayor importancia y apoyo. Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n es, asimismo, una de las que m\u00e1s \u00e9nfasis le da a la utilizaci\u00f3n de los consultores de los propios pa\u00edses y de las reglones, pues considera que es una de las f\u00f3rmulas m\u00e1s apropiadas para lograr un mejor nivel de integraci\u00f3n. Por ello nos complace que se est\u00e9 incrementado el uso de consultores regionales y pedimos que se contin\u00fae en ese sentido. Asimismo, mi delegaci\u00f3n desea expresar todo nuestro apoyo para que las actividades de la FAO se ampl\u00eden, tanto en la capacitaci\u00f3n de grupos como en el proporcionar becas y viajes de estudio bien dise\u00f1ados y con profundo sentido en la selecci\u00f3n de los cursos y candidatos. -443- Coincidimos con el Comit\u00e9 en el an\u00e1lisis y recomendaciones formulados respecto a las actividades operacionales para el desarrollo contenidas en la Resoluci\u00f3n 40/211, y nos sumamos al pleno apoyo a las opiniones formuladas por el Director General. Esperamos que los generadores y las Organizaciones que manejan fondos apoyen a la FAO para mejor cumplir con las crecientes demandas de los pa\u00edses en su b\u00fasqueda de autosuficiencia y desarrollo en materia de alimentaci\u00f3n y agricultura. Aplaudimos la iniciativa del Director General y el trabajo del Comit\u00e9 en relaci\u00f3n con las medidas adoptadas para mostrar la transparencia en la labor de la Organizaci\u00f3n como medio indispensable para comprender, evaluar y valorar la labor de la FAO. Nos complace que en este aspecto haya habido el reconocimiento ya mencionado de la dependencia com\u00fan de inspecci\u00f3n, y conminamos a que as\u00ed lo haga tambi\u00e9n este Consejo. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): My delegation would like to thank the Programme Committee for its work and the analysis in the documents before us, CL 90/3 and CL 90/16. We can largely agree with the basic statements contained in them. We endorse the list of priorities drawn up by the Programme Committee as contained in para. 9 of the document CL 90/3. We, however, feel that the creation of incentives for farmers to produce more at national and, if necessary, also at subregional level is an important point which has to be included in such a list of priorities. The statements referring to programmes 2. 1. 1 to 2. 1. 5 show the efforts which are made to substantially strengthen and to develop food and agriculture by means of a wide range of specific measures in the most different fields. These objectives find our full support. Of special importance seem to us the promotion of small farmers, as stated in para. 15 of document CL 90/3, technical and fertilizers and organic resources, the question of mechanization, and animal questions. Questions relating to a closer coordination and cooperation in the research sector, but also between individual organizations of the United Nations system and at regional level in developing countries, are in our opinion of special importance. The strengthening of public relations work, proposed in paras. 6 to 28 of document CL 90/16, is to be welcomed. In general, however, we feel that in view of the existing financial situation the greatest possible economy postpone new activities until we know more about the financial situation. With regard to plant genetic resources (sub-programme 2. 1. 2) we particularly share the statements in para. 37, first tiret. In our view it is necessary to support the work of the IBPGR and to avoid overlapping with its work. As regards the development of an international information system on plant genetic resources, as mentioned in that paragraph, we would be grateful to the Secretariat for some more detailed information. Also in this connection a close cooperation between FAO and the IBPGR, as mentioned in para. 60 of the document, should be aimed at. We welcome what is stated in para. 54 of document CL 90/3 concerning the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides. I would like to point out that the compliance with the regulations of this Code is expressly provided for by the legislator of my country in the Plant Protection Act for the Federal Republic of Germany of 15 September 1986. With regard to para. 139 of document CL 90/3, work programme of the Joint Inspection Unit for 1986, we would have appreciated it if FAO had made still greater use of the services of the Joint Inspection Unit. We welcome the positive assessment of internal evaluation FAO, 90/16. We share the opinion expressed para. 152 of document CL 90/3, first sentence, according to which the operational activities in the United Nations system must be complementary and coherent. We are, however, not of the opinion that the activities of the Office for Project Execution (OPE) of UNDP duplicate th e activities of the other specialized agencies of the United Nations system in an impermissible way. These activities are in our opinion complementary to the other measures implemented by the specialized agencies. -444- With regard to para. 153 we recall that the short-term advisory services of UNDP and the Project Development Facility were established with the full support of the Governing Council of UNDP. From para. 155 of the document we cannot conclude that the coordination of development inputs in the UN system would only be provided for the sake of itself. We endorse the statements in paragraph 161 of document CL 90/3 which are aimed at a climate of cooperation based on confidence between Member Nations and the Secretariat. We feel that a further strengthening of transparency in the work of FAO must be a continuous process for our present and future cooperation. As I already had the opportunity to stress when we were discussing agenda item 12, dealing with the financial items, my delegation suggests that we all should make efforts to define the role of FAO and our own within the Organization in the future. I have thus warm sympathy for the ideas of the delegate uttered just before, that the Programme Committee should give some more thought to these substantial items of principle in its forthcoming work. K. Robin HIGHAM (Canada): It will be no surprise for me to tell you that my delegation has a detailed intervention concerning the work of the Programme Committee. The intervention reflects the work done in Ottawa by the three Ministries primarily interested in the work of FAO-that is, our Ministry of Agriculture, our Development Agency, and the Ministry of External Affairs. It expresses and elaborates Canadian concern at two levels. The first is, to what degree is the Programme Committee able to channel and is effective in channelling into the selection of FAO programmes and priorities. Secondly, how much longer is it practical, or fair even, for us to ask this Committee to deliberate on programmes and priorities with so little reference to the financial resources available to execute them. Well, I am going to spare you. I will not burden you with that intervention. But I want to assure members that our preparatory work under this item is well researched and as well founded and as critical-constructively of course-as the work done on financial matters. I regret that some have interpreted our remarks today as overly critical or unfounded. that reflect a profound malaise over a broad range of matters at FAO, not all matters by any means, then alas, so be it. In light of changing circumstances surrounding the world food and agriculture, and new problems emerging as a result of those new circumstances, we believe that it is important to constantly review the priorities and activities of the Organization. In the present circumstances we believe that such a review should focus on two broad areas. One is procedures for selecting priorities and activities at the level both the Finance Committee, the Programme Committee, COFO, COFI, C OAG, and even the Council-and at the level of senior management. Secondly, we think that the priorities and activities themselves need a closer look. Given Canada's enfant terrible status today, I do not want to detract from the Nordic statement by endorsing it, but it is a song I wish we had sung first. In particular we draw attention to the comments on the call from the Chairman of the last FAO Conference, the future role of the FAO, the need for application of new, original and modern approaches to development assistance, and the Nordic request for a paper from the Director-General on the subject of the future role of our Organization. I would like to endorse that request. The phrase 'selection of priorities' must show in the final Report of this Council, or I fear for our credibility as a responsible organ of this \u00e0 l'occasion de ce l'ordre remercie \u00e9galement le Secr\u00e9tariat pour la informations y sont contenues. L'examen des rapports de la cinquanti\u00e8me et de la cinquante et uni\u00e8me sessions du Comit\u00e9 du programme nous a permis de quelques avec satisfaction les efforts fournis par la FAO dans le sens de la production agricole, du renforcement de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire et formation, la mise point et le transfert des technologies, la coop\u00e9ration technique et \u00e9conomique entre pays en d\u00e9veloppement et sur faite au sujet du d\u00e9veloppement, de la recherche et de la technologie dans le document CL 90/3, qui lui consacre en fait pr\u00e8s de qui insiste sur la n \u00e9cessit\u00e9 de promouvoir la recherche agronomique dans les pays en d\u00e9veloppement et le rele que doivent jouer les \u00e9tablissements de des aussi le des efforts particuliers soient dans diff\u00e9rentes faire aux paragraphes 152 et du document CL 90/3, qui stipulent que certaines activit\u00e9s et services du PNUD font double emploi avec ceux de la FAO.

Je voudrais du Programme eu \u00e0 examiner le probl\u00e8me du la pas et, ne pouvons pas discuter sur ce sujet. Effectivement, le d\u00e9cidait le ne pourrait examiner la Je crois que, \u00e0 stade, faut le ce d\u00e9bat sur le rele futur de la FAO. On a dit qu'il ne fallait pas appeler cela une \"crise\", mais nous connaissons les difficult\u00e9s au Si ces sur rele futur de la FAO aboutissaient programme qui faire que l'on ait besoin de plus de ressources, je me demande si on serait en mesure de mettre cela en application. Programme. que je voulais dire, et que je tenais \u00e0 dire, avant de partir \u00e0 d'autres occupations; je \u00e0 donner mon point de sur cette question qui, je pense, a priori n'est pas SHIOZAWA (Japan): To begin with I would like to thank Mr. Mazoyer, the Chairman of the Programme Committee, for his excellent to carefully CL 90/3 and CL 90/16 which are before us. We would like to commend this Committee for having undertaken this overall review of the Programme in the field of agriculture, Information and documentation, the governing bodies and so on. Also we have read with interest the Committee's discussion on UN Joint Inspection Unit Report. Towards the end of document CL 90/3 under the item 'Any other Business', and transparency of FAO activities. -446- I would like to make some commente on these two issues. First, with regard to the coordination of operational activities for development efficiency of the activities of the various UM agencies, not only from the viewpoint of the individual agencies but also from the UN system as a whole. In this regard my country has attached much importance to the coordinating role of UNDP at the field level so as to avoid any duplication of operational activities for development on each UN agency and to make sure that these activities are complementary to each other. We appreciate very much role FAO plays through FAOR in such activities as indication of the need for food and agricultural development in the developing countries, advisory services, or the formulation of adequate development programmes and the monitoring and evaluation of the FAO projects. Nevertheless we sincerely hope that all necessary coordination between FAO and UNDP be smoothly conducted at the field level in light of the role of the UNDP recipient coordinator on behalf of the UN system with respect to the coordination of operational activities carried out by the UN system at the country level, which was reaffirmed in the preamble of the General Assembly Resolution 40/211. Secondly, with regard to transparency of FAO highly appreciate the initiative taken the create greater transparency in FAO's However, to that Programme Committee has taken one step further in saying that Committee could not a ccept any implication that might be a lack of clarity needed to examine the work of the Organization in paragraph 146 of document CL 90/3. Such a statement gives us the impression that there is no room left for greater transparency. We feel that there is room left for further improvement in this regard. I should like to use an example from TCP, since reference has already been made in paragraph 163 of the document CL 90/3 to the evaluation of TCP. I should like to draw your attention to the fact that when the report on the evaluation of TCP was given at the 88th Session of the Council, my delegation stressed once again the necessity to have information on the performance of the TCP projects provided with more intensity th an any other activities in the regular budget. I should not like to reiterate the reasons at this point in time. We did also point out that the analysis on the catalytical role of TCP was not sufficiently dealt with in the report made at the time. We hope that the Secretariat will pay due consideration to this matter. Before concluding my statement, I should like to refer to the comments made by the distinguished delegate of Denmark and other delegates. The content of its including a review of programmes, are quite meaningful and useful in the light of the present financial difficulties which this Organization is facing. We welcome the submission of such a report by the Director-General and the opportunity for all of us to consider this subject in the next year. Hermann REDL (Austria): We have studied very carefully the reports and 51st Session of the Programme Committee. I should like now to comment on document CL 90/16 and the work done by FAO under Major Programme 5. 1. The information in the document is efficient and therefore deserves our support. FAO's Information materials are well made remarkable centres and testifies the importance which is attached to the system. The establishment of the coupon scheme seems to be a good step to facilitate ccess to the primary documents. The Austrian delegation appreciates the future use of modern technology in the production of documents and publications. The two Programmes \"Conference and organized, efficient and of great help to all of us. Turning to Major Programme 1. 2-Policy, Direction and Planning, I express our special satisfaction with the work done under Programme Planning, Budgeting and in the UN System. The Austrian delegation of the activities under Major 3-Legal. However, it has to be stated clearly that the office needs the help of all member countries in providing it with the national cassettes and other texts of law. Let me now turn to Major Programme 1. 4-Liaison. With regard to the various existing organizations and the importance of collecting and delivering information from and to them, and taking into account the rapidly increasing flow of information, the Office of Inter-Agency Affairs could become more and more of a focal point for Information and coordination. -447- Concerning the reporte on the Use of Consultants and the UN Joint Inspection Unit Report No. 85/10, 85/11 and 85/9, we the views shown in document CL 90/16. I should also like to refer to the report of the FAO Training Activities. The Austrian delegation considers training is a central task of FAO and is fully aware of the importan ce of the development activities. My delegation supports to particularly the importance the distinguished delegate of Denmark, I should like to make the following comments. Austria is a Member of the Programme Committee and would like to draw your attention to Rule Ho. XXVI-7, pages 62 and 63 of our Basic Texts, where the functions of the Committee are clearly defined. We have within the COFO and parties which deal with sectoral priorities. The Austrian Government is fully aware of the importance of this matter. However, nearly each body of the FAO, including the Conference and the Council, is dealing with programme priorities. We believe that the Programme Committee has done excellent work, from what we can see in the reports in front of us. Therefore, we see no necessity to change the work of the Programme Committee and especially to change the rules of our Organization. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): 1 should like to welcome our Chairman of the Programme Committee, of which I am a Member-Monsieur Mazoyer. I hardly know where to begin, there is so much I would really like to tell you about. In my opinion, it is impossible for the Programme Committee to set policy at the time that we meet in September, without knowing what we are going to be faced with when all the reports have come in. There is a list of our priorities and we have set them out in some clarity (paragraph 9). It sets out a list of what we consider our most important priorities. There are other aspect s. I suppose each one of us has some \"bent\". I am sure you know what mine is, and I am happy to say that the Programme Committee (if you read it carefully you will find it) places emphasis on the small farmer, emphasis on what is going to be done for those people living, information that has to be geared to their way of looking at things, not to just Information for the serious and educated people and for the universities, not just the middle training information, but down at the bottom. Little booklets that can be handed out so that people can see what they are supposed to do when perhaps they are not able to read so easily. They can see with diagrams which are so clear. That is what we have emphasized in this Programme Committee-information and training which are two of the most essential things that FAO does, eight hundred and plus students a year in all levels of training and education. We are concentrating on getting more and more of the students from the developing countries so that we are not aiming at high pie in the sky, but practical matters that will help the people. I think that the emphasis that we have had on cooperation and supplementing CGIAR, 1 could not agree with you more. I think it was the Federal Republic of Germany that mentioned this part of FAO's work and it must complementary to IBPGR. We all know that that is what FAO does, and FAO has a small group of people who are intent on that kind of cooperation. However, I should like to say something to my distinguished colleague from the Nordic countries. One of the other things I have been doing in the Programme Committee is to try not to have FAO do what so many others are doing, which is to increase and increase and increase its fields. Nutrition was mentioned by the distinguished delegate from Denmark. Yes, FAO must be in touch with WHO, so we can get from WHO the nutritional \"lacks\" that are being found. However, FAO should not do nutrition research. They should get the crop that will service the deficiency in nutrition that WHO has the research to do. It is not FAO's business to get too far into that specialized field. FAO is supposed to be food and agriculture, and when WHO tells us that a certain nutritional defi ciency is shoving it us, yes-we find the crop and encourage its growth in the smallest towns of that particular area where that particular deficiency is showing up. However, we have got to, for heaven's sake, stop proliferating. We can get to be enormous. Mention has been made, and I do not like to take exception to the distinguished delegate from the Federal Republic of Germany, but I must tell you that if you read the Basic Texts of UNDP, it is only in the final last little line, where they have any permission to do any execution at all. The final little last line after a whole paragraph of what they are supposed to do is, in exceptio nal conditions they may execute. That it is \"exceptional\". What ar e they supposed to do? They are supposed to sit w ith a pile of money, in the happy position of listening to the government that is not happy, or to the executing agency that is not happy. They have the money and they say \"Look, I think you're wrong this time and I think the other one was wrong the other time\". They have an irreplaceable role. -448- What do I think is important about FAO? I think that Information is essential. It has got to be full, it has got to be disseminated. I am happy to say that JIU has congratulated and found that not all (they said) of the UN Agencies are doing the job that FAO is doing. This was on a previous JIU Report. It is praised for its dissemination and collection of information. I think training is extremely important as I mentioned already. Those are two other things, but what are they all for? If FAO takes its mind off that little person at the bottom of the line, those little fishermen going out in the boats, as was described to us not long ago, without any awning against the hard sun, and with no way of cooking. That is what is important, what is happening down there. In the Programme Committee this is what we are constantly trying to keep focused on. I know, and the Programme Committee knows, that I have sometimes found our language banal. \"We encourage, we support, we emphasize\"-all those things. That is a trifle compared to the real purpose of the programme. I have made only a few notes because maybe there is something in the long term. But what is it if it is not training and information and a better life, a better nutrition, a better food production for the people who are now living on this earth? I think we are trying to do it in our Programme Committee and I am proud to be a Member. Gabriel MACKO (Czechoslovakia): On the whole the Czechoslovak delegation has no objections to the adoption of the Report of the Programme Committee and agrees with the view that this Committee fulfills systematically the task of the programme review envisaged by the General Rules of the Organization. The socialist countries are not represented on the Programme Committee. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to touch on two questions to which the Report refers. Use of consultants 1984/85: in this the missed the fact that the of consultants from my country and other socialist countries is not proportionate to the high level of their technical and scientific institutions, their experience with work in developing countries and the reputation of their consultants. I should like to draw attention to the fact that their use is substantially and unjustifiably lower as compared, for instance, with UNIDO or WHO. Similarly, the question may be asked how many, out of th e average number of 58 000 trainees annually, had the opportunity of participating in training in Czechoslovakia or other socialist countries, and whether out of the 824 annual fellowship was awarded to the our has the oldest veterinary university with specialization in veterinary medicine, and a similarly specialized agricultural university, as well as a big cooperative training centre where a large number of both non-degree and post-graduate trainees from developing every year been sent by other organizations or on the basis of bilateral agreements. I should therefore like to recommend that due given question also be continued for a greater representation of women and young people in the FAO educational and training projects. Robbie Ma tongo MUPAWOSE (Zimbabwe): We thank the Chairman of the Programme Co mmittee for a clear summary of the reports before us in documents CL and CL 90/16. The documents are very clearly laid out and give confidence in the activities of the Organization. For a long time FAO has placed emphasis on crops and crop production. There has also been emphasis on fisheries and forestry. The area where we consider effort is needed is that of the livestock area. Here we draw attention to the breeding of both cattle and small stock, that is, goats, sheep, pigs, etc. They are not only important as food but also supply manure. I remember the States representative importance and value of manure which is obtained from some of these livestock. Also, we obtain milk, and there has been the question of nutrition being discussed; skins are obtained and very many other byproducts. The production and management of these animals requires that attention be given to be is need to coordinate with work being vigorously carried out and other related organizations. -449- Related to livestock production there is need to strengthen work on the preservation of crop residues. The Sub- Saharan countries generally suffer regular droughts, and yet no meaningful food bank programmes have been carried out. When droughts come, large numbers of livestock die, and in some areas livestock have to be moved long distances from one region to another in search of grazing or in search of stored food. In Zimbabwe we have been regularly examining the possibility of setting effectively implement this and we would hope to solicit assistance from the FAO and other organizations with both Information and additional techniques. Livestock production is of great importance to some of our countries. The use of animal draught power in our region, that is both oxen and donkeys, is of great importance. The use of the tractor and the cost of fuel becomes a limiting factor, of course. The appropriate use of these animals with the proper harnesses and adjustment of equipment gives very effective tillage. Work is being done in this area with the assistance of German aid, and we hope that further assistance from FAO will improve our efforts. The results of some of this research in our country and region can gladly be shared with other countries which use such equipment\u00b7 The export of beef, both from Botswana and Zimbabwe, is of great economic value. This entails more costs in continue. Any due to of cattle in the slaughterhouses should not be allowed to take place. On the issue of consultants, while a beginning has been made in the use of regional and local African consultants, we feel there should be an increase in the use of this manpower. Overseas consultants are not always the most useful. They demand a lot of time from local officials, both technicians and professionals. They arrive and have to be educated and reorientated to local conditions before they begin to ask questions. Of course, there are many very good and experienced consultants, but it has taken much time of some of the local people to bring them to that level of expertise. We believe that the continued use of local consultants can also help to develop a pool of manpower and a pool of expertise in these developing countries which can have long-term Committee with interest, and we commend the Committee for the considerable work it has done in assessing the various and widespread activities of FAO. We were interested to see in the 50th Report a thorough statement of the objectives of the various programmes. We found this most useful. We were also pleased to see in the 51st Report that considerable attention is being given to programme evaluation and review. We regard evaluation as an essential part of programme management, especially in times of severe strain on overall resources, and we support as mu ch attention as possible being given to this aspect not only to objectives of programmes but to the measurement and assessment of how successfully these objectives have been achieved, that is, to the impact assessment of programmes. I must confess that when the reports refer to the evaluation of programmes 1 am not absolutely certain what is meant by that, and I should like to ask the Secretariat if evaluation of programmes means that we are also pleased to see recognition in paragraph 10 of the 50th report of the need for priority setting in the context that resources available will never fully match the requirements of member countries. We also note the points in paragraph 9 mentioned by the United States Ambassador regarding areas that the Committee feels should be in has become much more important since the 50th Report was prepared some six months ago. While the need for priority setting is now undeniable, unfortunately the reports in front of us address only areas that should be given greater priority. The of is not addressed. In saying that, I would not wish to be misunderstood. I understand the difficulties of doing the second task, but it is one that faces us nevertheless. For these reasons, we give strong support to the suggestion by the Nordic countries that a paper be for the Committee and for later consideration the Council Conference that addresses the question of programme priorities. the the Committee's comments on transparency within FAO. We appreciate that this matter was considered, as my delegation attaches some importance to it. The praise given by the Committee to the Director-General and the Secretariat is quite remarkable. We have seldom, if ever, seen such an unstinted vote of confidence in the transparency of information systems for any organization. As part of this strong vote of confidence by the -450- Committee, we are just a little uneasy when we look closely at the report in this regard. We do not question the willingness of the Secretariat to supply information on request, and we fully agree with the Committee's observations that member countries must pay attention to the reasonableness of their inquiries and the the information produced in the normal course of events and the systems in place. In that context, we feel that there may still be some room for improvement. Several examples that have already come up at this meeting spring to mind. These include the availability of information on actual expenditure during the biennium by the Organization; the Secretariat's comments on issues, but can only observe that the continued concerns of some members suggest that either there is a transparency problem of some nature or there is a problem of understanding between delegations and the Secretariat. To the extent that doubts on such matters remain, we urge that they be looked at again by the Programme and/or Finance Committees. We note the comments regarding the use of consultants from a wide by Czechoslovakia a few minutes ago. In principle, we have absolutely no difficulty with this approach provided that it is followed in a manner that is consistent with selecting as high a level of expertise on particular issues as possible. In the fiftieth report we noted the Committee's concern, in paragraphs 151 160, over with the UNDP, especially in relation to the activities of the Office for Project Evaluation (OPE). We feel that it is most undesirable for these two bodies to be working in a way, which is not fully harmonious, and which would appear to involve some overlap in activities. We should be interested to know more about what action has been taken to resolve these problems and what the be. Finally, we would once again underline that the work of this Committee, as with the Finance Committee, is of critical importance in the troubled times ahead of us. We feel that greater attention will have to be given at its next meeting to the unenviable task of setting some programme priorities to match the Programme of Work to the resources available. To this end, the work of this Committee must link closely with that of the Finance Committee. It may be appropriate to consider if the two should at observations, Australia would not oppose acceptance by the Council of these reports. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sin duda, se\u00f1or Presidente, el Consejo tuvo un gran acierto al elegir al se\u00f1or Mazoyer, de Francia, como Presidente del Comit\u00e9 del Programa, ya que todos sabemos la manera tan competente como \u00e9l viene cumpliendo su alta responsabilidad. La presentaci\u00f3n del se\u00f1or Mazoyer ha hecho que los informes del Comit\u00e9 del Programa faciliten nuestra actitud en el sentido de apoyar completamente esos dos informes a trav\u00e9s de los cuales tenemos la convicci\u00f3n sincera de que no hay ning\u00fan problema de transparencia en cuanto a las actividades de la Organizaci\u00f3n, cuya Secretarla suministra todas las informaciones razonables que se le solicitan y estoy seguro de que si existe, como se ha dicho, cualquier problema de comprensi\u00f3n entre la Administraci\u00f3n y ciertos respetables representantes, todo ello ser\u00e1 superado con buena voluntad y mutua comprensi\u00f3n. Admiramos siempre las elocuentes y sentidas declaraciones de nuestra colega y amiga Millicent Fenwick, Embajadora de los Estados Unidos y aficionada miembro del Comit\u00e9 del Programa. Apoyamos lo que ella ha dicho en cuanto a los peque\u00f1os agricultores y otras inquietudes humanas y sociales porque la se\u00f1ora Fenwick, a quien nosotros admiramos mucho en sus declaraciones, particularmente cuando ella habla con su mente y con su coraz\u00f3n, y no con el telex de W\u00e0shington. Nuestro colega y amigo el se\u00f1or Winkel, de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Alemania, plante\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n algunas ideas que son interesantes y que esperamos se tengan en cuenta. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia est\u00e1 muy agradecida a nuestro colega y amigo de Dinamarca. La intervenci\u00f3n de nuestro colega Kristensen de esta tarde, nos ofrece la oportunidad de volver un poco hacia el pasado. Acerca de lo que se ha dicho en el seno de esta Organizaci\u00f3n en materia de las revisiones que ahora en cierta medida proponen, la \u00faltima revisi\u00f3n org\u00e1nica, si asi pudi\u00e9ramos llamarla, de las prioridades de los m\u00e9todos de trabajo y de la estructura de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n, se realiz\u00f3 en 1968, inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de que la Conferencia de 1967 eligi\u00f3 al se\u00f1or Boer ma, Director General de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Se constituy\u00f3 un grupo ad hoc , integrado por siete de cada una de las regiones de la FAO, grupo en el cual el se\u00f1or kristensen, ahora Director Jefe de la Delegaci\u00f3n de Dinamarca, particip\u00f3 activamente. Al se\u00f1or Kristensen me une, antes de esa fecha, una amistad de colegage, porque ambos participamos en el entonces Comit\u00e9 Intergubernamental del PMA que \u00e9l presidia y en el Comit\u00e9 del Programa, del cual yo fui su Presidente. -451- Pensamos sinceramente que las propuestas de Dinamarca son positivas y constructivas y corresponden al esp\u00edritu altruista y generoso que caracteriza a los pa\u00edses n\u00f3rdicos y que los representantes del gobierno de Colombia exaltamos continuamente. Igualmente estamos plenamente de acuerdo con nuestro colega y amigo Higham, del Canad\u00e1, en el sentido de que las circunstancias cambiantes imponente a la FAO la necesidad de adecuarse continua y progresivamente a las formas m\u00e1s din\u00e1micas, incisivas y actualizadas como nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n debe afrontar el estudio y la soluci\u00f3n de los problemas. Sin embargo, mi vecino de la derecha, ahora ausente, el embajador del Congo hizo una declaraci\u00f3n sensata y reflexiva en la cual se refiri\u00f3 a la incertidumbre actual, que podemos llamar crisis, porque el embajador Pascarelli ha dejado la sala, y ello nos induce a pensar que tal vez no conviene ahora en este momento agregar otra inquietud m\u00e1s a todas las que ya nos causa esta dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n, pero s\u00ed pensamos que la Conferencia de noviembre 1987, sobre todo al estudiar el Programa de Labores y Presupuesto para 1988/89, puede ser una oportunidad propicia para considerar cualquier posibilidad a ese respecto; porque convendr\u00e1 recordar tambi\u00e9n que despu\u00e9s de la que he llamado revisi\u00f3n org\u00e1nica de 1968, en 1976 inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de la Conferencia de 1975 en la cual se eligi\u00f3 un Director General, en 1976, repetimos, co mo ya lo dijimos en la discusi\u00f3n del tema 4, hubo una reuni\u00f3n del Consejo que convenimos, a la luz de los textos b\u00e1sicos, en que no deb\u00eda llamarse \"especial\" pero que s\u00ed fue excepcional porque se reuni\u00f3 en julio de 1976, o sea en a\u00f1os pares, cuando generalmente el Consejo en esos a\u00f1os pares s\u00f3lo se re\u00fane en noviembre. En ese Consejo de julio de 1976 y luego en el Consejo de noviembre de ese mismo a\u00f1o y en la Conferencia de noviembre de 1967, en ese ciclo que hemos citado, los estados miembros todos de la FAO coincidimos, aprobamos ciertas directrices que estaban contenidas en los programas y pol\u00edticas que nos present\u00f3 el nuevo Director General y que contaron con el apoyo un\u00e1nime de todos los representantes de los gobiernos. De manera que pensamos, para resumir, debemos ir, al Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n con que posiblemente la Conferencia de noviembre de 1987 puede ser el escenario indicado para considerar la posible n ecesidad de revisar las prioridades, los m\u00e9todos de trabajo y la estructura de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n, y mientras tanto los dos \u00f3rganos asesores m\u00e1s importantes del Consejo, los Comit\u00e9s del Programa y de Finanzas, deben intensificar sus tareas en ese campo dentro de los par\u00e1metros, los t\u00e9rminos de referencia de esos Comit\u00e9s que ya fueron citados adecuadamente por el colega Redl, de Austria. El colega y amigo Coutts, de Australia, ha sugerido la conveniencia de que los Comit\u00e9s del Programa y de Finanzas se re\u00fanan conjuntamente. Como dije antes, yo fui Presidente del Comit\u00e9 del Programa y antes miembro tambi\u00e9n, y por ello creo que sigue vigente la disposici\u00f3n seg\u00fan la cual esos dos Comites celebran por lo menos una reuni\u00f3n conjunta a principios de los a\u00f1os impares, cuando por primera vez estudian el proyecto del Programa de Laboree y Presupuestos. La se\u00f1ora Fenwick, que es miembro del Comit\u00e9 del Programa, asiente y esto confirma ml aseveraci\u00f3n. De manera que todo va bien, las circunstancias continuaron cumpli\u00e9ndose dentro de ese marco y veremos m\u00e1s adelante qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1 necesario realizar, pero por ahora pensamos que no es necesario introducir ninguna modificaci\u00f3n. Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (original language Arabic): On behalf of my delegation it is my pleasure to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Mazoyer, Chairman of the Programme Committee his clear presentation of the two documents under discussion. We wish to express our satisfaction for the interest which the Organization has shown in supporting TCDC, in meeting the needs of the various agricultural interest in farming, assisting and the training of personnel. On this basis we fully support the programme: Agriculture and the sub-programmes on crops and rural development. should also commend the Organization's activities aimed at s upporting anima institutions Africa through the programme entitled \"Livestock\". We are pleased to see that the Organization has also been interested in the social aspects of development programmes in view of enforcing the team spirit amongst workers through the publication of \"Workers its increase public awareness of the activities and objectiv es of the Organization through the publication of \"Ceres\". Document CL 90/16 refers to the increase of consultants from developing countries in 1984/85 compared to 1982/83. We are pleased to note this. However, we request the Organization to increase the number of consultants from the Near East region. We also welcome the increase of contracts with research institutions in developing countries. My country had the honour of introducing the Arabic language as a working language in the Organization and we are pleased to see that Lebanon has asked for its use in AGRIS and CARIS. We fully support this suggestion. -452- After seen the interest of programmes all countries we can but commend the efforts of the Director- General in establishing the general guidelines of these programmes. Ronald F. R. DEARE (United Kingdom): Could I perhaps begin by thanking Mr. Mazoyer for his very full and informative introduction. I think all of us who have read these reports realize the amount of hard work that is put in by members of the Programme Committee. I would like to join those who have proceeded me in commending the representative of Denmark for a statement on behalf of the Nordic countries. There is much that 1 could say about that statement but I think I will simply confine myself to saying that my delegation certainly endorsee the call that he has made for a paper to be put to the Programme Committee and to the Council on the future role of FAO with particular reference to the setting of priorities and I am happy to say in view of what was said in the Nordic statement I have been able to shorten my statement quite considerably, but there is one point which I would wish to make in regard to the role of the Programme Committee, in regard to the setting of priorities\u00b7 As I read it it is part of the function of the Programme Committee as set out in the General Regulations and, despite the eloquent intervention of my friend and colleague from the United States, who unfortunately is not here now, I still must say it remains the feeling in my delegation, that this critical function seems not to have formed a significant part of the review; for example, a major programme 2. 1 Agriculture, which is reported extensively in document CL 90/3. At a rough count, there are some 70 instances in this report where the Committee has urged further of priority of, or priority programmes, or particular activities and has affirmed or stressed the need for others. I have not been able to find one instance where the Committee has suggested that even programme or ac might or believe that it would be helpful to members of this Council if the Programme Committee were able perhaps to pay greater attention to critical function, but I do recognize the problem, particularly when examination of the programme is divorced from the responsibility for finance. So perhaps, as has already been suggested this afternoon, it may be the time to consider, and dare I say this, the merger of the two committees so that the one committee deals with both vital aspects of the activities of this Organization. Perhaps this might be something for consideration for inclusion in the paper which has been requested by our friends, the Nordic delegation. Finally, I had intended to speak at some length on paragraph 151 to 160 of document CL 90/3 on operational activities for development, but in view of the lateness of the hour, I will simply confine myself to say for the record that my delegation cannot subscribe to the points made in paragraphs 152 to 156 of that document where they conflict with decisions taken (UNDP): I am very grateful for your indulgence. I have listened with great interest to the intervention on the agenda item before us. The UNDP acquainted itself with the document 90/3 specifically under paragraphs which are relevant to UNDP, 151 to 160. As you may recall, the comments of the Programme the commented on the comments of the Programme Committee of FAO. I will read the same comments which were read out at the ECOSOC Meeting on behalf of the UNDP. Concerning the Projects Execution, about which the Committee \"expresses serious concern\", I wish to point out that the 1970 consensus does not foresee the automatic designation of the specialized agency as an executing agency merely by virtue of of agent is sources of experience outside the United Nations system. A large part of the projects executed through OPE provide this additional source of experience existing sources technical projects funded by UNDP's central resources has remained constant under 7 percent over the past four years, and that the great majority of the projects are government executed while the role of OPE is reduced to merely providing governments with some specific services whenever they need them and whenever they request them. Thus it promotes and encourages the ultimate goal of the recipient governments, self-reliance. As you can see, the executed projects by OPE are not at all the traditional projects execution type, from those executed by the specialized agencies. It should also be pointed that in so-called projects of multi-sectoral character executed by which was established by the UNDP Governing Council on an experimental basis last year, the Council at its last session extended the facility for another year. The administration has informed our executing agency partners of the purposes and procedures of this facility, making it very clear that agencies are entitled to participate in the use of PDF resources for project preparation. PDF is a supplementary source of financing not exclude existing projects. many delegations in July is year have the short-term advisory services established by Governing Council last year. Under this service, UNDP acts as a clearing house expertise. in any way with existing mandates or activities of United Nations system I guess that the distinguished members of the Committee had in mind UNIFEM, which is the acronym for the United Nations Development Fund for Women. You may recall that this fund was created not by UNDP, but by the General Assembly of the United Nations with its resolution 31/133 of 16 D ecember 1976, originally as the Voluntary Fund for the UN Decade for Women. The Fund became operational in 1978. In 1984, the General Assembly in resolution 39/125 decided that the activities of this Fund should be continued by the establishment of a separate and identifiable entity in autonomous association with UNDP. UNIFEM is a and not an executing agency, which uses existing capacity in the United Nations system, including FAO, to execute projects. For example, at the present time, ten projects funded by UNIFEM are being executed by FAO. I am sure there are more now because my information is not updated now. Concerning the roundtable process, its proposed that express wish of governments to improve this mechanism by, inter alia, limiting the participants in the roundtable conference itself to the recipient and major donors. However, as explained in the report session (DP 71986/17), consultations constitute a major element in the new roundtable format. For this part of the consultation process, have priority involvement, indicates that preliminary experience with substantive participation of this respect, have proven to be quite satisfactory. Just to mention a few related to FAO: its involvement in The Gambia for consultations in the agricultural and fisheries sector, as well as in Benin, for consultations in the forestry and rural development sectors, along with its involvement in Burundi, for consultations in fisheries and food crop sectors. As you have heard on previous occasions by the secretariat of FAO itself, there are ongoing processes of contacts and negotiations between two FAO and UNDP in further enhancing the participation FAO in We that though UNDP is the the UNDP representative is not participate in the Programme Committee, significant discussions take UNDP/FAO cooperation. Had we been allowed to participate, the points which I have made in response to the Programme Committee's comments which were at the Council would have been explained on the spot at the meeting. I am not able to respond to all the comments which were made by the delegates here in the Council but I hope that the general comments which I made on the comments of the Committee are giving some light Mirza KHALEELI have the honour to thank Mr. Mazoyer, our Chairman, for the excellent Report. I had the benefit of participating in the Twenty-First Session and to me it was most educative, both the manner in which it was conducted and the manner in which information from the Secretariat was elicited on all matters where there was some doubt and where importance was attached to programmes. I was not present at the Fiftieth Session, but I would like to assure all those who are not members of the Programme Committee that for the best part of a week, there were very detailed discussions and a rare unanimity under the very careful guidance of Mr. Mazoyer. The emphasis on information and training, which are two priorities mentioned by the charming delegate of the United States, was very evident. I would also like to mention that the consciousness of the need for economy, even on small matters, was discussed more than once, even though it was not the Finance Committee. -454- There were certain aspects of publicity where we found that some of the documentation was extremely glossy and certain other types of publications which were very useful to the general public. It was made clear to us by the Secretariat that their main role was to inform the informers, the people who train the public, and FAO could not go around distributing useful pamphlets to the general public. There is a reference to this in document CL 90/16, paragraphs 15, 27 and 44. Regarding the rather raised by important think a view might have to be taken at some stage as to what is the role of the Programme Committee, not only in the context of the financial constraints that the Organization faces but in the context of reviewing programmes and priorities. But for the time being, I think the point made by the delegates of Congo and Austria and others, including Colombia, is that the evaluation of the rules and practices being what they are, we are I believe constrained to discuss the Report of the are entitled to go into the actual functioning of the Finance Committee and the Programme Committee, (and of course delegations can things), it becomes rather difficult mid-course for priorities in agriculture and agricultural policy which have been set by the Conference, to be altered. Almir F. de S\u00e1 BARBUDA (Brazil): the in Mr. Mazoyer for the comprehensive introduction of this Item of the Agenda. We also wish to reiterate our interest in the work of the Programme Committee and to present our support for the review of FAO's programmes, to the findings and recommendations of the Fifty-First Sessions of the Programme Committee. We would like to thank once again the for having brought to the Programme Committee, as the Finance Committee, the subject of greater transparency in the work of the Organization. His initiative has been rightly appreciated by the Committee, which praised the nature and the extent of the information available. We agree with what has been said by Ambassador Bula Hoyos that there are really no problems of transparency in this Organization and information has always been provided by the Secretariat. We appreciate the attention that has been given in both Sessions to the issues of training and economic and technical cooperation among developing countries. In relation the observations and suggestions presented at paragraph 109 of document CL reiterates its support for the TCDC activities laid down by the Buenos Aires Plan of Ac tion and FAO's approach to TCDC. We therefore support paragraphs to of document CL 90/3. My delegation wishes to congratulate FAO for the recognition by the UN Joint Inspection Unit of the high standing of its internal evaluation system within the UN system. We also wish to mention our appreciation with regard to the increase of 7. 9 percent in the use by FAO of individual consultants from developing countries and we hope that this percentage will further increase. Finally, we want to give our full support to the points raised by the Austrian delegate in relation to the proposal from Denmark. At this point we do not see any need for definitions or new reviews of functions of FAO bodies, functions which are very clearly defined in the Basic Texts . increase indefinitely. Finally, we want to express our support for what has been said in this regard by Ambassador Bula Hoyos of Colombia, the Ambassador of India and other delegates. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n agradece la presentaci\u00f3n de los documentos CL 90/3 y CL 90/16 hecha en forma magistral por el se\u00f1or Mazoyer, Presidente de dicho Comit\u00e9. Asimismo, encomiamos la labor hecha por los miembros del Comit\u00e9 para presentarnos un documento dirigido especificamente a las actividades principales que debe ejecutar esta Organizaci\u00f3n y considera mi delegaci\u00f3n que para preparar el mismo se han tenido en cuenta las prioridades as\u00ed como la situaci\u00f3n financiera de la Organizaci\u00f3n, cuesti\u00f3n muy importante en estos momentos a tener presente. Consideramos, Sr. Presidente, que el haber elegido nosotros este Comit\u00e9 de Programas, nos respetamos nosotros mismos por haber depositado en sus miembros la confianza necesaria para la ejecuci\u00f3n de su labor, confianza que adem\u00e1s merecen. En tal sentido, mi delegaci\u00f3n considera que estos informes deben ser aprobados por el Consejo. Quisi\u00e9ramos referirnos, sin embargo, a algunos aspectos que si bien han sido recogidos por el informe, ameritan que se haga hincapi\u00e9 en ellos, una especie de selecci\u00f3n de intereses. En el p\u00e1rrafo 9 del documento CL 90/3 se recogen los aspectos m\u00e1s importantes en que el Comit\u00e9 consider\u00f3 que la FAO debe hacer \u00e9nfasis y que mi delegaci\u00f3n apoya en -455- todas sus partes como son, por su importancia, la capacitaci\u00f3n a todos los niveles, el desarrollo y transferencia de tecnolog\u00edas apropiadas y el apoyo a la acci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y t\u00e9cnica entre pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Sin embargo, repito, consideramos que, por la importancia que tiene, debiera hacerse alguna alusi\u00f3n directa en la globalizaci\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n de todos estos grandes programas, a la participaci\u00f3n de la mujer en estas actividades que son actividades priorizadas, y que en todas ellas participa la mujer en una u otra forma y que debemos intensificar su participaci\u00f3n. Entendemos tambi\u00e9n que los programas especiales de acci\u00f3n de la FAO verdaderamente revisten considerable importancia para el sostenimiento o aumento de la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y alimentaria. Sin embargo, nos par ece muy necesario que se eval\u00faen peri\u00f3dicamente sus resultados a la luz de las necesidades de los pa\u00edses y las posib ilidades reales de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Para nosotros es muy importante las evaluaciones peri\u00f3dicas que son las que garantizan que no nos mantengamos durante a\u00f1os discutiendo las mismas situaciones. Adem\u00e1s, nosotros quisi\u00e9ramos puntualizar en los cultivos, nos gustar\u00eda puntualizar el subprograma 2. 1. 2. 1 \"Recursos gen\u00e9ticos\". Son cuestiones que nosotros consideramos estrat\u00e9gicas en el desarrollo del trabajo de la Organizaci\u00f3n. Por consiguiente, es muy importante el p\u00e1rrafo 60. Con respecto a los recursos gen\u00e9ticos, se respalda la funci\u00f3n central de la FAO para ayudar en todas las formas posibles a detener la erosi\u00f3n y la p\u00e9rdida de valiosos recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos. Esto consideramos que es una cuesti\u00f3n fundamental para la agricultura, ya no especifica de un solo pa\u00eds, creo que estos representan uno de los principales patrimonios de la humanidad que hay que cuidar. El otro d\u00eda expres\u00e9 que ten\u00eda m\u00e1s temor que a la guerra nuclear a los problemas ecol\u00f3gico que nos van a hacer inhabitable el mundo sin que se tire una sola bomba. Creemos tambi\u00e9n que debemos destacar el subprograma 2. 1. 2. 3 \"Semillas\", y su interrelaci\u00f3n con las actividades en relaci\u00f3n con la Comisi\u00f3n y el compromiso internacional sobre recursos fitogen\u00e9ticos, p\u00e1rrafo 41, y apoyamos espec\u00edficamente tambi\u00e9n, porque creemos que su control es importante tambi\u00e9n en funci\u00f3n de mantener la verdadera sanidad dentro de la producci\u00f3n, el p\u00e1rrafo 63, que es la aplicaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo internacional de plaguicidas. Creo que es muy interesante su difusi\u00f3n porque uno de los problemas graves que hay en nuestro medio subdesarrollado es la incapacidad para conocer el alcance que puedan tener a favor o en contra la aplicaci\u00f3n de los plaguicidas mientras nuestros pa\u00edses no tengan legislaciones internas para su control y mientras seamos pasto de comerciantes que les interesa vender sin que sepamos lo que nos venden o algunos pa\u00edses donde un producto est\u00e1 prohibido y sin embargo, est\u00e1 permitido venderlo. Estas cuestiones consideramos que son muy importantes, Sr. Presidente. En ganader\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n creo que se discuti\u00f3 con profundidad. Los p\u00e1rrafos nos dicen la gama enorme de puntos que se discutieron. Sin embargo, nosotros queremos hacer hincapi\u00e9 en la sanidad animal, salvar al que tenemos vivo, y al ganado al que tenemos ya en la mano, mejorar los servicios veterinarios y combatir las principales enfermedades infecciosas. Creo que son puntos estrat\u00e9gicos para poder hablar de una ganader\u00eda de futuro. Igualmente, Sr. Presidente, es muy importante la rama de la investigaci\u00f3n. Nos complaci\u00f3 leer todos los p\u00e1rrafos referentes a la discusi\u00f3n de este punto. Por lo tanto, deseamos destacar el p\u00e1rrafo 106, sobre todo en su ultimo p\u00e1rrafo referente a que era oportuno que los centros de investigaci\u00f3n de los pa\u00edses desarrollados dedicaran parte de sus recursos y su atenci\u00f3n a cuestiones, problemas de importancia para las regiones en desarrollo. Nosotros consideramos que es una buena se\u00f1alizaci\u00f3n por parte del Comit\u00e9 de Programas. Sobre el desarrollo rural nosotros no nos cansaremos nunca de destacar la necesidad de un subprograma muy importante que surge con fuerza en los momentos de crisis alimentaria, porque, por desgracia, uno de los animales de menos memoria del mundo es el hombre; por lo tanto se le olvidan las consecuencias de los problemas tan pronto pasan. Es el subprograma \"Reforma Agraria\", p\u00e1rrafos 119 y 126. Creemos que es n ecesario que se atienda el Programa de Acci\u00f3n de la Conferencia Mundial de Reforma Agraria y Desarrollo Rural para lograr toda una serie de cuestiones que hemos o\u00eddo referir y escuchado de muchos colegas sobre el acceso de la tierra, el acceso al agua, a la justicia social, la equidad, los precios, los cr\u00e9ditos; todo eso debe ser un paquete, un contexto que nosotros consideramos que se llama reforma agraria. A veces hay un poco de temor, adem\u00e1s de falta de memoria, el hombre padece de otra enfermedad que se llama miedo, que le tiene miedo a la palabra. La palabra reforma agraria se ha diversificado mucho, se han hecho muchas malas, porque se han hecho muchas buenas en el papel y a la hora de aplicarla nos hemos rajado entre los agr\u00f3nomos, los intelectuales, los pol\u00edticos y los productores de maquinarla, que lo que quieren es vender maquinaria y no ha habido realmente una aplicaci\u00f3n correcta de la reforma agraria. Pero una aplicaci\u00f3n desajustada no quiere decir que es mala. Hay pa\u00edses a los cuales se les interrumpi\u00f3 violentamente en los procesos de reforma. Todas esas son cuestiones que algunas minor\u00edas no permiten que lleguen y, por tanto, las hemos olvidado un poco. Es un punto que nosotros quer\u00edamos hacer. -456- Para concluir, Sr. Presidente, reiteramos el apoyo de nuestra delegaci\u00f3n al trabajo del Comit\u00e9 y a los informes presentados considerando que el prisma bajo el cual ha trabajado y que debe seguir valor\u00e1ndose en funci\u00f3n de ver en qu\u00e9 medida se pueden perfeccionar, se pueden mejorar, se expresa claramente en los p\u00e1rrafos 163 y 165, que nos parecen un gran colof\u00f3n de estos grandes informes sobre todo del documento CL 90/3\u00b7 El p\u00e1rrafo 103 es para nosotros una explicaci\u00f3n muy amplia de cu\u00e1l, realmente en lo que convino el Comit\u00e9 de lo que es el Programa de Labores y Presupuesto, y los ex\u00e1menes del Programa ordinario, y el 165, el reconocimiento del Comit\u00e9, que, bas\u00e1ndose en su propia experiencia, en la capacidad de comprender, evaluar y valorar la labor de la FAO debe hacer frente. Creo que es muy necesario saber, valorar lo que hace la FAO teniendo en cuenta sus problemas, y, por la otra, las medidas adoptadas por la Organizaci\u00f3n. Son dos cuestiones que consideramos tambi\u00e9n de car\u00e1cter no t\u00e1ctico sino estrat\u00e9gico, porque a veces no nos damos cuenta a la hora de valorar qu\u00e9 velocidad debemos tener sobre una carretera si no sabemos las curvas o los obst\u00e1culos que tiene esa carretera. Creo que el Comit\u00e9 inst\u00f3 a que se prosiguiera la pol\u00edtica de a ccesib ilidad y disponibilidad para dar a los programas de la FAO sus efectos, la mayor difusi\u00f3n posible. Creo que \u00e9stas son cuestiones muy importantes en estos momentos y nosotros tenemos una gran preocupaci\u00f3n con el programa de la difusi\u00f3n. Hemos aceptado y estamos de acuerdo que como alternativa de los problemas financieros una de las cuestiones que m\u00e1s debemos, y se ha planteado aqu\u00ed, eliminar o tratar de no hacer para no gastar, serian las publicaciones. Es verdad que nadie viene pidiendo libros, todo el mundo viene pidiendo proyectos, pero creemos que, si decimos que la capacitaci\u00f3n es fundamental, tenemos tambi\u00e9n que ayudar a capacitar no s\u00f3lo a nosotros los funcionarlos sino que esta capacitaci\u00f3n de la FAO llegue a las diversas regiones, a las asociaciones campesinas de las cooperativas, de las granjas, de pueblos que se deben beneficiar del trabajo de la FAO. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): I would like first of all to thank the Chairman of the Programme Committee, Mr. Mazoyer, for his excellent introduction regarding the two latest sessions of the Programme Committee. I must express my particular satisfaction that 1 am the first delegate of Yugoslavia who, after quite a long time, can speak freely and express recognition and full satisfaction with the work and the results of the Programme Committee, and particularly of its Chairman. Those of you who have been participating for a long time in FAO activities would guess the Programme Committee during the last few years. For those who cannot guess, I have to reveal the secret. The fact is that one of my compatriots, whom most of you know well, was the first Member and then the Chairman of the Programme Committee for a decade. On the other side, the natural modesty of ray countrymen has deprived us of the satisfaction of dignifying and praising the work of the Programme Committee in such circumstances. I hope that my statement can be taken by the distinguished audience in its relative and, at least, half humouristic sense crude humour and not the sophisticated British type of humour. Coming back to the serious track on which discussions of this subject have gone, I would like on behalf of the Yugoslav delegation to highly commend the work of the Programme Committee at its last two sessions. We fully support their conclusions and recommendations. We particularly appreciate their highly technical and excellently-oriented analysis and conclusions in some major fields of the work of FAO, namely natural resources, crops, livestock, research and technology, rural development and FAO training activities. I should like also to join the concern of the Programme on decreasing share of FAO in operational UNDP and resources, and the ever increasing implementation through the so-called OPE (Office of the Execution of the UNDP). My delegation shares the assessment of the Programme Committee that by FAO Specialized deprived of expertise experience of these Specialized Agencies, and these may lead to some kind of wasteful overlaps. Finally, I cannot help but express my c legation's surprise, and disagreement, at the request by some representatives that our Organization instead of concentrating its full power and resources on implementation of the agreed programmes and priorities, should turn the focus of its attention to the Organization and its inter-governmental bodies in a kind of general self-examination review, and maybe a revision, of the FAO role and programmes. My delegation does not find it necessary and useful at this crucial moment to waste the time and precious resources on the studies and discussions in inter-gouvernmental bodies which, in our opinion would not contribute to the achievement of the objectives set up by the Constitution of FAO, the World Food Conference, WCARRD, the so-called 1976 Consensus, the last FAO General Conference, and so on. The right time and place to raise this issue, for those who consider it useful, may be only the next Gene ral Conference in 1987. At that time the Programme and the Finance Committees and the Council should concentrate their activities on the execution of the programmes agreed by the last Conference. -457- Amin ABDEL-MALEK (Lebanon): I am sorry to ask for the floor for the second time at such a late hour, but I found it necessary to intervene on that same point. The Lebanese delegation docs not see any reason to ask the Director-General to make a report as proposed on the long-term function of the FAO, since we have every reason to believe that the major policy consensus reache d in 1976, and confirmed unanimously in the 1977 Conferen ce, is still fully valid and should not be reconsidered, especially in the light of the financial difficulties that prevail, in the meantime in FAO. Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of) (Original language Arabic): First of all my delegation would like to congratulate and thank most warmly the Chairman of the Programme Committee and the other Members for their good work, which shows the seriousness and the interest they have shown in their report the provision of technical aid and consultation services. This was something that the Joint Inspection Unit stressed. We should like to give our support to the content of both reports from the Programme Committee. I should to be brief and to certain important paragraphs, in document CL 90/16. I should like to refer to paragraphs 103 and 104 of that document. These say that an increasing number of Trust Fund projects which had a training component have been requested by various governments. This is something to which we give our full support. We are also very pleased with what is contained in paragraph 101, particularly with what it contains about group training, and institution building. We are pleased that there has been continuous and fruitful particularly DANIDA. Here I should like to come back to the what was said by other delegations, particularly what was said by Denmark about a review of FAO's function, the role of Programme by committees. What concerns us is the enthusiasm and zeal with which these ideas have been put forward and taken up. This gave us the impression that the FAO and the Committees set up by the Council-and I do not know whether Committees set up by the general Conference are included in this idea-are rusted and can have new life breathed into them. I do not really see the reason for all of this. Governments have to seriously reconsider their positions. For our part, we would like to support the opposite point of view, particularly in the situation in which FAO now finds itself. We have to be very careful, particularly the difficulties the appeal expressed by a number of delegations that we do not carry out this review. We have to make sure that the FAO can work properly to the benefit of all countries, particularly to the benefit of developing countries. Another proposal was made that the Finance Committee and the Programme Committee be merged. We are somewhat surprised, not at the proposal itself but because those who proposed this are fully acquainted with the role and responsibility of both these individual committees. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Si fuera mal pensado creer\u00eda que durante este 90\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Consejo ha habido una convergencia sospechosa de hechos que negativizan a la FAO y a su Director General, pero como no soy mal pensado dir\u00e9 solamente que han sido coincidencias. Desde el primer d\u00eda de labores de este Consejo algunos pa\u00edses industrializados plantearon la alternabilidad en el cargo de Director General de la FAO como si la Conferencia no tuviera la facultad de decidir quien debe ocupar esa Direcci\u00f3n General. Posteriormente, algunas delegaciones tambi\u00e9n de pa\u00edses industrializados comenzaron a cuestionar la transparencia de la FAO en la rendici\u00f3n de las cuentas al Consejo, desconociendo el trabajo positivo y satisfactorio del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y sus miembros. El mismo Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas reconoci\u00f3 y agradeci\u00f3 la transparencia de la Secretar\u00eda de la FAO y del Director General por presentar claramente al Comit\u00e9 toda la documentaci\u00f3n administrativa y financiera solicitada por los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas para realizar sus trabajos de acuerdo con su mandato. No necesito insistir aqu\u00ed en recordar que los miembros del Co mit\u00e9 de Finanzas as\u00ed como los miembros del Comit\u00e9 del Programa son elegidos por el Consejo y que gozan de toda nuestra confianza. Inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de esa critica sobre la transparencia de la FAO en los asuntos financieros y despu\u00e9s de que se mencion\u00f3 la alternabilidad en el cargo de Director General circul\u00f3 una Nota Verbal que conten\u00eda la solicitud de apoyo de otro candidato para el cargo de Director General en las elecciones que se llevar\u00e1n a cabo en la Conferencia de noviembre de 1987. Que se entienda bien, se\u00f1or Presidente, que esto no lo decimos en sentido peyorativo. -458- Por ultimo, tenemos como un tema de nuestra agenda de trabajo una propuesta de revision del metodo de el ecci\u00f3n de los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y del Programa, porque durante el 89\u00b0 periodo de sesiones del Consejo una regi\u00f3n desarrollada, compuesta de s\u00f3lo dos pa\u00edses, no fue elegida para integrar el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas a pesar de haber presentado un candidato. Esperamos que las coincidencias que menciono no sean utilizadas ahora para cuestionar el Comit\u00e9 del Programa y a todo el mecanismo de decisi\u00f3n establecido en los textos fundamentales de la Organizaci\u00f3n. El Comit\u00e9 del Programa cumple con su mandato de acuerdo a los textos fundamentales y a los asuntos que le somete la Conferencia. En la situaci\u00f3n financiera actual de la FAO, tal como fue debatida en d\u00edas pasados, el Comit\u00e9 del Programa debe mantener los objectivos prioritarios de trabajo establecidos por la Conferencia de noviembre de 1985, es decir sin modificaci\u00f3n, como lo han sugerido muchas delegaciones. Para finalizar, apoyamos el contenido de los dos informes del Comit\u00e9 del Programa que se han sometido para aprobaci\u00f3n. Philippe PIOTET (France): ainsi celles donn\u00e9es par Membres du si la r\u00e9union Comit\u00e9 du programme\u00b7 En effet, ce examinons actuellement. Ce a un mandat, comme d'autres comit\u00e9s, les domaines de l'agriculture, des p\u00eaches ou des produits, et rempli sa t\u00e2che mani\u00e8re satisfaisante. Pour ma part, la et nous appuyons les rapports qui sont s'il fallait regrouper ou non un certain nombre de comit\u00e9s, notamment le Comit\u00e9 du Programme et le Comit\u00e9 financier. Je pense, l\u00e0 pour nous prononcer aujourd'hui sur pas aujourd'hui les aussi, les \u00e9voquer sur notre Je pense qu'il et de les propositions qui nous sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 ce mandat. Pour ma part, nous estimons que ce comit\u00e9 est engag\u00e9 dans la bonne direction. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): I would like to thank Mr. Mazoyer for his presentation and to say that we were not considering taking the floor during the discussion of this my delegation agreement with both reports of the Programme Committee and we did not deem it n ecessary to take up all the subjects and review them one by one. However, as this very important subject was raised and the discussion continued on the refer the subject by the Danish Delegation, and supported by other delegations) that is why we deem it n ecessary to repeat what we have said under item 12. 1 of the Agenda. About three days ago, when we were discussing financial questions such -459- issues were raised in a different manner and on this question we had to make some remarks I will not repeat them in full but I just want to say that my delegation is ready to contribute to the process of increasing the efficiency of the Organization. At the same time, we think that this an ongoing process, with the full cooperation of the Member Countries and the Secretariat. This ongoing process can be more fruitfully served by debating these on the appropriate occasions the appropriate fora and by observing the procedures established by our Organization. We just wanted to make this statement which is only repetition of what we have already said. Javed MUSHARRAF (Pakistan): I would just like to say that we were not thinking of taking the floor but for a different reason to Turkey, mainly because I am a member of the Programme Committee, I hope one of the much questioned, and not questionable, members of the Programme Committee. I think that our task is merely to stand by the report which we have prepared and there is the need to listen. I am not only a member but a new member and as the chairman has said in the introduction, it takes a number of years to get to know the work and to appreciate it. I am just an apprentice, rather an \"enfant\" and 1 hope not an \"enfant Canada has described itself. The has made a very thoughful, very provocative and very original statement, as always. We thought that we should also express some thoughts on the matter as an reaction, although not a very considerate and detailed reaction. 1 would like to thank our Chairman, Mr. Mazoyer for his very authentic and special description of the work of the Programme Committee which he gave with such passion the the Programme Committee. 1 would also join with our Chairman in expressing the sentiments of the FAO staff, especially the Programme and Budget wing who have always provide d our Committee with all the information. The divisions concerned, when examining their programmes, will come up with presentations and detailed papers. Even colour transparencies are produced in our meetings, in fact, we have not just transparency but transparencies (plural) in fact, a plethora of transparency. As far as we in the Programme Committee are concerned, we try our best, within our limitations, and with our respective blasses, to do our job. I come now to the main points of the issues raised by the delegate of Denmark. Firstly, 1 to seek clarification that the priorities he mentioned are not the same priorities mentioned by the delegate of the United States of America. It is true that in paragraph 9, priority is given to training ECDC, transfer of technology, etc. However, 1 suspect that what the delegate of Denmark was referring to were not these priorities, but programmes. Whilst training, ECDC, etc. are components programme priorities, namely fisheries versus forestry, versus nutrition, versus things to that. That should be made clear. In saying that, paragraph 9 is also laying think the of the Representatives of Denmark referred to, one could say that this is already being done by the Programme Committee. It is being done on an ongoing basis at the proper time, but once the programme is set by the Conference, the Programme Committee cannot change its priorities. However, Programme Committee goes into priorities, and even at improper times, which has happened on the last two occasions which I have attended. At that time priorities were generally discussed or raised. I remember, for example, one member, who is on this floor right now, mentioned the priority of meat and dairy Therefore, the emphasis or de-emphasis on particular sectors or particular programmes defined by the Representative of Denmark is being considered at the proper time, and even at improper times. Also what to cut down and not just what to increase is sometimes discussed, as pointed out by the delegate of India. There was a long discussion on what to cut down, not to cut down on glossy publications, etc. In the process of the Programme Committee, priorities are discussed and things which are to be cut down are also discussed. Of course, this kind of process has to strengthened, extended and encouraged to become an ongoing process. The point raised by the delegate of Austria would be that the Basic Texts certainly do not exclude the Programme body, programme but of course, at the proper time. The question is, is this now the proper time for doing it? If I am correct, this Council, at this Session, is merely reviewing the work of the Programme Committee, which in itself is only reviewing the programme which has already been approved by It certainly seems that neither the Programme Committee, in the last two sessions, nor this Session of the Council, should be examining the programme priorities which are already examining priorities in the long run, especially at critical times like this, I would agree with the delegate of Congo when he said that perhaps the timing is all right, and with the delegate of India when he said that it should not be done in mid-course. Therefore, perhaps this meeting today should not be doing it. I now refer to the two programmes which were specifically mentioned by the delegate of Denmark, namely when he spoke of nutrition and human resources. This is not the correct time, but this is a quick response, even though it is the improper time to that. Should the FAO be the lead agency for nutrition? I think the following may be some of the relevant aspects. First of all, let us look at the history. If one can recall, the first Director-General of the FAO was a nutritionist. When the FAO was set up, nutrition was meant to be a very central part of the function and its role. Perhaps it might have deviated from that la id-down path in the course of years. The question is, should it deviate further should to original intention, following the historical path as we see? Food and nutr ition is a concept so is health and nutrition. Just as food is linked with nutrition, health is also linked to nutrition. Therefore, both the World Health Organization and FAO seem to have a role to play in nutrition. As far as the FAO is concerned, the whole reference point of food and agriculture should be nutrition. If one removes that reference point, one can have a situation where you have agriculture without food, and food without nutrition. Removing the central reference point in its original mandate of nutrition would have the dangerous consequence of creating more food without nutrition. Perhaps there is a need to strengthen the nutritional side-the linkage of the Nutrition division with the other divisions of FAO incorporating nutrition as much as possible into all projects of food and agriculture, etc? Should the World Health Organization Be doing this? My personal observation is that the World Health Organization consists mainly of doctors. Doctors are known One in Are correct people, or are agriculturist s the correct people to be entrusted with the very important task of nutrition? It is a question which we have to carefully examine. Another question which must be asked is what competence has the FAO built up and what competence has the World Health Organization built up in this field of nutrition compared to all the other bodies? I do not think a judgement is possible at this stage without all the facts being known to us. Another fact is that the World Health Organization devotes only 2 percent of its budget to nutrition. perhaps or not really concerned much about the present compared to the FAO? I would agree with the delegate of France when he said we do not have the facts, and that this is not the proper time to go into it. However, the Programme Committee, the Council and the Conference, in principle, should be doing this. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I ask for thirty seconds because I do not want it thought, after so many speakers and so many lectures this evening, that the absence of a word from the Host Country should be misinterpreted as being indifference or showing lack of interest. Let me only felicitate and congratulate the hard work done by this Committee, especially, the presentation and the leadership by the Chairman, Mr. Mazoyer, and to say that we do not feel strangers to this Committee. By reading these excellent documents we feel a part of this Committee. We fully justify the existence of the Committee and appreciate the discussions and the depth of the discussions which under his leadership took place. We wish to congratulate all members of the Committee for their work. Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Gracias por referirse al tema de los informes de los periodos de sesiones 50 y 51 del Comit\u00e9 de Programas. Sr. Presidente, en el p\u00e1rrafo 105 del documento CL 90/3 se mencionan las actividades del programa que se traducen en la contribuci\u00f3n en cooperaci\u00f3n con los Estados Miembros para identificar, formular, ejecutar programas orientados a mitigar la pobreza rural. Dentro de este contexto, Sr. Presidente, mi delegaci\u00f3n se complace en poner \u00e9nfasis en la ejecuci\u00f3n de programas que tiendan a hacer efectiva la idea del Sr. Presidente de Colombia, Excelent\u00edsimo Sr. Virgilio Barco, en contra de la pobreza absoluta. En Chile hemos enfrentado desde hace algunos a\u00f1os el problema con la denominaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9rica de erradicaci\u00f3n de los sectores de extrema pobreza, que es preocupaci\u00f3n prioritaria de mi Gobierno, incluyendo diversos programas nutricionales y de emergencia con el efectivo incremento del gasto social dentro del presupuesto en los t\u00e9rminos abrumadores que este Consejo conoce y con la erradicaci\u00f3n de las debidas miserias que se encuentran en disminuci\u00f3n igual que la emigraci\u00f3n desde el campo a la ciudad. -461- Sr. Presidente, ral delegaci\u00f3n alienta el concepto del CPTD y las conclusiones del Plan de Acci\u00f3n de Buenos Aires sobre cooperaci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica entre pa\u00edses en desarrollo, mencionado en los p\u00e1rrafos 140 y siguientes del mismo documento CL 90/3 y exhorta a atender tales conclusiones asoci\u00e1ndose a lo dicho por los colegas latinoamericanos. Sr. Presidente, refiri\u00e9ndome a los p\u00e1rrafos 30 y 31 del documento CL 90/16, perm\u00edtame felicitar al Comit\u00e9 de Programas por sus conclusiones en lo que se refiere a los servicios de bibliotecas y de informaci\u00f3n y, por lo tanto, concordamos con lo expresado al respecto por Austria. Mi delegaci\u00f3n apoya lo indicado por la de Dinamarca en lo relativo a la importancia del papel de la FAO en el campo de la nutrici\u00f3n en coordinaci\u00f3n estrecha con otros organismos del sistema de Naciones unidas tales como MS, aspecto en el cual mi delegaci\u00f3n se permite agregar a la UNICEF por la invalorable labor de esta organizaci\u00f3n en el apoyo de la infancia sin que para lo anterior sea necesario cambiar los textos b\u00e1sicos de la FAO y considerando la necesidad de no incurrir en mayores gastos. Con respecto a los textos b\u00e1sicos, me permito recomendar la lectura del pre\u00e1mbulo y del Art\u00edculo de la Constituci\u00f3n de la FAO, en los cuales encontramos cinco veces la palabra nutrici\u00f3n. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie le Chili Conseil ensemble celles concernant notre mode de fonctionnement. Je ne veux intervenir dans votre d\u00e9bat, ni me substituer \u00e0 vous pour ce qui est de vos opinions sur les programmes et la mani\u00e8re programmes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9s il y a un an par le Comit\u00e9, le Conseil et la Conf\u00e9rence, devrions nous en apercevoir et que nous le dirions. Ce nous faisons, contre-et beaucoup posent dans le monde, d'examiner ce que la FAO a mis en place avec votre accord. Je vous confirme-m\u00eame nous le disons, si vous lisez bien le document il d\u00e9croche assez de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re ou il y a deux ans. Lisez bien le document; il y a sur la recherche, le d\u00e9veloppement, l'information, les publications, les technologies appropri\u00e9es, des pas et un la et n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l'ordre du jour. Cela dire que nous serions comp\u00e9tente \u00e0 de dit, je voudrais lever une nos analyses la situation mondiale, si nous pas notre la crise et n'exposons les raisons pour lesquelles nous pensons que les trois quarts de la paysannerie du tiers monde sont en difficult\u00e9, ou en voie de disparition, cela ne veut pas dire que nous ne pensons rien \u00e0 ce y une crise agricole et alimentaire, elle est \u00e9galement que nous budget, et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait il y a un an, nous le faisons avec le m\u00eame document que le Comit\u00e9 des finances; et nous savons dans quel cadre programmes, ni m\u00eame aucun accroissement de 50 ou 30 pour cent des programmes, et ce qui ne suppose pas non plus une r\u00e9duction de moiti\u00e9. Peut-\u00eatre sera-ce pour pas \u00e0 anticiper sur bien entendu nous travaillerons dans le cadre de 50 pour cent. Ce n'est pas nous qui fixons le budget \u00e0 nous en tr\u00e8s conscients. Il tas de choses que nous aimerions proposer, mais que nous ne pouvons limite de nos r\u00e9flexions. sont je faire comprendre le cadre dans lequel nous travaillons, ce que nous faisons, ce que nous pouvons faire, de m\u00eame que ce que nous ne pouvons pas faire. Peut-\u00eatre faisons-nous plus que ce qui est \u00e9crit dans notre rapport. Cela aussi il fallait le dire. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: I think for this side of the podium it is only necessary to deal at this late hour with two specific areas which have emerged in the course of the debate. I would like to speak first of the proposal put forward on behalf of the Nordic countries by the representative Denmark and supported by a number of other representatives in the course of the discussion. The time may be coming when the membership of FAO at large will want a complete review made of the Organization's priorities, roles, procedures and programmes. Such a review can be made in two ways. It can be made in a way that is divisive and leads to acrimony, or it can be carried out in a way that is harmonious and leads to consensus. I am sure that the Nordic countries and others who spoke in favour of the proposal would wish the objective to be a series of harmonious and consensus decisions at the end of the line. Now I would like to make two observations. First of all, what the delegations who spoke on this matter have in mind is clearly a quite radical review of FAO and how it works, not a simple shuffling of priorities. I can just refer to the three examples that come to mind that were given as the sort of things that such a review might deal with. One was the idea of setting up a joint division on nutrition with WHO; another was a joint division on human resources with ILO and the -463- third was the possible merger of the Programme and Finance Committees. Now I it is entirely unrealistic to expect the Director-General simply to come forward in a paper with radical proposals of this nature. Such decisions, if they were to be taken, must surely emerge gradually as the desires of Member Nations crystalize, as they have time to think about these issues and as they come to translate their views into specific proposals. If this is to be handled in a harmonious way I would make the following suggestions. 1987 is the year of the new Programme of Work and Budget. Linked to the Programme of by the Director-General in the document containing the Programme of Work and Budget. It is not only that these objectives will be considered in the Programme of Work and Budget through the Programme and Finance Committees and Council, the question of Medium-Term objectives will also be on the most single Committee on Agriculture, the Programme Committee, the Finance Committee and the Council will enable Member Nations to express their views and proposals on this extremely important matter. All these views and suggestions, on the Director-General's views relating to medium term objectives, views and suggestions put forward by Member Nations, will converge in the Conference. Surely then the Conference can decide whether it wishes to launch such a full-scale review. It can set the broad terms of reference and content of such a review and it can establish the procedures for carrying it out. As was recalled by several speakers, this is by no means the first time this has been done in FAO and invariably so far the mechanism has been a Committee established by the Conference. There is no inevitable reason why things should be the same again this time just because they were that way in the past . However, as a general handled exactly the harmonious manner, hopefully leading to a consensus at the end of the line, which I have advocated as the most desirable end. The second point I would like to mention relates to the section in of the Committee dealing with operational activities. It was para 160. These paragraphs, I may recall, went forward to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and were considered in an overall debate on the operational activities of the UN system. Insofar as these paragraphs have come in for criticism in the course of the debate, I see it as being criticism for the sin of not being bland, of not pretending that everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. This section does not hide the fact that there have been and are tensions in the partnership between UNDP and FAO, and incidentally with other This fact was brought home to delegates attending the Economic and Social Council, in many cases, I believe, the same delegations who attend the UNDP Governing Council, and it did at least bring home to them the fact that there is another side of the story, that there is an FAO view on the tensions to which I referred. I believe that this whole exercise may well prove to have been useful in bringing these matters into the open and in leading towards their reduction and ultimately, we hope, in their elimination. I do not wish to pursue the controversy on this matter, but just in case anybody has the feeling that the story is as simple as was described by the representative of UNDP earlier-and I am sorry he is not here to hear me-I would just recall that there is a gendarme in the UN system, and this gendarme is the Joint Inspection Unit. About three years ago, the Joint Inspection Unit put forward a report that was critical of the UNDP's office for project execution. As far as I know, no action has been taken on the Report of the Joint Inspection Unit. I mention this merely to bring home to the Council that matters are not quite as simple as they might have thought. I would like to recall that in 1987 there will be a new report on operational activities going forward to the Economic and Social Council. We discussed this under another Agenda item and the Council has already noted the arrangements that will be made for FAO to comment on a short list of specific operational questions put to all the agencies of the system by the Economic and Social Council. So there will be this further report on operational activities in 1987 and the content of the FAO response will be going via the Programme Committee to the Council.

First Report on Unscheduled and Cancelled Sessions in the 1986-87 Biennium 13. l'exercice 1986-87 13. Primer informe sobre las reuniones no previstas y anuladas en el bienio 1986-87 V. J. SHAH (Director, Office of Prog ramme, Budget and Evaluation): This document is submitted to the Council for information, in accordance with the practice which began a long time ago in 1968. The Council since then requested the Director-General to submit such a document once a year indicating the changes which have occurred in the meetings scheduled. It was approved as part of the Programme of Work and Budget for the biennium. We have tried, over the years, to make this document as clear and as self-explanatory as possible. You will see that during 1986 to date, 34 unscheduled sessions were approved for reasons which are explained for each meeting. Thirty sessions have been cancelled, again with reasons explaining why they were cancelled. In view of the lateness of the hour, perhaps you would prefer make any comments. However, of course, I am at your Member would to pris des explications M. Shah et nous le remercions. 14.

Prenant la page 2 de ce document, je voudrais indiquer exactement o\u00f9 il y a changements dans travaux le du changements. Au mois de d\u00e9cembre 1986, nous avons, le 15 et le 16, la session extraordinaire du Comit\u00e9 financier dont le recouvrait en partie les dates Just a question on a technical matter which perhaps may be in bad taste when we are in open Council. However, I think under the Basic Texts of the Organization, dates are fixed by the Secretariat in consultation with the respective Chairmen. If that is correct, at least in one meeting I notice here the Chairmen were not consulted either in fixing the date for it nor the change in it. If that is the case, perhaps the Secretariat can clarify whether or not the procedure has been followed? I am referring to the Committee on Commodity Problems of which I happen to be the Chairman. LE SECRETAIRE GENERAL: produits et du d\u00e9partement \u00e9conomique et social qui ont la responsabilit\u00e9 premi\u00e8re d'organiser les sessions du Comit\u00e9.

Rapport int\u00e9rimaire sur les activit\u00e9s de la Journ\u00e9e mondiale de l'alimentation : 9. Informe sobre las actividades del Dia Mundial de la Alimentaci\u00f3n : R. MORENO ROJAS (Direcci\u00f3n de Recursos Humanos, Ins tituciones y Reforma Agraria): En aras del tiempo reducir\u00e9 aun m\u00e1s la declaraci\u00f3n que la Secretar\u00eda desea hacer sobre este tema. Creo que es materia bastante conocida por los miembros y observadores de este Consejo. -466- Quisiera agregar algo al documento que ha sido circulado, dos tipos de informaciones. La primera destaca que el D\u00eda Mundial de la Alimentaci\u00f3n de 1986, cuyo tema fue\"los pescadores o sus comunidades, \" tuvo una gran acogida en los distintos pa\u00edses del mundo dado lo innovativo del tema mismo y el atractivo que tenia para los pa\u00edses en la forma en que \u00e9sto podr\u00eda ser organizado. Para solemnizar la ceremonia que se realiz\u00f3 aqu\u00ed en la sede central de la FAO en Roma, el Director General invit\u00f3 a la se\u00f1ora Presidente de lslandia, se\u00f1ora Vigdis Finnbogadottir, al se\u00f1or Ministro de Agricultura de Italia, se\u00f1or Filippo Maria Pandolfi y al Secretarlo General de la Liga de Estados Arabes, se\u00f1or Chedli Klibi. Ellos, junto con el Director General, se dirigieron a la Asamblea que se convoc\u00f3 en forma plenaria en ese d\u00eda y se\u00f1alaron junto con distintos mensajes que fueron recibidos, la prioridad y la importancia de este tema. He de destacar, tambi\u00e9n, que en dicha ocasi\u00f3n fue le\u00eddo un mensaje especial enviado por Su Santidad el Papa Juan Pablo II. El segundo punto que yo quisiera se\u00f1alar, es en relaci\u00f3n con el tema escogido por el Director General para conmemorar el D\u00eda Mundial de la Alime ntaci\u00f3n del a\u00f1o 1987. Es en esta ocasi\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Presidente, que tenemos la posibilidad de anunciar oficialmente el tema escogido con el objeto de facilitar la preparaci\u00f3n a nivel nacional de este tipo de eventos. El tema seleccionado y que esta muy en l\u00ednea con lo que ha sido el debate recientemente celebrado, es \"El peque\u00f1o Agricultor\"\u00b7 Este es un tema que pr\u00e1cticamente en su profundidad tiene una significaci\u00f3n en todos los pa\u00edses, la mayor\u00eda de las delegaciones se han referido insistentemente a la necesidad no s\u00f3lo de vincular las acciones nacionales, sino que los distintos programas internacionales a \u00e9l, y obviamente la flexib ilidad que ha venido siendo adquirida en la observaci\u00f3n nacion al con la vinculaci\u00f3n de los Comit\u00e9s nacionales, los organismos no gubernamentales y otras entidades de tipo cultural que existen dentro de los pa\u00edses, estamos ciertos que el tema del peque\u00f1o agricultor, o los peque\u00f1os agricultores es un tema que realmente podr\u00e1 ser celebrado en forma adecuada. Las vinculaciones de este aspecto con la seguridad alimentaria, con la misma discusi\u00f3n que se celebrar\u00e1 en Roma en el a\u00f1o 1987, en la Conferencia General, cuando sea presentado el informe sobre los avances logrados en materia de desarrollo rural y reforma agraria, para los cuales los propios pa\u00edses hoy d\u00eda est\u00e1n preparando sus temas, tienen una vinculaci\u00f3n que obviamente, escapa a lo que en estos momentos yo mismo podr\u00eda detallar. Creo, se\u00f1or Presidente, que puedo detenerme en este momento. La declaraci\u00f3n de la Secretar\u00eda era m\u00e1s extensa, se la haremos llegar a nuestro colega, el Secretarlo del Consejo, en el caso de que la desee insertar y quiero decirle que en la Secretaria hemos recibido, o estamos recibiendo, los informes de los pa\u00edses respecto de lo que fue la celebraci\u00f3n del A\u00f1o 1986. Por lo tanto, para ganar tiempo, sugiero que, salvo que alguna delegaci\u00f3n en forma muy particular lo desee hacer ac\u00e1, podr\u00edan ser entregados igualmente los textos para completar la informaci\u00f3n si lo desean, al Secretario del Consejo, y ello vendr\u00e1 insertado dentro del texto de esta reuni\u00f3n. Hermann REDL (Austria): Owing to the late time and your recommendation I shall try to be very brief. As regards the preparation of information material for World Food Day, it may be remarked that we should try in the future to prepare up-to-date information on the world food situation, agricultural and forestry production and so on, in order to meet the requirements of the mass media. The monthly FAO publications coming out in the autumn, for example, The State of Food Production Year Book could be prepared in the form of an abstract for the media. This could be done, for instance, by means of updated Information sheets. Costs could be kept considerably low. Due to the present world food situation, it seems to be of utmost importance to draw the attention of the public to the world food programmes, and in particular, to the solutions initiated by FAO. Donat CHINKUMO (Cameroun): en 1986. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I will do the same, with your permission, 1 will hand in a statement. -467- LE PRESIDENT: Je pense que tout le monde conscient de notre contrainte de temps.

Our observances of World Food Day met with a great response in the news media and among the public. Because of our Federal constitution we entrust every year another Federal state with the organization of World Food Day. In 1985 the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was the organizer, in 1986 the state of Schleswig-Holstein. The public interest in this year's World Food Day-as will soon send our national report on World Food Day activities to the Director-General 2 / always appreciates efforts of FAO in respect to drawing the attention of public opinion to the dimensions of food deficit in the world, as well as the necessity of achieving food security, through the selection of 16 October of each year to celebrate World Food Day, which we all consider the front which reflects the efforts, programmes, policies and strategies of FAO towards the development of agricultural production. We also appreciate very much the selection of various subjects in celebrating this Day. We are convinced of vital role played by gap and providing food. Egypt celebrated this year with that Day. The celebration was attended by His Excellency the Deputy Prime Minister for Agriculture and all the high ranking officers in the Agricultural Sector. His Excellency made a speech indicating the national efforts towards the development of the fisheries sector in Egypt and the role of FAO in assisting this sector. Some fishermen were selected to receive certificates of achievement. In add to a was undertaken among the pupils of preparatory and secondary schools in the Arabic language for the best article on the role of fisheries, in order to increase their knowledge with regard to the important role of fisheries, and its impact on the nutritional level in Egypt. The first ten pupils were granted certificates of achievement and prizes. 2 / The meeting rose at 20. 15. La s\u00e9ance est lev\u00e9e \u00e0 20 h 15.

ALVARENGA (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos): Para evitar un posible malentendido ruego al Consejo que me permita aclarar que he venido expresamente del pa\u00eds a esta reuni\u00f3n, de mi pa\u00eds, donde me encontraba, y desde el lunes anticip\u00e9 que este d\u00eda me era imposible porque ten\u00eda un compromiso extremadamente serio y no pod\u00eda estar presente en la ma\u00f1ana; ayer qued\u00e9 en que empezar\u00eda el punto a las once y hoy se cambi\u00f3 el tema. No crean que ha sido retraso m\u00edo, y en ese senido pido disculpas al Consejo. Como sabemos, se trata de dar el informe sobre el 48 \u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos. Apenas iniciada la reuni\u00f3n correspondiente, el Comit\u00e9 celebr\u00f3 el ingreso de dos nuevos miembros, dos nuevos pa\u00edses que se integraban al mismo: Sud\u00e1n y Senegal, as\u00ed como de nuevos representantes, todos los cuales son personas altamente calificadas pero caus\u00f3 particular agrado el hecho de que el pa\u00eds sede, Italia, hubiese acreditado al profesor Panebianco, Decano de la Facultad de Derecho de N\u00e0poles, jurista de renombre nacional, con lo cual demuestra el pa\u00eds sede la importancia que atribuye a tener un t\u00e9cnico de alto nivel jur\u00eddico en el Comit\u00e9. Objeto de atenci\u00f3n fue, como ustedes lo saben, el mandato expresado por este Consejo durante su 89\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones de noviembre de 1985, el cual pidi\u00f3 que se analizaran los art\u00edculos 26 y 27 del Reglamento General de la Organizaci\u00f3n para ver si era legalmente aceptable que una regi\u00f3n quedase excluida de uno de los Comit\u00e9s de Finanzas o del Programa no obstante presentar un candidato. Se tuvo presente en la reuni\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 un amplio documento que por desgracia y por fuerza, porque no podr\u00eda ser de otro modo, no ha sido sometido a este Consejo, documento en el cual se analizan los aspectos jur\u00eddicos y los antecedentes del caso. En cuanto a los aspectos jur\u00eddicos, el iter legislativo , como lo llaman los t\u00e9cnicos, est\u00e1 en el documento a disposici\u00f3n del Consejo, o sea el CL 90/5 de los p\u00e1rrafos 6 a 13. Los miembros del Consejo ya lo habr\u00e1n le\u00eddo y no ser\u00eda necesario entrar en el detalle. -471- Habr\u00e1n advertido que el proceso de dictar las normas actualmente en vigor empez\u00f3 con el nombramiento de un grupo de trabajo por el Consejo en su 68\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones de noviembre de 1975 y culmin\u00f3 en el 19\u00b0 per\u00edodo de la Conferencia en 1977. Hay a este respecto en todo este proceso dos puntos que conviene anotar, si bien es verdad que es recurrente en todo ese proceso el deseo de lograr \"una\", cito textualmente, \"distribuci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica equitativa\", fin de la cita; es igualmente cierto que ni en el esp\u00edritu y mucho menos en la letra de las disposiciones en vigor exista la obligaci\u00f3n de elegir a un representante de cada regi\u00f3n que presente una candidatura. En principio, pues, las normas vigentes permiten la posibilidad de que cualquier regi\u00f3n, cualquiera, pueda quedar excluida de uno o incluso de ambos de esos Comit\u00e9s. En cuanto a los antecedentes de hecho, o sea la pr\u00e1ctica seguida analizada en los p\u00e1rrafos 14 a 18 se demuestra en ella que han habido casos de exclusi\u00f3n de regiones por no presentar candidatos o porque el candidato presentado no result\u00f3 electo. Ha habido, por lo general, la distribuci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica equitativa que, como dec\u00eda, parece ser una aspiraci\u00f3n del proceso de elaboraci\u00f3n de las actuales normas, pero \u00e9sa ha sido obviamente basada en las negociaciones que oportunamente se han realizado en la regi\u00f3n. Con esa base, las conclusiones del Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos, tal como se desprende del documento que tienen ante ustedes, son las siguientes: En el p\u00e1rrafo 20 se encuentra la primera conclusi\u00f3n y ser\u00eda en este sentido: \"no s\u00f3lo el proceso de elaboraci\u00f3n, o como he dicho hace un momento, lo que los juristas llaman el iter legislativo de los art\u00edculos XXVI. 3 y XXVII. 3, sino tambi\u00e9n la pr\u00e1ctica, llevan a la convicci\u00f3n de que, y subrayo esta frase, tal como est\u00e1n las normas actualmente no es obligatorio elegir a un representante de cada regi\u00f3n que se presente como candidato\". Segunda conclusi\u00f3n: La conveniencia de mantenerla, y cito de nuevo entre comillas \"la representaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica justa y equitativa y que su mejor realizaci\u00f3n-esta es la opini\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9-la mejor realizaci\u00f3n de esa representaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica justa y equitativa se obtendr\u00eda si cada regi\u00f3n quedara incluida en los Comit\u00e9s si as\u00ed lo desean\". Por consiguiente, el Comit\u00e9 consider\u00f3 que si el Consejo deseaba asegurar legalmente, si deseaba que jur\u00eddicamente quedase asegurada la inclusi\u00f3n en los Comit\u00e9s de cada regi\u00f3n interesada deb\u00eda por fuerza reforzar el normamiento, las reglas que est\u00e1n vigentes. Para ello el Comit\u00e9, sujeto naturalmente a esa decisi\u00f3n de tipo pol\u00edtico que el Consejo desear\u00eda si lo tiene conveniente tomar, sugiere las tres alternativas que se encuentran al final del documento; cada una de ellas tiene ventajas y desventajas. La primera que incluye el aumento del numero de miembros en los Comit\u00e9s tiene inconvenientes, naturalmente, de tipo financiero, pero esos inconvenientes, seg\u00fan se dijo en el Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos, no son los de mayor peso porque las cifras que se podr\u00edan aumentar son de una entidad poco considerable. Realmente el inconveniente de esa soluci\u00f3n es de un orden pol\u00edtico pr\u00e1ctico, o sea que se tendr\u00eda que entrar a una complicada y quiz\u00e1 interminable negociaci\u00f3n sobre a qui\u00e9n y en qu\u00e9 forma corresponder\u00edan los nuevos miembros, a cu\u00e1les regiones tendr\u00edan que atribuirse un mayor numero de miembros. -472- La segunda alternativa tiene la ventaja de que no aumenta el numero de miembros, pero se presta, como est\u00e1 dicho en el documento, a que se de el absurdo de que un pa\u00eds que obtenga un alto n\u00famero de votos no sea elegido y que, en cambio, otro que resulte con un n\u00famero reducido de adhesiones pase a formar parte del Comit\u00e9; eso ser\u00eda realmente un absurdo tanto desde el punto de vista democr\u00e1tico como legal. La tercera soluci\u00f3n a plantear como posible es la que menos problemas presentar\u00eda. El \u00fanico inconveniente que presenta es que volver\u00eda m\u00e1s lento el proceso de votaci\u00f3n si es que en un caso determinado no hubiese acuerdo dentro de una regi\u00f3n sobre sus posibles candidatos. Finalmente, la \u00faltima conclusi\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 es que como \u00e9sta es una cuesti\u00f3n pol\u00edtica que primero debe resolver el Consejo, el Comit\u00e9 se abstuvo de presentar un texto, una propuesta de reforma a los textos legales en vista de que \u00e9sta deber\u00e1 ser hecha s\u00f3lo si el Consejo decide reformar el Reglamento vigente. Quisiera detenerme unos breves segundos en una cuesti\u00f3n que nuestra delegaci\u00f3n se ha permitido plantear en una nota verbal que fue circulada ayer, porque hay algunos aspectos que quiz\u00e1 merezcan ser aclarados. Esta idea incluida en esa nota verbal es una vieja idea que incluso nuestra delegaci\u00f3n quiso presentar en la Conferencia pasada como un proyecto de resoluci\u00f3n y se abstuvo de hacerlo por dos consideraciones fundamentales: una, porque se nos dijo que en ese momento se estaba hablando de hacer econom\u00edas y que proponer eventuales nuevos gastos no era oportuno. Segunda, y \u00e9sta fue la raz\u00f3n m\u00e1s importante, porque hubiera parecido que ten\u00edamos un inter\u00e9s personal en que en ese momento se aprobara una resoluci\u00f3n que, como es lo que se deduce de la idea circulada, autorizar\u00eda el pago de gastos de viaje y permanencia en Roma a los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos como es el caso de los Comit\u00e9s de Finanzas y del Programa. Por esas dos razones, porque se hablaba entonces de crisis econ\u00f3mica y para no aparecer defendiendo un inter\u00e9s personal nos abstuvimos de presentarla durante la Conferencia pasada. La segunda raz\u00f3n por la cual hemos expuesto esta idea es que para m\u00ed personalmente es la \u00faltima oportunidad que tengo de ponerla a la consideraci\u00f3n del Consejo a fin de que si el Consejo la considera una idea digna de atenci\u00f3n pueda seguir el procedimiento normal que la llevar\u00eda a que sea resuelta definitivamente en la pr\u00f3xima Conferencia. Si esa Conferencia resuelve modificar el actual Reglamento en beneficio del Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos no ser\u00e1 un servidor de ustedes, y probablemente los otros miembros, los que disfrutaremos de los beneficios, sino nuestros sucesores. Quiero dejar en claro que no he pensado en ning\u00fan momento, no lo podr\u00edamos hacer, proponer esto como un nuevo punto de la agenda, claro que eso ser\u00eda completamente fuera de orden; es s\u00f3lo lanzar una idea al Consejo y ustedes saben que ideas nuevas surgen en cualquier momento, en cualquier reuni\u00f3n. Depender\u00e1 de los miembros del Consejo recogerla, considerarla si lo estiman oportuno y digna de ser discutida y someterla en ese caso a los \u00f3rganos competentes; en ning\u00fan momento hemos pensado que se va a resolver en este Consejo el fondo de la cuesti\u00f3n. En mi condici\u00f3n de Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos y dedicado, como estoy, al Derecho, me parece que la idea propuesta viene en beneficio del Co mit\u00e9, y, en consecuencia, en beneficio de la Organizaci\u00f3n; de ah\u00ed que me he permitido lanzarla. -473- En este momento estamos hablando de ahorro, estamos hablando de crisis, lo s\u00e9, pero la crisis no ser\u00e1 permanente; adem\u00e1s, sabemos todos que por pobres que seamos a veces hay gastos indispensables que realizar. Disculpen este par\u00e9ntesis pero como, repito, me parece que el proponer una idea muy juiciosa va en beneficio de un Organismo que considero importante para la Organizaci\u00f3n y que simplemente dejo en manos del Consejo para que sean sus miembros quienes determinen si vale la pena discutirla en el futuro o no. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie M. Alvarenga, Pr\u00e9sidente du introductif soulev\u00e9 (Brazil): My delegation has given due consideration and study to the analysis and alternatives put forward by the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters in document CL 90/5. Nevertheless, all that being weighed and balanced, we consider the present composition of appropriate to perform the highly important duties that they have to deal with. That being so, my delegation's understanding is that no modification should be introduced, either in the composition or in the procedural aspects of the election of members. If one analyses the historical background of the work of both Committees, one is led to the conclusion that among others reasons for its efficiency are precisely the number of members, which is small and adequate, and the procedures for election, which afford an appropriate even representation of the various regions. If it has usually been working well and the problems which gave rise for the consultation to the CCLM were an isolated episode, my delegation can see no good reason for modifying a winning team. On the other hand, it seems to us that the true nature of the present issue is of political rather than legal origin. I do not think it worthwhile to extend myself on this subject, since this Council is not the appropriate forum to discuss it and the whole issue should be referred to the Conference. Mrs. Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): 1 would like to read a very short statement, and despite the charming remarks of my dear colleague, usually for my own statements I take off my glasses, and stop reading what I have received from Washington. But in all cases I do hope that nobody in this room thinks that my personal observations, although perhaps couched in a little warmer language than the official language which comes from Washington since 1 am a loyal public servant and I do not say here everything that I may have in my heart-are not just really in my heart, but also in accord, since I am a loyal public servant, with the instructions that my Government has given me on each of these issues. It is just that I phrase them a little differently. So I would like to say in this light that my Government and I attach great importance to this issue. I do not see it as political. I see it, as has been well said in the document, as a matter of just and equitable geographic representation. What are the regions? They are the Near East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia. That is one group of regions. No one is suggesting that that membership should be changed in any way. Certainly my Government does not require that I do and I personally do not think that we should, certainly not here and now, whatever the Committee may decide. -474- What is the other group-Europe, North America and South-West Pacific. I think that does represent equitable geographic distribution. That is what we are looking for. We cannot sit here day after day bandying around political games. We have to talk about issues, principles, and a just and equitable division of representation of the different areas of this globe. Surely that is a principle. We do not have to question it and call it political. It is a principle. Are three hundred million people to have no representative? What would we say if we were doing this to Africa-outrage, yes--three hundred million people and no representative! Just and equitable, and that is personal, my Government did not tell me to say that. What it says in paragraph 21, the desirability of maintaining a just and equitable geographic representation on the Committee and each region should be represented if it wishes to be. We are talking about justice and equity. I really think it would be regrettable if North America did not have any representation on this important Finance Committee. We strongly support this view in paragraph 21, and if we are going to go further I wish that we would, here in this Council, give clear guidance to the CCLM that the regulations should such a way, or to guarantee such representation, and not to try and change the composition of the Committees. We understand the various delicacies of this, but we do believe that the principle of equitable geographic representation must be maintained and stuck to and upheld. Of the various options in document CL 90/5 our Government is perfectly satisfied with alternative 3, confident that the changes that will bring about the just and equitable situation can be achieved under alternative 3. I urge my colleagues to support this. This is not some fancy principle that n obody has ever heard of. This is a perfectly accepted international equity, not law, but a theory that must be upheld, and if we do not uphold it here where will it find its et juridiques (document CL nous du Conseil. Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Democratic Republic of) (original language Arabic): We have studied the conclusions contained in the report of the Forty-Eighth Session of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters, and in particular the three solutions proposed. My delegation believes that there is no need to introduce any change in the composition of the two Committees in question, nor in the method of election of the members to these Committees. We therefore feel that there is no problem, that there will be no difficulties, that there is an implicit agreement between countries, which makes it possible for the regions to be represented, as is the case for election of members of CFA. I think the procedures have been accepted by everybody. From that point of view I think the CCLM should study this matter again and we could then discuss the whole issue at a future session. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): We have carefully studied this document and I am grateful to Ambassador Alvarenga for his very lucid presentation and I am happy for having contributed to the elaboration of this proposal to the Council. I must say that in the resum\u00e9 of the history of what happened in the two Committees-and I refer to the Finance Committee, I have no comment on the Programme Committee's composition, I limit my remarks the Finance Committee, on which Italy is a member-coming to this document, paragraph 18, and I quote: \"With respect to the second stage of the election to the Finance Committee, each region had obtained one seat in all cases, except in 1985 when Europe gained two seats. \" It is true that Europe gained two seats, but it happened before many times that Europe -475- had more than one candidate. The attempt is always made to reach an agreement, a consultation, but it is not necessarily successful. For the particular case of the Host Government the members of this Council may not be completely aware of the facts. Over four decades in that Committee for fourteen years, sixteen years, eight years without any rotation, without any change. Because of that we strongly support a revision of the present procedures for the election to the Committee without altering the number of the members, because we are very happy with nine members, we have been working very nicely, and I think we accomplished the result that was placed by the members of the Council. Looking at the alternatives that are presented by the CCLM, I strongly support the views of the delegation of the United States concerning the acceptab ility of alternative 3. We are decidedly in favour of this alternative. I would go even beyond the pure support. We believe that it was a tremendous accident that North America was not represented in our Committee, but on that occasion Italy did not think that it was right to renounce and to withdraw its candidature. We did it. There were democratic elections. We were elected. But we regretted profoundly that because of our election one region was out, and one very important region for our Organization. The countries of this region are at the birthplace and the first seat of the Organization and their contribution to this Organization is extremely high. With due regard to the opinion of the Chairman of the Committee, who said that alternative 3 would imply a slower voting process, that is not We have speeches here and interventions that would last for twenty-five minutes or thirty minutes, and we could spend half an hour to adjust the membership of this Committee without altering the number. My proposal now would be as follows; the Council in our opinion should give guidelines to the Committee so that this alternative be translated into legal wording, and presented to the next Council, so that we can submit it to the Conference-the only body that can decide. I do not venture to propose the specific legal wording because it is not my job and I do not want to burden this session. However, I would say that the first stage would be to elect a Chairman. The second stage would be dedicated to the election of the representative of the six remaining regions, with the prerogative for a region not to be represented if it does not wish to be represented. The second stage of the election would proceed in accordance with present procedures. In order to safeguard the balance between the two groups of regions, I would even venture to say that if there are only two remaining vacant seats one should go to one group of regions and one seat to the other group. If there is no agreement the candidate with the highest votes would be elected. If there are three or more, then we would be satisfied if the group of regions- Europe, North America and South West Pacific, were given one of the remaining seats and the other remaining seat should be given to the other four regions. Ronald F. R. DEARE (United Kingdom): I shall be very brief. First of all I should like to say that I agree with my distinguished colleague from the United States when she says that this is not a political issue that we have before us today. It is, as she has said, and as the Committee has recognized, a matter of just and equitable geographical treatment. My delegation believes that it is inconceivable that there should be no representative of this major region on the Finance Committee. I was much encouraged by what the distinguished Ambassador of Italy has just said. I think that his proposal is an excellent one with which I can certainly agree. I would urge the Council to reflect very on the effect that rejection of this very reasonable request might have on those who are already highly critical of the way in which the United Nations conducts its affairs. I do not think we of that fact. My delegation can certainly support the proposal that we should ask the Committee to flesh out and present us with detailed texts on Alternative 3. -476- Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of) (original language Arabic): The question that we are concerned about is a very sensitive and delicate matter from all points of view. If we look at the memberships of these two very important committees, I think it would be desirable for them to be elected in their personal capacity in view of their experience, their efficiency and their personal ability to cope with the problems put before these committees. In other words, the person very cautiously, irrespective of the geographical region he or she may represent. This our opinion in general dealing particularly with the Finance Committee, it is made up of members whose numbers are absolutely in line with the GRO. Including the Chairman, there are 9 members and I think we should keep to that number. The Finance Committee is a committee with particular rules of procedure which deal with economic and financial matters. It studies tables, and figures. The members of this committee should be capable of carrying manner. Therefore we would not agree with an the number of of the Finance Committee, or a Programme Committee because of financial reasons. also have political repercussions, as each region would then ask for an confusion; which we would like to avoid at any cost. I feel great sympathy for, and agree with my colleague, the Ambassador of the U. S. A. It is a question of basic principles. We have followed these principles for years and have applied them clearly. The principle was clearly enunciated in paragraph 7 where it spells out, without any room for doubt, that the second phase would bring in 3 members from Europe, North America and the South West Pacific. In other words, three regions and only three candidates. Therefore, it is very simple, reasonable and logical to maintain these numbers. How can we maintain them? This is our major concern. We have got to reach agreement between the three regions. The three regions and the Government representatives must have some sort of gentlemen's agreement to nominate three candidates only. If agreement could not be reached for whatever reason, this is a perfectly natural situation which has nothing to do with politics or-there may be misunderstandings or there may be divergence of opinion. Last year, for example, Europe asked for two seats, North America and the South West Pacific asked for one seat each, at which point we had four candidates for three seats-how should we proceed? At that point four candidates had to be elected for three seats, one from Europe instead of two would seem more reasonable. Subsequently, the Council members must these candidates for Europe, then chooses two candidates for the South West Pacific and North America. I think that this is reasonable. This is an agreement that can be reached, it is a gentlemen's agreement which we ought to support-and I think that Council ought to take this situation into account. Concerning the third alternative which we have looked at, we feel that this provides the best solution of those which have been put to us. First of all we should like some clarification on this. We would like more information in order to be able to state our final position more clearly. Those are our comments on the matter. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I should like to make a very brief intervention. We agree that it is important that a just and equitable representation system for these very important committees be found. In looking at the very interesting and thorough paper prepared by the Constitutional Committee we should just like to make a couple of observations. Our resulting feeling after looking at that paper can be summed-up by saying that we feel that the system should not become unduly complex, or at least any more complex, than it is at the moment. Australia could accept continuation of the present system if that were the general view. However, we feel that all regions should be justly represented, if they wish to be. Also, we do not favour increasing the numbers on any of these committees or the cost, involved in doing so. -477- Having that, my delegation does not have particularly strong views on the alternatives before us. We think that all of them would adequately prevent the sort of problem that occurred Finance Committee was elected before. However, we certainly could support alternative 3, if that were the view that the Council came to. We feel that this would be a satisfactory process. We do not feel that the slightly more complicated voting procedure that would be It would be possible to have the first round of votes in the first week of the meeting of Conference, and then the second round of voting later in the meeting. Therefore, we do not feel that that is a particularly strong objection. Victor HJORT (Denmark): The Danish delegation is grateful to the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters for the examination reported on in document CL 90/5. From the examination carried out on the election procedures to the Programme and Finance Committees, we take note of the Rules and the practice established in the past. Although the rules do not provide for an a priori regional distribution of seats, practice has shown, with few exceptions, that an equitable and reasonable representation has been achieved. One notable exception however was that North America, much to the regret of my Government, did not obtain representation on the Finance Committee at the last election. In the opinion of my delegation, it is most important that an equitable regional distribution of seats is achieved in the two committees. Furthermore, it is our belief that this goal is possible within the existing framework, as experience has shown us. We believe that an amendment to the rules at the present stage involves a process of decision-making in the Governing Bodies of FAO, which could be difficult to achieve and there could be some legal consequences which are difficult to assess. For this reason my delegation recommends that the regional groupings themselves, as in the past, make an effort in their respective decisions in presenting regional groupings Finally, referring to the last remarks by the Chairman of the CCLM in his introductory statement, my delegation is not in of changing the rules of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters. Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (original language Arabic): 1 have carefully listened to the introductior of the item by his Excellency the Ambassador and Chairman of the CCLM, and I closely studied document CL 90/5. I think present Finance Committees should be maintained-as consequences. The subject should be reexamined in the light of the pertinent views and opinions to be submitted to this body at its next session in June 1987. Mohammed ABDELHADI (Tunisie) (langue chaque \u00eatre de r\u00e8gle de la de l'Organisation. En ce qui concerne la deuxi\u00e8me solution, nous ne pas. Nous like to support what the delegate of Brazil and others explained to us so precisely. We believe this is not the appropriate moment for changes in the Programme and Finance Committees. Let these Committees fufilltheir duties and their mandate. We are therefore not in favour of any change in these Committees at the moment. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): We are a little hesitant because this is a sensitive subject on which it is not very easy to make up our minds, but we can say that my delegation is a fervent supporter of a just and equitable geographical representation in every organ and governing body of our Organization. This is a principle to which we are fully attached. Starting from this point, and addressing the composition of the Finance Committee, in the Finance Committee we are inclined to think that the non-representation of one region is not very desirable, especially if this region has a particular weight. Therefore, if the Council feels it should take later procedural steps we would go along with any solution which will ensure the reconciliation of the principle of representation and the factor I have just mentioned. But we are in favour of this solution not because, as my United Kingdom friend said, if we do not find such solution we will hurt the feelings of a big country; we are for this solution because we are for justice and equity. 1 wanted to make this clear. Secondly, addressing this to the member countries if better coordination were possible among the various groups, we would not have this problem today. 1 wanted to make point Felix F. MALUZA (Zambia):My delegation has studied the paper before us, document CL 90/5, and we are satisfied with the deliberations of the Committee. My delegation believes that in any Committee on the work of FAO or in any other UN agencies the principle of regional, just and equitable representation should be respected, followed and adhered to. This the only way the views and interests of each region can be taken care of for the well-being of humanity. As was recognised in paragraph 9 of the document before us, Resolution 15/77 of the Nineteenth FAO Conference did not meet the principle of equitable geographical distribution. Paragraph 9 of the 48th Session of the Committee of Constitutional and Legal Matters recognises this fact. There need, therefore, to remedy the anomaly. My delegation feels that the time has come for us to allocate seats to each region. This is the only way in which we can get rid of the unfortunate instances which are now happening. My delegation does not believe in a gentlemen's agreement as far as this case is concerned since this creates misunderstandings and unnecessary problems, evident. therefore give a -479- mandate to the to work out the necessary logistics. The Committee membership could still remain at nine as it is now but allocating seats to regions. The personal merits of the representatives should be considered in these elections, as now. While the examination and study of logistics is being undertaken by the CCLM the regional grouping should ensure that there is representation in all FAO Committees. The CCLM should report back to us at the Ninety-First Council. Robbie Matango MUPAWOSE (ZIMBABWE): We thank the Chairman of the CCLM for his presentation of the issues in this document. Having fully which expressed by our neighbour, both geographically and also sitting next to us in this house, we fully agree with those views and with those sentiments. We do not see how a lack of clearly-defined regional representation can ever be considered equitable. In other deliberations in this house we have been talking repeatedly about the need for regional interests and regional representation and we cannot understand why this should not be taken in that same vein. Because of the shortage of time we will not go into deta il, but we fully s upport Alternative 3 and would recommend that this Council request the CCLM to put together the different modalities which will be required so that presentation can be made to the Council and to the Conference next year. K. R. HIGHAM (Canada): The existing Regulations have been in force for a long time and as far as I know there has never been any pressure to change them. The spirit of this Regulation has always been respected by a gentlemen's agreement, as the delegate of Zambia put it, and there was never any need to reconsider the Regulation. Something happened, however, at the last Council-1 am not sure what, I was not here-and there seems to have been a change in that spirit. As a result, this question has come before us. Our instincts in Canada, and I think many share them, are not to meddle or tamper with Regulations unnecessarily. However, if Regulations to protect in strictly legal terms the spirit of the intent, then certainly Alternative 3 seems to us to be the best way to proceed. Apart from that, I should say that we have particularly strong views whether we keep the existing Regulation or whether we go for Alternative 3. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia desea rendir un sincero homenaje de reconocimiento y de gratitud a nuestro colega, amigo y hermano en la fraternidad latinoamericana, el embajador Alvarenga de El Salvador, quien dej\u00f3 importantes tareas que cumplir en su pa\u00eds para venirnos a presentar este informe con la competencia y lucidez que le han caracterizado en el ejercicio de sus funciones de Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia est\u00e1 de acuerdo con nuestra colega Fenwick, de los Estados Unidos, en el sentido de que se trata de un asunto importante que conviene solucionar favorablemente. Queremos declarar que en la elecci\u00f3n del Consejo en la cual se produjo el resultado que ha originado este debate, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n lament\u00f3 de manera muy sincera que una importante regi\u00f3n no estuviese representada en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la importancia de la regi\u00f3n y del respeto y la admiraci\u00f3n que nos merece Canad\u00e1, el pa\u00eds que no result\u00f3 elegido. -480- Perm\u00edtasenos tambi\u00e9n agregar un sentimiento de personal amistad que nos une al se\u00f1or Musgrove, a quien reconocemos en el ejercicio de sus funciones de miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas gran consagraci\u00f3n y notable inter\u00e9s, pero creemos que todo esto deba considerarse en un marco razonable, sereno y objetivo con algo de cuidado. En cuanto a los argumentos que puedan esgrimirse, sobre todo a la luz de dos declaraciones, la primera de nuestra colega Fenwick, de los Estados Unidos, quien habl\u00f3 de 300 millones de habitantes, este es un hecho, pero a la luz del principio democr\u00e1tico seg\u00fan el cual todos ios habitantes del planeta somos iguales, si aceptamos el principio de que por 300 millones de habitantes de Norteam\u00e9rica deba haber un miembro del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, nuestro colega de la izquierda, China, tendr\u00eda derecho a tres y medio miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, tres y medio miembros; India tendr\u00eda derecho a dos y medio miembros. Tambi\u00e9n nos preocup\u00f3, y lo decimos con buen esp\u00edritu, la declaraci\u00f3n del colega Deare, del Reino Unido. No creemos que este Consejo pueda deliberar bajo la espada de Damocles; no creemos que sea aceptable que se nos diga que si rechazamos una u otra acci\u00f3n vamos a tener dificultades y a destruir el sistema de Naciones Unidas. Lo que \u00e9l ha dicho que la cuesti\u00f3n no es pol\u00edtica, se contradice con esa afirmaci\u00f3n. De manera que proponemos formalmente que ninguna de esas partes de esas declaraciones figuren en nuestro proyecto de informe para que podamos estudiar esto de manera muy concreta, serena y objetiva. El embajador Pascarelli nos comunic\u00f3 un alegre despertar de Italia que decidi\u00f3, muy justamente ahora perten ecer al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y, naturalmente, como conocemos algunos ant ecedentes podr\u00edamos interpretar de manera muy flexible la declaraci\u00f3n del colega Pascarelli como una especie de acto de contrici\u00f3n, como un leve sentido de culpabilidad. De todas maneras, el delegado de Italia al apoyar la opci\u00f3n tres hizo unas elucubraciones que son complicadas por que yo creo que no ser\u00eda justo que para solucionar problemas de un respetable grupo de pa\u00edses se nos creen dificultades a otro grupos de pa\u00edses que, bien o mal, nos hemos venido adaptando a las nuevas disposiciones para la elecci\u00f3n de los miembros de esos Co mit\u00e9s, aunque en ocasiones algunas de nuestras regiones hayan presentado m\u00e1s candidatos de los dos que les corresponden en el Comit\u00e9 del Programa, por ejemplo, y sin embargo nos hemos acomodado y hoy d\u00eda hemos logrado que cada una de las cuatro regiones de pa\u00edses en desarrollo tengan dos representantes. Cambiar el sistema, porque si se cambia el de Finanzas hay que cambiar el del Programa, podr\u00eda crearnos dificultades que conducir\u00edan sobre todo a calificar, a dar una especie de liderazgo a aquel representante de cada regi\u00f3n que fuera elegido en la primera votaci\u00f3n. El p\u00e1rrafo 18 del documento confirma lo que muchos de nosotros sabemos. Esta es la primera vez que ocurre esto, puede que no se siga repitiendo y a lo mejor entonces no podr\u00eda justificarse ninguna n ecesidad de cambio. Pensamos, en cambio, que en nuestro informe debe incluirse textualmente atribuida a la opini\u00f3n del Consejo la primera frase del p\u00e1rrafo 21, la primera frase del p\u00e1rrafo 21, todos la conocemos, debe incluirse en nuestro informe. Queremos sumarnos a lo que han dicho, sobre todo al principio, la delegaci\u00f3n de Saudi Arabia, Dinamarca y otras muchas en que el problema principal consiste en que los grupos regionales deben tratar de hacer intensos esfuerzos para ponerse de acuerdo y no crear dificultades a los dem\u00e1s. Los distinguidos colegas de pa\u00edses desarrollados son menos numero de pa\u00edses, se entienden muy bien entre ellos, se re\u00fanen, como grupo de Ginebra, como OCDE, pueden ponerse de acuerdo. Habl\u00e9 ya de c\u00f3mo manejamos los pa\u00edses en desarrollo nuestra elecci\u00f3n en el Co mit\u00e9 del Programa; en el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil para nosotros porque tenemos seis puestos y somos cuatro regiones y sin embargo hemos logrado, mediante acuerdos de caballeros, hacer actitud alternativa entre unas y otras regiones de manera que ese buen ejemplo de los 77, debe seguir en el seno de la OCDE. De las tres posibilidades que se nos han presentado la menos mala, la menos mala, no digo la mejor, la menos mala es la tres, la menos mala es la tres. -481- Muchos colegas han dicho que el CACJ debe seguir estudiando este asunto; yo estoy de acuerdo con el p\u00e1rrafo 28 del documento. En el p\u00e1rrafo 28 el CACJ pr\u00e1cticamente dice que agot\u00f3 sus posibilidades y que cualquier asunto posterior corresponde a decisiones pol\u00edticas del Consejo y de la Conferencia. Sin embargo creo que hay que ser justos y razonables con los colegas que insisten en buscar soluciones, y por ello creemos que ser\u00eda razonable que a la luz de lo que aparezca en el informe de esta reuni\u00f3n del Consejo, de esta reuni\u00f3n del Consejo se decida por la Secretar\u00eda, el Consejo mismo, el CACJ si aun puede seguir estudiando este asunto y as\u00ed tendr\u00edamos nuevas consideraciones en el Consejo de junio de 1987 y finalmente en la Conferencia de noviembre 1987. Estoy tratando de leer, desafortunadamente no hablo en ingl\u00e9s (le interrumpe la se\u00f1ora delegada de Estados Unidos fuera de micr\u00f3fono). Yo agradezco mucho la aclaraci\u00f3n de la distinguida colega Fenwick, yo no conozco, a pesar de que tengo muy buenos amigos en la OCDE, hoy presidida por el embajador Posier, es uno de mis colegas m\u00e1s cercanos en esta Organizaci\u00f3n, pero no conozco exactamente c\u00f3mo funciona pero s\u00e9 que se re\u00fanen, que con frecuencia no se ponen de acuerdo, claro que est\u00e1n en contacto. Creemos que esta es la actitud razonable; despu\u00e9s del debate que hemos tenido veremos qu\u00e9 se puede incluir en el informe y luego el CACJ podr\u00e1 recibir instrucciones del Consejo a trav\u00e9s del informe o del Director General para seguirse ocupando de este asuntp. Sobre la Nota Verbal que recibimos ayer, creemos que el CACJ, junto con el Comit\u00e9 del Programa y del de Finanzas, son los tres \u00f3rganos asesores permanentes m\u00e1s importantes del Consejo. En el pasado, hace muchos a\u00f1os inclusive hab\u00eda dificultades para lograr los 7 miembros, uno por cada regi\u00f3n que integraban el CACJ, pero con el transcurrir del tiempo el CACJ ha aumentado en importancia, lo demuestra el informe y las consideraciones del Presidente Alvarenga y convendr\u00e1 que cuando sea oportuno el Consejo, el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas y el propio CACJ se ocupen de la posibilidad de igualar las condiciones del Presidente y de los miembros a aqu\u00e9llas de los Comit\u00e9s del Programa y de Finanzas. Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo): Je j'ai au cours cours de la session pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente eu des \u00e9lections se sont gauche, l'Ambassadeur a de \u00e9lections de genre. Je pour ma part maintenant, plus possible, je souscrirais pour ma part \u00e0 ce elle est favorable \u00e0 ce statu quo plus pour des raisons n\u00e9gatives que pour des raisons positives, en avons la plus grande consid\u00e9ration, et dont l'importance est incontestable, quand ce pays, qui compte environ 16 millions d'habitants, et dont la contribution est de 1, 90 pour cent du budget, dispose \u00e0 financier? de la r\u00e9gion Europe qui compte 526 millions d'habitants et du Nord, qui compte 262 millions d'habitants et 28, 72 pour cent des contributions. Il y a donc d'un cet\u00e9 un si\u00e8ge si\u00e8ge pour d'habitants risque Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Yo voy a ser muy breve, como de costumbre, para decir apenas dos cosas. Primero, que estamos demostrando con la intervenci\u00f3n de Francia, la cual apoyamos totalmente, y con las otras personas que est\u00e1n interviniendo en relaci\u00f3n con la distribuci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica, que este no es realmente un criterio tampoco a seguir. Ya nos has demostrado el Embajador de Colombia cu\u00e1ntos representantes tendr\u00edamos que darle a Asia, que tiene no solamente a China y a India, sino que al Jap\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n tenemos que meterle ah\u00ed. Entonces, si vamos a colocarnos en esta posici\u00f3n de hablar de los millones de habitantes, tampoco vamos a estar muy satisfechos porque tambi\u00e9n America latina tiene sus 400 millones, sin contar los que no figuran en los censos, que son todos esos desheredados de la fortuna que viven en condiciones tan absolutalente primitivas y al margen de la civilizaci\u00f3n que ni siquiera llegan all\u00ed los censores, y por eso decimos del Per\u00fa, cu\u00e1ntos en la Amazonia del Brasil, cu\u00e1ntos en el \u00e1rea de la selva de Guyana de Venezuela que son ind\u00edgenas? Entonces, no nos resulta eso del n\u00famero de habitantes porque no va a ser equitativo. Podr\u00edamos asumir otra posici\u00f3n que es el numero de pa\u00edses, y entonces vamos a contar con los pa\u00edses que existen en Africa, los que est\u00e1n en Am\u00e9rica Latina, los que est\u00e1n en Asia y siempre vamos a resultar muchos m\u00e1s que los dos de Norteam\u00e9rica. Por esa raz\u00f3n, no tomenos el criterio geogr\u00e1fico porque no nos va a resultar equitativo, lamentando mucho que mi amiga la Embajadora de Estados Unidos piense que eso es lo que llama geogr\u00e1fico y no pol\u00edtico. Yo debo decir aqu\u00ed, como ge\u00f3grafo que soy, porque esa es mi profesi\u00f3n, que la geograf\u00eda tambi\u00e9n tiene su pol\u00edtica, y que la geograf\u00eda pol\u00edtica, la cual se ha tenido tambi\u00e9n de geopol\u00edtica, tiene sus vueltas y revueltas que se confunden con lo geogr\u00e1fico. Por esa raz\u00f3n, no nos van a servir esos criterios. Yo voy a estar de acuerdo con que nosotros mejor dejemos la situaci\u00f3n como est\u00e1 y en el futuro veamos c\u00f3mo se resuelve el problema de las regiones que me parece que ser\u00eda, como bien han aseverado los oradores que, m\u00e1s felices que yo lo han dicho antes, que las regiones se pongan de acuerdo. Nosotros tenemos la posibilidad de entrar en este acuerdo antes de presentar las candidaturas y saber que debemos estar representados por regiones sin hacer caso muy estricto del n\u00famero de habitantes de cada pa\u00eds, porque, de esa manera, vamos a tener que cambiar las reglas del juego. Yo me pronuncio, pues, por mantener el documento tal como est\u00e1, sin mengua de que en el futuro puedan estudiarse otras soluciones para ser presentadas al Consejo futuro y a la Conferencia. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): My delegation would like to thank the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters for document CL 90/5 dealing with the legal questions in connection with the membership of the Programme Committee and the Finance Committee. We are grateful to the Committee in particular for the legislative history of the relevant provisions in the General Rules of our Organization. My delegation shares the expert assessment of the Committee which it had undertaken on the result of the elections at the 89th Council session in November 1985. Nevertheless, we very much regretted the election result of this Council session and the related non-representation of one important region from the Finance Committee. On the other hand we agree with the statements in paragraph 19 of document CL 90/5, according to which the application of the pertinent provisions of the Basic Texts had in general worked satisfactorily. For this reason we consider the result of election to the Finance Committee in Nove mber 1985 not to be the last word in the matter. My delegation expresses its thanks to the CCLM for the presentation of the three alternatives contained in paragraphs 22 to 28 to amend the relevant provisions of the general rules. Against the background of the statements in paragraph 19 of the document and the statement we heard this morning here, we see, however, no need at the moment to amend these rules. We believe that the can be solved by means of improved coordination and between the individual regions. In our opinion member states have a interest in not permanently excluding an important world region from the Finance Committee of our Organization. As you know we have always favoured the application of this principle of rotation and we believe that the application of this principle in connection with the improved coordination will in future lead again to the desirable results in the sense of paragraph 19 of the document before us. -484- Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I think the representative of Italy wade it quite clear in a sense that he regretted that with the success of Italy a very important region happened to be excluded. Similarly, the representative of Canada has made it very clear that they do not like lightly to change the rules and there was no insistence on his part that rules should be changed on the basis of geographical representation or otherwise. From what we can see from the papers and from the past record of the Finance Committee, we find that the particular region to which most of the members have been alluding has been represented almost throughout. It is some sort of accident which has taken place because of lack of coordination, and I think that while we must thank the Chairman of the CCLM for his expert paper and labours, the system has worked fairly satisfactorily. We do not want to go into the question of geographical representation because, apart from anything else, every five or six years some of our countries may have the attribute for a new seat because our population keeps increasing and 1 think the point made by people all across, whether from Latin America or from the Chairman of the Finance Committee and indeed, with rare exceptions, that the system has worked well is value and I think one should not lightly change the present pattern. I do not think this is a matter on which the Council can decide. Carlos DINATOR (Observador de Chile): Mi delegaci\u00f3n posee alguna versaci\u00f3n jur\u00eddica y aprecia que la adecuada representaci\u00f3n geografica es un principio pol\u00edtico muy respetable, por cierto, porque encarna ideales de equidad y justicia que el Derecho deber\u00eda recoger. Cree mi delegaci\u00f3n que la representaci\u00f3n geogr\u00e1fica puede tener efectos saludables de acuerdo con lo expresado por los eminentes representantes de Italia y Reino Unido, que ven una asociaci\u00f3n entre la reforma del Reglamento General de la FAO y la situaci\u00f3n financiera y de liquidez general de la Organizaci\u00f3n. El deseo de participar es tambi\u00e9n saludable porque revela inter\u00e9s en la FAO, inter\u00e9s que debemos creer genuino y que no debe ser ignorado. Sin embargo, atendida tal vinculaci\u00f3n de las finanzas en general con el deseo de participar, desear\u00eda mi delegaci\u00f3n conocer si es o no os prerequisito para postular al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas poseer un peque\u00f1o certificado de la Secretar\u00eda en el sentido de que el candidato est\u00e0 al d\u00eda en el pago de las cuotas a la FAO. Si as\u00ed no fuera, mi delegaci\u00f3n estima que la reforma del Reglamento General deber\u00eda tambi\u00e9n establecer tal certificaci\u00f3n porque el manejo de las finanzas supone ciertas obligaciones que la Constituci\u00f3n de la FAO establ ece en relaci\u00f3n con los Estados y en especial respecto de los principales contribuyentes. Felicitamos al Sr. Embajador de El Salvador por la presentaci\u00f3n del documento CL 90/5. Mrs. Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): As you know, sometimes I say 1 am saddened and sometimes I am angry, and I am sorry to say that this time I am angry. I did not expect that when something does not work-according to the preamble of this whole section it is supposed to have a just and equitable geographic distribution. Apparently the regulations, as they are now written, do not provide for this principle which is ensconced in the preamble. It does not work. A s you know, my dear colleagues, that is what interests me-does it work? I should not have mentioned the number of people. I am highly sympathetic to China and Japan and would not like to have any of my remarks suggest that I am not. But they d not seem to be fighting us here. As you notice, I do not mention money either. That is not the point. The point is justice. And then somebody brings up the OECD. That is a political group, a very nice group, they do not support the United States, okay. But we are talking about geography, and OECD is not a geographic region like Latin America and the Caribbean or Europe. I am begging you to recognize this principle, a just and equitable representation. We have other suggestions that people who are up-to-date should always be represented. In that situation on obligations, obviously should have been shooed in unanimously, but we do not use these financial things. -485- I. ALVARENGA (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos): Realmente, no me toca a m\u00ed hacer una conclusi\u00f3n naturalmente del debate. S\u00f3lo quisiera pedir al Comit\u00e9 de Reuacci\u00f3n, tal como acer\u00edadamente se puntualiz\u00f3, que quede claro el mandato que les ha dado el Comit\u00e9 de Asuntos Constitucionales y Jur\u00eddicos, en vista de que me parece que tanto los que est\u00e1n a favor de una reforma como muchos de los que no est\u00e1n a favor de la reforma, han pedido que vuelva el Comit\u00e9 a examinar este punto. Eso ser un poco dif\u00edcil porque, sin un mandato preciso en uno u otro sentido, ser\u00e1 un tanto problem\u00e1tico desentra\u00f1ar qu\u00e9 es lo que el Comit\u00e9 deber\u00e1 considerar; luego pido que ese mandato quede claramente expresado. No quisiera perder la oportunidad de haber usado la palabra para agradecer a quienes se refirieron a nuestro trabajo en manera elogiosa y, en particular, a los que se dirigieron a m\u00ed, personalmente. LE PRESIDENT: Je voudrais \u00e9galement contribuer d\u00e9j\u00e0 deux principes une r\u00e9partition juste et \u00e9quitable dans le Comit\u00e9 financier. Le second est que les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s veulent \u00e9viter une augmentation des membres du Comit\u00e9 le monde est deux dit, peut-on du d'approfondir pour le les solution trois afin de voir si cette solution trois-du r\u00e9partitions \u00e9quitables-peut \u00eatre analys\u00e9e par de pourrait alors \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9rence. Je ne sais pas si ce point de vue est agr\u00e9\u00e9 par le Conseil. Voulez-vous que nous donnions troisi\u00e8me et qu'il pr\u00e9sente un document \u00e0 la prochaine session du Conseil ? Ou y a-t-il une alternative Elio \u00e0 acquis: il ne faut augmenter le nombre des membres du je question au Conseil. -486- Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Creo que conviene que en ese punto se proceda como en todos los dem\u00e1s del Consejo, sin que anticipemos juicios demasiado definitivos. Veremos c\u00f3mo se refleja en el Informe y se proceder\u00e1 de conformidad. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I think it may also be useful to note the sense of the House or Council that there was hardly any debate on the need to alter the Programme Committee. From what I have noticed, there was no mention of this. So at least you can spare the CCLM from deuxi\u00e8mement, nombre le status que l'on maintienne le status quo ? Voil\u00e0 les deux alternatives. Mrs. Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I hesitate to speak again but it seems to me that it has been proved that this does not work. The system that we have has not brought about a just and equitable geographic distribution; it has not worked. What more do we want? We are not saying that we know the perfect answer. We are saying that we have an excellent Committee with a brilliant Chairman that could study the system and bring in legal language or something that would mean that this works. We are asking them not to impose but to propose to the next Council session something that gives a hope of working. Mr. Chairman, you say a preponderance. 1 do not know. I have not counted. We have two members here who say that if they are changed they would like to see alternative 3. I do not know where they can be counted, somewhere in the middle. But I have added it up, listening, and I find a preponderance on the exprim\u00e9es, les et les approfondir. Puis, en juin, think we are spending too much time on this. There are still many agenda items on the table. I believe we can accept your conclusion of the debate, Mr. Chairman We can just say the first two alternatives are out, nobody wanted change in the text. Then, as you say, we will ask the CCLM to study the possibilities of alternative 3. Gabriel MACKO (Czechoslovakia): On behalf of Czechoslovakia some consideration about the problem discussed. This debate on the report of the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters is very important and interesting for the countries, which are members of FAO from Eastern Europe. We take the opportunity to remind the Council that tradition in electing the members of the Council has been broken during the last Conference of FAO. From the 1st of Januar y 1987, these countrie s will be represented in the Council only by one delegation. Since traditionally they have not been elected into the Programme Committee, or into the Finance Committee, we think that the tradition, according to which they have so far been represented in the Council by two countries, should be restored during the next solution afin de la soumettre \u00e0 un nouvel examen du Conseil en juin. Il est entendu, comme l'a dit le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de l'Inde, n'est pas impliqu\u00e9 dans cette \u00e9tude. 16. Autres questions constitutionnelles et juridiques, notamment : 16.

A. FLORES RODAS (Subdirector General, Departamento de Montes): Me refiero al documento CL 90/13-Rev. l a la disposici\u00f3n del Consejo. El Comit\u00e9 de Desarrollo Forestal en los Tr\u00f3picos fue esta blecido por el Director General en 1966 en virtud de la Resoluci\u00f3n 7/65 del 13\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones de la Conferencia. Su objetivo principal era el de lograr que la| FAO obtuviera el asesoramiento necesario para es timular el aumento de la productividad y de la utilizaci\u00f3n de los bosques tropicales del mundo. El numero de sus miembros estaba limitado entonces a un m\u00e1ximo de 30 Estados Miembros y miembros asociados de la Organizaci\u00f3n, representativos de las distintas re giones del mundo. Posterio rmente, en 1976, tal l\u00edmite se increment\u00f3 a 45, en virtud de la Resoluci\u00f3n 5/70 del Consejo, como consecuencia de un estudio realizado por el Director General a petici\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9, sobre el inter\u00e9s mostrado por los Estados Miembros de la Organizaci\u00f3n por formar parte del Comit\u00e9. Ya para esta fecha, cuando se aument\u00f3 el n\u00famero de miembros, no fue posible incluir a cinco pa\u00edses que deseaban formar parte del Comit\u00e9. Posteriormente, otros pa\u00edses solicitaron ser miembros y tampoco fue posible incorporarlos. -489- Desde 1976 a la f echa, el inter\u00e9s pol\u00edtico y publico sobre la importancia del desarrollo sostenido de los recursos forestales ha crecido considerablemente. El papel de la FAO, como la Organizaci\u00f3n l\u00edder en el campo forestal, tambi\u00e9n ha crecido correspondientemente, tal como lo reflejaron entre otros, la declaraci\u00f3n por este Consejo de 1985 como A\u00f1o Internacional del Bosque y el dise\u00f1o, desarrollo y puesta en pr\u00e1ctica del Plan de Acci\u00f3n Forestal en los Tr\u00f3picos en el que nuevamente se recalca la funci\u00f3n central de la FAO en la armonizaci\u00f3n de las tareas relativas a su ejecuci\u00f3n. Es evidente, que la labor del Comit\u00e9 tendr\u00e1 mayor importancia en el futuro, porque siendo el foro que inici\u00f3 y desarroll\u00f3 el Plan de Acci\u00f3n estrechamente asociado en la mente de los gobiernos y de la comunidad internacional con \u00e9l. Adem\u00e1s, a medida que se fomentan los programas en el marco del Plan de Acci\u00f3n, su funci\u00f3n asesora ser\u00e1 cada vez mas valiosa. Por estos motivos el Consejo puede considerar conveniente aumentar los l\u00edmites m\u00ednimo y m\u00e1ximo de miembros del Comit\u00e9 de la cifra actual 15/45, a un n\u00famero que no sea inferior a 30 ni superior a 60. De apoyar la propuesta de aumentar los miembros del Comit\u00e9 podr\u00edase aprobar la Resoluci\u00f3n que podr\u00eda seguir los lineamientos del proyecto que figura como ap\u00e9ndice del documento en discusi\u00f3n.

I am pleased to convey the support of my delegation to the Ms. Anne-Lise the number of members in the Committee on Forest Development in the Trop ics, and we therefore fully support the adoption of the proposed draft resolution along the lines in Appendix of Doc. CL 90/3, Rev. 1. Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, since we attach great importance to tropical forestry in rural development in the developing countries, we would like to see a Committee. 1 / 1/ Statement inserted the verbatim records on request. -490- John R. GOLDSACK (United Kingdom): The United Kingdom endorses the view expressed in the paper (paragraph 24) that the work of the Committee on Forest Development in the Tropics (CFDT) is even more important in relation to the TFAP now and in future. We recognise that increased membership the CFDT to tropical qualified and experienced professional opinion in the meetings of the Committee. We governments preferably to taking due of the context of the proposed agenda. To ensure selection of the most appropriate professional participants, we would emphasize the need for the proposed dates and agenda for CFDT meetings to be circulated well in advance. 1 / 16.3 Amendments to the Agreement for the Establishment of a Regional Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia, the Far East and the South-West Pacific : 16.3 Modifications de l'Accord portant cr\u00e9ation d'une Commission r\u00e9gionale de et sant\u00e9 animales pour l'Asie, l'Extr\u00eame-Orient et le Pacifique Sud-Ouest : 16.3 Enmiendas al Acuerdo para la creaci\u00f3n de una Comisi\u00f3n Regional de Producci\u00f3n y Sanidad Pecuarias para Asia, el Lejano Oriente y el Sudoeste del Pac\u00edfico: LEGAL COUNSEL: With regard to document CL 90/14 which you have before you, you will see that there are some amendments proposed for approval by the Council to the Agreement for the Establishment of a Regional Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia, the Far East and the South-West Pacific. These amendments were approved by the Commission itself at its last meeting held in Bangkok and they are reproduced on page 4 of the English text of the document, that is, in the Appendix. As you will see the amendments are purely questions of form and they bring the current nomenclature into line with those approved by Conference for the Regional Office and the Region itself, which is now Asia and the Pacific. The words \"the Far East\" and \"South-West\" have been dropped. This is before you for approval, if the resolution which is in paragraph 7 of the document and to which the actual amendments would be annexed is agreeable to the Council, then those amendments will enter into force immediately. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie Monsieur Roche pour son expos\u00e9 Nous les d\u00e9bats. Il y a-t-il des qui veuillent intervenir sur point? Bien. Nous consid\u00e9rons le projet de r\u00e9solution pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans ce document, au point 7, et les amendements indiqu\u00e9s par QADIR (Pakistan): I would like to ask the Secretariat to enlighten me as to the definition of tropical forestry. I should also like information about the selection criteria membership of the Committee. LE PRESIDENT: Je m'excuse, le point 16. 2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9.

I missed the fact that this item has been closed for debate. I should like to raise these two questions with the Secretariat in order to try and find out the selection criteria for membership. There is a problem which I would like to be enlightened upon. Iran and Iraq are members of the Committee but they are not shown as belonging to the tropical region, whereas Pakistan is shown in the tropical region and is not a member. However, I will pursue this matter with the Secretariat. LE PRESIDENT: Je suis qu'il remercions Monsieur Roche. 16.4 Abolition of the Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East 16.4 Suppression de la Commission r\u00e9gionale sur la gestion des exploitations en Asie et en Extr\u00eame- Orient 16.4 Abolici\u00f3n de la Comisi\u00f3n Regional de Administraci\u00f3n Rural para Asia y el Lejano Oriente C. H. BONTE-FRIEDHEIM (Assistant Director-General, Agriculture Department): The FAO Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East was first established by the Director-General as a Working Party, on the recommendation of the Regional Conference for Asia and the Far East in its Fourth Session (1958). It was approved by the FAO Conference at its Tenth Session (1959) and renamed \"Regional Commission\" by the Council at its Forty-seventh Session (1966), in accordance with the nomenclature used in Article VI-I of the Basic Texts . The purpose of the Commission is to stimulate and coordinate farm management and extension activities and to facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the Member Nations of the Region. The Commission has attempted to attain these objectives by conducting the following activities: (i) Commission Sessions (ii) Technical Meetings (iii) Exchange of Information (iv) Country and Regional Studies (v) Development of Farm Management Techniques Commission Sessions The Commission, and its predecessor, has met nine times since its first session in 1961. The last sessi on was held in October this year in Malaysia. The number of participating countries has varied between four countries participated. The low attendance stems largely fr om the fact that budgetary resources for the Commission are insufficient for good preparatory work, or for funding the participation of experts to give keynote addresses. The Commission Sessions provide a forum for the exchange of experience among participating countries. Delegates present papers which discuss the status, problems and future development of farm management and related programmes in their respective countries. -492- The future of the Commission has been discussed twice before by the Council, first at its Eighty-Second Session in November 1982, and then again at the Eighty-Sixth Session in November 1984. On each occasion, the Council decided that the abolition of the Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East should be deferred until the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific could examine the matter. The seventeenth Regional Conference in 1984 requested that FAO should revita lise the Commission and, at the same time, member countries were urged to participate in the Commission's work. The Eighteenth Regional Conference was informed that action was being taken to revitalise the Commission and noted that the regional technical commissions were active. It did not specifically consider the Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East since the meeting of the Commission was planned for October this year after the Regional Conference had met. Therefore, this Council does not have a specific report from the Eighteenth Regional Conference as requested in accordance with paragraph 215 of the Report of the Eighty-Sixth Council which reads: \"The Council unanimously agreed to defer any decision regarding the abolition of the Commission on Farm Management until it had r eceived a report from the Eighteenth Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific on the performance of the Commission in the intervening period. \" Following the last Regional Conference, the Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East has met once more. The major results of this Ninth Session of the Commission can be summarised as follows. The Commission endorsed farming systems development as a basic approach to integrated agricultural development. It strongly supported the need for the establishment of a coordinating mechanism for farming systems development, action to determine specific information and data requirements for its development, and the designation of a focal point in each country to deal with the technical aspects of farming systems. The outcome of this last session of the Commission will be reported to and discussed by the Nineteenth Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific in 1988. It is therefore recommended that the Council consider delaying a decision on the future of the Commission once more un til November 1988 in order to await the results of the discussions at the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific. Mohd. Mazlan BIN JUSOH (Malaysia): Even though to be deferred, my delegation would like to say a few words about the Commission since we were the host to the last Session of this Commission. But first I should like to thank Mr. Bonte-Friedheim for his very comprehensive introduction. The Ninth Session of the FAO Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East was held in Kuala Lumpur from 28 to 31 October 1983. We think it was a major su ccess. This can allay the general concern by FAO and member countries about its continued existence since the Eighth member their representatives during the Ninth Session. Three Reports on farm management activities in the region and three working papers from FAO's Secretariat in Bangkok, seven country reports and four supporting technical papers from Malaysia were presented and deliberated on. I will not dwell on the various important recommendations made by the Commission at this Session since this has been adequately covered by Mr. Bonte-Friedheim. Suffice it to say that they are fundamental to the development of farming systems aimed at optimising income at the household level. -493- We pleased to note the renewed interest of member countries of the region in the said meeting. In our assessment, the Commission still has a very vital role to play in upgrading the productive capacities of member countries, particularly in the development of farming systems suited the needs of small farmers in the regions. Therefore, we feel that the Commission should continue its although we agree that the decision to abolish or not to abolish the Commission, should be left to the the Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific in 1988. E. Wayne DENNEY (United States of America): The United States certainly concurs that no action regarding the Commission is warranted at this time. We have been fully involved in all of the negotiations and discussions since the Committee on Food Security was first established in 1982. At the meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan, in 1984 we were persuasively convinced that the Asian countries were going to do their best to re-vitalise the Commission, and there is strong evidence that such has been the case. The meeting is certainly not costing a great deal of money, and although we encourage the abolition of organizations that are not performing a viable role, there is, in our mind, strong evidence that every effort is being made to make a Commission viable that was once inactive and has the potential for being very useful. . Koo-Bum SHIN (Observer for Korea, Republic of): First of all, I should like to express our sincere appreciation of the presentation made by Mr. Bonte-Friedheim. It has been more than four years now without any conclusion to this matter since the Director-General proposed to this Council the abolition of the Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East. My delegation does think that this is a demonstration of how deeply and how considerably this Council has been dealing with this question. My country, where the average farm household land is very small in size, attaches great importance to the advice and recommendations which can come from this kind of advisory body. In this sense, my delegation would like to accept the Council's decision on this question as stated in paragraph 5 of the document. There is one other trivial thing: In paragraph 4 there is a list of countries, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and so on. In this case Korea is indicated and this is O. K. M. Afzal QADIR (Pakistan): To do otherwise than has been paragraph 5 of this document would be inappropriate in the light of the fact that until we have r eceived the Report of the Regional Co mmission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East for us to take any action other than what has been recommended in this paper would be discourteous. Having said this, I should like to endorse the point of view expressed by the delegate of Malaysia. Our experience of this Commission is similar to that of Malaysia. I would also like to endorse the statement representative of the United States. Pinit KORSIEPORN (Thailand): The FAO Regional Commission for Farm Management for Asia and the Far East has provided a channel for exchange of knowledge, experiences and studies to eliminate problems on farm countries. The Commission also extends its activities to farm management matters such as data collection, analysis, seminars. My delegation recognises importance farm management as a tool to improve the livelihood of the farming population. As with farm established of Agriculture and Cooperatives. Therefore, my delegation fully supports the continued existence of the Regional Commission on Farm Management for Asia and the Far East. However, we are of the opinion that policy and performance could be reviewed and revised from time to time according that an Expert Consultation on the revitilisation of the Commission was held in July this year, followed by the convening of the Ninth Session of the Commission in October, but so far we have not been informed in detail of the outcome of of the Consultation are to be forwarded to the next meeting of the FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific in 1988, we Council members should be informed at an early stage of the contents of the discussions of the last Session of the Commission in a report form so as to deepen the Council members' understanding of this matter. We sincerely hope that the final recommendation will be made at the next Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific which will be held in 1988. C. H. BONTE-FRIEDHEIM (Assistant Director-General, Agriculture Department): I thank the Council have spoken in support, because FAO also think that it is a very important regional commission. We have noted the specific request from the delegate of Japan that Council would like to have a copy of the report of the last session of the Commission in October, this year. We will ensure that the report will be available to Council Members after the next regional conference.

Alberto Jacoviello et Carlo Alberto Pinelli, pour la presse de Retenu pu venir Il repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 della Rovere du Bureau du \"Corriere della Sera\" \u00e0 Rome, \u00e0 qui je demande vouloir du podium, -Soyez notre interm\u00e9diaire t\u00e9moin probl\u00e8mes que affronter les pays du tiers monde. M. DELLA ROVERE originale italienne): Je vous remercie de ce prix; c'est un honneur pour notre journal et \u00e9galement un plaisir parce que nous savons que le probl\u00e8me de la faim dans le monde est un des probl\u00e8mes fondamentaux, un le et un producteur). Ils ont su marier avec \u00e9mu car ce prix un qui optimisme pays en d\u00e9veloppement et en particulier aux pays du Sahel. Ces pays pas qui collabore \u00e0 l'Avvenire et de M. Ettore Mo, du Corriere della Sera. A tous, je renouvelle mes plus vives f\u00e9licitations. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I thank you. I wanted to join the Director-General in congratulating my countrymen, winners of this prize and congratulating once again the FAO for starting this prize which is going to be an annual affair. I feel forty years younger at this moment because forty years ago I abandoned journalism to start this new arduous task and I think that diplomats around the world like me today feel, as the Director-General rightly pointed out, indebted to the efforts of our mass media for all that they have done in the last few years to radically change the attitude of the Italian public opinion and public opinion for a democratic country means parliament. In the course of the last five years I have had two ambassadorships in developing c\u00f3untries-or almost developing countries; India is not a developing country, it is far ahead. While in this position I understood how much help I received from the government because parliament had passed the laws appropriating more and more funds for aid development. Now, is not the occasion to say how drastically our laws have changed and they are going to change again because we are going to pass a new legislation, but this effort of the Italian press and the Italian radio, television and movies, la presse \u00e9crite , the written press and the audio-visual press, if you call it that, has been of tremendous help to us. I want to join in thanking both Mr. Sormani, in his absence through Mr. Della Rovere, Mr. Jacoviello, who is in Moscow, another souvenir of my career; and Mr. Pinelli who is, happily, with us, for their efforts, their very commendable efforts. We wish to have more and more such occasions in the future. We are proud that the Italian journalists have done a very good job for the FAO because we have the firm conviction that by mobilizing public opinion we will be able to do more and more through the ordinary means and the extraordinary means to help this wonderful organization. -498- Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom language Arabic): Mr. Chairman, dear members, in fact we have not been able to hide our pleasure, our happiness and our satisfaction for this beautiful step taken by our pioneer organization, under the leadership of its Director-General. This wonderful step which consisted in providing those journalists who have shared our problems with us concerning agricultural development and food production with awards. In fact these journalists, through their articles, have expressed their own feelings, their own sentiments. We congratulate them wholeheartedly for this wonderful significant work they have carried out and we thank the FAO for this marvellous step.

El proyecto de Informe que preparamos recoge los aspectos fundamentales y transcendentes de nuestros debates en Plenaria, as\u00ed por los menos lo creemos los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Todos en el Comit\u00e9 estuvimos conscientes de que no era deseable ni conveniente que en tal proyecto se expresen los detalles de las distintas intervenciones. Esos detalles se presentan con toda precisi\u00f3n en los respectivos verbatims . Lo que se busc\u00f3, se\u00f1or Presidente, fue plasmar los aspectos donde hubo consenso, as\u00ed como precisar los casos en los que no lo hubo, es decir, las divergencias de opiniones y de posiciones. En nuestros trabajos se reconoci\u00f3 el derecho de cada qui\u00e9n a disentir y expresar su propria opini\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n que cada Estado Miembro debe ser tratado igual que cualquier otro y, por tanto, que no exist\u00edan prerrogativas o tratos preferenciales para nadie. S\u00f3lo en aquellos casos en que se consider\u00f3 indispensable se hizo referencia nominal a uno o varios pa\u00edses. En la elaboraci\u00f3n del proyecto de informe se tuvieron a la mano como referencia los verbatims y tambi\u00e9n nos guiamos por las directrices y las decisiones tomadas por usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, as\u00ed como por la s\u00edntesis que usted tuvo a bien presentar a la consideraci\u00f3n del Consejo al t\u00e9rmino del tratamiento de cada tema. Llamo la atenci\u00f3n de este Consejo a trav\u00e9s de usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, sobre el hecho de que el proyecto de informe no contiene, no contiene reservas de ning\u00fan tipo y que ning\u00fan p\u00e1rrafo se ha presentado en corchetes. Asimismo subrayo que en el seno del Comit\u00e9 se elogi\u00f3 en general la forma en que los textos hab\u00edan sido preparados por la Secretaria de la FAO. Al respecto, tuvimos siempre la asistencia de los funcionarios de la Secretaria encargados de los distintos temas y que nos ayudaron a solventar dudas y aclarar interpretaciones. Se reconoci\u00f3 asimismo que la forma en que la representaci\u00f3n regional estuvo integrada en nuestro Comit\u00e9 permiti\u00f3 recoger de la manera m\u00e1s adecuada posible las distintas interpretaciones y declaraciones\u00b7 Se\u00f1or Presidente, el proyecto de informe representa un balance muy delicado que le cost\u00f3 al Comit\u00e9 un gran esfuerzo de buena voluntad, de concreci\u00f3n de ideas y tambi\u00e9n de horas de trabajo. S\u00f3lo como an\u00e9cdota deseo informarles que estuvimos reunidos un total de casi 35 horas a lo largo de seis d\u00edas de intensas labores. Pongo, pues, se\u00f1or Presidente, a su consideraci\u00f3n y a trav\u00e9s de usted a este Consejo el proyecto de informe que consta, como usted bien lo ha aclarado, de nueve partes y que la raz\u00f3n que obedece que se presenten de esta manera, como usted tambi\u00e9n lo ha explicado, es de tipo mec\u00e1nico. Reconozco que hay peque\u00f1os errores mecanogr\u00e1fieos y quiz\u00e1 algunas otras cuestiones que se filtraron indebidamente, sea de traducci\u00f3n, de homogeneidad de t\u00e9rminos o de tipo mecanogr\u00e1fico. Le propongo, se\u00f1or Presidente, con todo respeto, y si lo tiene a bien, que les pida a los distinguidos miembros de nuestro Consejo que tales cuestiones menores sean llevadas directamente a la Secretaria a fin de evitar interrumpir la deliberaci\u00f3n sobre los asuntos de mayor envergadura. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction \u00e9claircissements. -501- DRAFT REPORT-PART I PROJET I 1 approved Le pararaphe 1 est approuv\u00e9 p\u00e1rrafo 1 es aprobado Paragraph 2 approved Le paragraphe 2 est approuv\u00e9 El p\u00e1rrafo 2 es aprobado Paragraphs 3 and 4 approved Les paragraphes 3 et 4 sont approuv\u00e9s Los p\u00e1rrafos 3 y 4 son aprobados Paragraphs 5 to 7 approved Les paragraphes 5 \u00e0 7 sont approuv\u00e9s Los p\u00e1rrafos 5 a 7 son aprobados PARAGRAPHS 8 to 21 PARAGRAPHES 8 \u00e0 21 9. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I have just one query. I notice there is a reference to \"flows of both concessional and non-concessional capital had been set back. \" Is this a reference to GIP concessional capital and non-concessional capital generally, rather \u00bfhan in the agricultural sector? If so, is this correct that there were figures provided? I ask this in ignorance. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): S\u00ed, efectivamente se refiere a corrientes en general y no solamente relativas a la agricultura, tal como se expresaba en el documento de referencia, no recuerdo el p\u00e1rrafo correspondiente; no tengo tampoco a la mano las cifras que se pudieran haber menionado en el documento CL 90/2. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I was on paragraph 10, but I thought a expert would ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): S\u00ed senor Presidente. Por el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n se debati\u00f3 sobre esta cuesti\u00f3n y se coincidi\u00f3 en que el sentido general, por lo menos de la mayor parte de los miembros, era el que se hab\u00eda lamentado que aumentaban, aumentaban las medidas de tipo proteccionista, no que se hubieran mantenido, de manera que la expresi\u00f3n que se ha usado aqu\u00ed responde, y as\u00ed lo estim\u00f3 el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, a ese sentimiento general que se percibi\u00f3 en nuestro Consejo. -502- LE PETTITT (United Kingdom): I would have to have a minor reservation on this because I do not think there is statistical evidence that there is \"widespread proliferation\" if that means widespread increasing growth of I would suggest would probably of\". Would this not be Council\u00b7 Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Nostros vamos a estar de acuerdo con que esto se mantenga, o por lo menos se diga el \"Incremento\", porque, la verdad, no es el mantenimiento del prot eccionismo, el proteccionismo agr\u00edcola sobre todo ha sufrido incremento que sufrimos los pa\u00edses que tenemos algo que exportar y que estamos sometidos a impuestos de importaci\u00f3n en los pa\u00edses que son nuestros destinatarios, y por esa raz\u00f3n vamos a mantener el t\u00e9rmino \"proliferaci\u00f3n\" porque en este \u00faltimo a\u00f1o \u00e9sa ha sido la realidad. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Para aclarar por qu\u00e9 se us\u00f3 el t\u00e9rmino, porque no solamente se refiere al incremento de medidas que ya se han tomado, sino la toma de nuevas medidas, de nuevas medidas que se aprecian en el \u00e1mbito general. No solamente es un problema cuantitativo, sino cualitativo el que se est\u00e1 reflejando aqu\u00ed en este p\u00e1rrafo. Solamente quiero hacer esa aclaraci\u00f3n. LE Rep. of): I see that in paragraph 11, as the then President of the Drafting Committee put it, he has made use of his right to express his own opinion and so we should say \"Some of the the European acts protectionism\" or to avoid mentioning one developed Community. Those are the possibilities we have. LE PRESIDENT: Le texte fran\u00e7ais ne parle pas de la Communaut\u00e9 suggest deleting two words in the third line of the paragraph of the English text, to delete the words \"to try\" so that the be struck out because in the French text we do not have it, I do not know why we should have it in the English text. LE PRESIDENT: Je constate une diff\u00e9rence entre le texte fran\u00e7ais et le texte anglais. Le fran\u00e7ais ne mentionne la alors texte anglais la ce point particulier, je donne la parole \u00e0 M. le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. -503- Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Efectivamente, es un error de la version francesa, se lo subrayo, un error de la version francesa. En espa\u00f1ol dice \"algunos miembros pidieron a la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea y a los dem\u00e1s pa\u00edses desarrollados que practican el proteccionismo\"; no se est\u00e1 indicando aqu\u00ed ni a la totalidad de los pa\u00edses desarrollados ni tampoco se est\u00e1 excluyendo a ciertos pa\u00edses de esta cuesti\u00f3n. Lo que les quiero hacer ver es que este p\u00e1rrafo sufri\u00f3 intensos debates de horas en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, inclusive el Comit\u00e9 estim\u00f3 pertinente que el distinguido representa nte de la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea pudiera expresar su opini\u00f3n al respecto. Esta fue escuchada y el p\u00e1rrafo obedece, en consecuencia, a un delicado equ ilibrio que responde tambi\u00e9n al del resto de los p\u00e1rrafos que usteded ven en esa secci\u00f3n. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom); Now I know that the English rather than the French text is the correct one. I come forward to suggest that we do o mit a specific reference to a group of countries; the proposal that one changes this to read \"those countries which practise protectionism\" would be appropriate. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia propone que, aunque se sabe que estamos en un momento en que no conviene plantear cuestiones distintas a las conclusiones del informe, tal vez, justamente como estamos empezando, convendr\u00eda recordar que en la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional del Trabajo se ha consagrado el principio de la divisi\u00f3n de labores. Digo esto porque el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n est\u00e1 integrado por palees y no por personas. La Sra. Fritelli, en nombre de Italia, acept\u00f3 este p\u00e1rrafo all\u00e1 en Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y luego no es precedente que aqu\u00ed, el Embajador de Italia se oponga a este texto; esto es para el futuro, Sr. Presidente. Como lo ha dicho el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, este texto cost\u00f3 largas horas de discusiones y luego lo arreglamos muy satisfactoriamente con las delegaciones de Francia, Italia y con el Sr. Rateau, representante de la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea. La redacci\u00f3n flexible a la cual se refiri\u00f3 Yugoslavia fue parte del arreglo. Por lo tanto, muy cordialemente quisiera pedirle al colega de. Yugoslavia y a todos los dem\u00e1s Miembros del Consejo que nos permitan adoptar este p\u00e1rrafo tal como fue aprobado, porque tambi\u00e9n todos sabemos que en la Comunidad el Reino Unido es parte integrante y algo m\u00e1s, preside todav\u00eda el Consejo de la Comunidad; luego todos est\u00e1n comprometidos en este texto a trav\u00e9s de la participaci\u00f3n del Consejo de esa Comunidad\u00b7 Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): La delegaci\u00f3n de Venezuela se va a manifestar de acuerdo con la redacci\u00f3n que trae el p\u00e1rrafo del informe en el texto espa\u00f1ol que dice: \"Algunos miembros pidieron a la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea...\" tal como lo ha dicho nuestro Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y es que lo cierto es que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, sobre to do 1985-86, nuestros pa\u00edses en desarrollo de Am\u00e9rica Latina-estoy hablando por los pa\u00edses de America Latina especialmente-sufren estas consecuencias del proteccionismo y de las barreras aqu\u00ed en los pa\u00edses europeos por una serie de excusas: porque no cumplen tales requisitos de tales condiciones de sanidad, etc. ; son excusas, pero lo cierto es que los productos de Am\u00e9rica Latina, que anteriormente ven\u00edan a Europa y que constitu\u00edan parte de nuestra exportaci\u00f3n-en este caso hablo por Venezuela-hoy\u00b0se encuentran pr\u00e1cticamente vedados de entrar al continente europeo porque la Comunidad Econ\u00f3mica Europea establece sus barreras, si se las pone incluso a otros miembros, como en el caso de los del Sur, por ejemplo, en general, incluso los otros pa\u00edses que est\u00e1n creando barreras; se han intentado crearnos barreras, incluso con la exportaci\u00f3n petrolira y ya la tenemos con el hierro, est\u00e1n impuestos crecidos para la exportaci\u00f3n de hierro y para la exportaci\u00f3n de petr\u00f3leo, a pesar de que son insumos que necesitan sus industrias, pero le ponen obst\u00e1culos en forma de impuestos de importaci\u00f3n. Por eso, mantenemos nuestro apoyo al p\u00e1rrafo tal como est\u00e1 porque son desarrollos de la ultima etapa de este tiempo. LE PRESIDENT: J'aimerais que, dans toute la mesure du possible, ne de fond. Il de et, paragraph 11, \"a certain number of members\"-and I wish members-\"asked those countries which practised protectionism, subsidies and other affecting trade to eliminate those barriers\". I would like to join with the Yugoslav suggestion, leave out the \"to try to\". Let us get to work in the the GATT with all these protectionist measures that are hindering the free trade of the world. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I think that is a good proposal to say that all countries, all members asked those countries. I could follow the United States proposal. Jacques POSIER (France): La pr\u00e9sence de la France, de avons d\u00fb noter le ce d\u00e9bat. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos primeramente reconocer al Presidente y al Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n la presentaci\u00f3n de este documento que, como lo dijera el Presidente, se ve que es un documento bien trabajado. Sobre el tema que nos ocupa, queremos decir que hay aqu\u00ed dos realidades, que no aceptarlas seria contraproducente en la discusi\u00f3n de hoy. Una real, que se puede contar, que se puede tocar, que la podemos expresar otra vez. Algunos miembros expresaron eso; eso es una realidad. Segunda realidad, que no creo que tampoco se pueda evitar; no se puede evitar porque las discusiones que han habido no s\u00f3lo aqu\u00ed sino-nosotros no estamos aislados del mundo-las ha habido en los foros econ\u00f3micos. El proteccionismo existe como instrumento y como mecanismo real, y lo estamos discutiendo, inclusive sus condiciones. No podemos pretender evitar que se diga que \"algunos miembros piden a la CEE y a los dem\u00e1s pa\u00edses desarrollados... que traten de eliminar...\"; piense que en eso el Consejo fue bastante...\", \"...que traten de eliminar... \", porque sabemos que nos es f\u00e1cil dentro de los mecanismos econ\u00f3micos de estos pa\u00edses eliminar eso. Ahora, si algunos se consideran que no est\u00e1n incluidos ah\u00ed, bueno, espec\u00edficamente el que se crea que no est\u00e1 incluido ah\u00ed, que lo exprese, pero como nunca lo hemos discutido aqu\u00ed con nombres y apellidos sino generalizando, esta es la forma mejor de generalizar el Consejo; ahora, si hay un pa\u00eds que considera que \u00e9l no debe estar ah\u00ed, que lo exprese y lo discutimos aqu\u00ed, pero no vemos otra salida. LE PRESIDENT: Personnellement, \u00e9t\u00e9 assez impressionn\u00e9 par la France, savoir qu'il ne pas des du Conseil Conseil et d'une r\u00e9ponse de la CEE, de sorte que cela n'engage pas le Conseil dans \u00e1 totalit\u00e9 mala refl\u00e8te un \u00e9change, c'est-\u00e0-dire une demande et une r\u00e9ponse. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I do not want to prolong this discussion. We have not had the opportunity to give our thanks to the Drafting Committee. I feel they did a wonderful job, that it was rather difficult to unite all that was brought up in this Session. I find the proposal of the United States certainly a little bit practical to overcome the difficulties we have. Our French colleague is right when he said it was not all of the Council who expressed, but the thoughts behind us were such. But maybe I can come back to my first proposal. Could we not say \"which in their opinion practised protectionism\"? That would of Drafting to whom our thanks are due. Basically it reflected the sense of the pro ceedings and I think this should remain. Perhaps at best one could remove the word \"certain\", and paragraphs 11 and 12 read together reflect the whole position. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): We are not a Member of the Drafting Committee but on reading this paragraph we think that the Drafting Committee made a very big effort on this and we hail this effort. I think this effort of compromise is apparent from of paragraph, that there was a question and a reply. So if we change the start of the paragraph the rest of the paragraph will fall. So my delegation, which feels very strongly about protectionism, is very ready to a ccept this paragraph as it is. If we open up the discussion we will not find an end. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): Just in the spirit of compromise, I would accept the appeal by the delegate of Colombia not to insist on my proposal to delete the two words \"to try\". I want to satisfy him and the efforts of the Drafting Committee. But as this is a statement of one side, I do not think we should be so polite as to use words which would correspond to the other side. So I do not insist. But in my future interventions I would take care not to give up when I think that things should be in. LE PRESIDENT: Si j'al bien compris, le paragraphe 11 refl\u00e8te une et par d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la France sur ce point est tr\u00e8s pertinente. Une suggestion a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite Conseil Kingdom): I query the sentence in the middle \u00f2 f paragraph 12: \"The Council urged that FAO be involved in these negotiations...\" I think summing up strong this. I think it would be more in accord with the mood if FAO contribute to these negotiapions. This is not a subject that I am well briefed on. But I did not read this from your summary in CL 90/PV/4, page 37. R. MacINTOSH (Canada): Just to say that we would agree, that we believe that \"contribute to\" would Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9dation et \u00e0 tous les de ce \"L'Accord le bl\u00e9 certains Membres.... \", je crois qu'il faudrait dire mots un peu plus forts car je pense qu'aucun pays Republic of): I juat wanted to support the British proposal. Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Respecto de la enmienda sugerida por el Reino Unido y ahora apoyada por la delegaci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Alemania, les quiero decir que esa oraci\u00f3n no sufri\u00f3 modificaciones durante el Comit\u00e9, si bien se reconoci\u00f3 que era la forma o que rescataba la forma en que usted habla resumido nuestros debates. En relaci\u00f3n con la segunda cuesti\u00f3n, \u00e9sta fue planteada en el Comit\u00e9 y se incluy\u00f3 en la forma en que ustedes la ven. Claro que esto nos signific\u00f3 hacer un recuento de los delegados que apoyaban esta decisi\u00f3n de cl\u00e1usulas econ\u00f3micas, aunque por lo que veo, el distinguido delegado del Congo siente, y quiz\u00e1 tenga raz\u00f3n, de que se trat\u00f3 de muchos o por lo menos asi lo podr\u00edamos interpretar. Es algo que el Consejo debe determinar. LE PRESIDENT: Il y a deux points en discussion. Le premier concerne la phrase a le terme \"instamment\". Si je ne me trompe pas, le mot \"contribue\" est admis par les d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s du Canada et du Royaume-Uni. Le deuxi\u00e8me point est international Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): My proposal would be only in the first line, to delete the word \"important\", because the word \"important\" as it is put here gives an implication of a big positive role, while in fact in discussions there were some delegations which were of the opinion that transnational corporations are not deeply involved in agriculture, especially not in food, which is important. On the other side, I think it would be better just to delete the word and just to say that the Council noted the role that transnational corporations played in agriculture, and so on. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros realmente queremos coincidir con la exposici\u00f3n que ha hecho el representante de Yugoslavia. Nos parece que la primera parte de este p\u00e1rrafo es un poco contradictoria. Se dice: el Consejo observa, el Consejo observa en su totalidad. Despu\u00e9s dice: algunos miembros expresan. Una opini\u00f3n que afecta negativamente a los intereses. Y se dice: el Consejo observ\u00f3 la importante funci\u00f3n. Yo creo que la palabra \"importante\" est\u00e1 dem\u00e1s ah\u00ed. Si lo dejamos en: el Consejo observ\u00f3 la funci\u00f3n que desempe\u00f1aban las empresas. Independientemente de que tenemos criterio estamos pidiendo un estudio que se va a hacer en \u00e9l. Ya sabremos qu\u00e9 grado de importancia tiene. Por el momento creo que no debemos calificarla de importante. Eso es todo. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I do not wish to be egotistical, but we did discuss transnationals at some length. I think that they can be very important. I have been in African countries where secretaries of the Treasury have said: \"How do we get some investments, we must develop our agriculture-how do you do it?\" The Quakers in one country in Central America started a food processing plant which was then developed into a very good on-going transnational with lnvestment to increase the development. 1 went some length Into this, and I see no mention of it. Maybe I should not insist that everything I say be recorded. But lawyers can be trained to protect their country's interests and this will make it possible for the Secretary of the Treasury of those countries who wish to have investments connected with agriculture, it can indeed be connected with agriculture. We heard just yesterday about the problems when some countries are producing agricultural produce which is hard to transport and store and keep. If they can be processed they are highly valuable to the agricultural world and to the agricultural field. The processing plants, the investing companies, and the transnationals are are properly guarded by trained lawyers. I see nothing of that here. I do not think we can endorse every transnational, but under certain conditions they are very desirable. And it think the main issue in this paragraph is to ask FAO to complete the study being made on TNC and agriculture. The first sentence unfortunately conveys a very effects, whereas the main issue is to complete the study of the TNC's. I was not personally in the Drafting Committee but I go along with both sentences. I would say that \"the Council noted the role that transnational corporations could play in the of put it \"could countries\" because, that is reality as we perceive it in the developing countries. They can play a role but they have not always played that role. Perhaps it might be better, subject to the comments of the Council and the distinguished Chairman of the Drafting Committee, to eliminate the first two sentences. intervenir sur ce point pr\u00e9cis? Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Efectivamente este p\u00e1rrafo recibi\u00f3 cierta discusi\u00f3n en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, particularmente con la delegaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos que modul\u00f3 el p\u00e1rrafo de manera que se dijera que fueron s\u00f3lo algunos miembros los que expresaron que pod\u00eda afectar negativamente los Intereses de los pa\u00edses. Esta expresi\u00f3n ven\u00eda de alguna manera a contrabalancear lo que se dec\u00eda, como bien ha dicho el delegado de la India, en la primera oraci\u00f3n. Se introdujo, pues, el t\u00e9rmino en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n: de que algunos miembros hab\u00edan expresado tal opini\u00f3n, aunque debo advertir, se\u00f1or Presidente, que efectivamente no se desarrollaron debates extensos, cuando menos, en este tema, no se hizo y tampoco se refiri\u00f3 a lo que ha declarado la distinguida delegada de Estados Unidos. No se refiri\u00f3 en este tema a esta cuesti\u00f3n. Aqu\u00ed lo importante, como ha destacado el delegado de la India, era la recomendaci\u00f3n a la FAO de que presentara tal estudio, y no tanto un debate sobre si eran buenas o malas o ten\u00edan defectos negativos o positivos. LE PRESIDENT: Effectivement les phrases 1 et 2 du paragraphe 13, ainsi que l'a le proposition pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e important qu'ils accomplissent. Concernant le ce paragraphe, on parle du FIDA et notamment utile \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension de la phrase. Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Dem. Republic of) (Original language Arabic): At the outset I should like to support what has been said by the delegation of Tunisia. However, my observation covers the whole of paragraph 14. I should like this paragraph to be re-written so that it would read as follows: \"While the Council has reviewed, (or noted) with satisfaction that the second replenishment of the resources became effective as of November, it expressed its regret at the low level of contributions and it called upon the international community to support efforts that were being made\". I should like to stress what has been said by the delegate of Tunisia \"in order to secure or to guarantee a stable and secure financial basis. \" I think this would make the paragraph PRESIDENT: au de bien nous lire \u00e0 nouveau ce paragraphe car nous sommes en face du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction, et qu'il nous informe de la r\u00e9daction qu'il envisage ce dernier paragraphe\u00b7 -508- Anwar Mohammed KHALED (Yemen, People's Dem. Republic of) (Original language Arabic): In order to make the matter clearer and in view of the fact that all of us speak English, I shall try to give it in English. Continued in English: \"While the Council noted with satisfaction that second of IFAD became effective on 27th November, it regretted the low level of contributions and called...\", and then the rest of the sentence, but after \"called on the international community to support efforts that were being made in order for\" I suggest \"in order to ensure for IFAD a secure and stable financial basis\". LE PRESIDENT: C'est clair. Je pense que le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction a pris note de cette suggestion que nous Arabia, Kingdom of): First, I should like to thank my friend, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, Ambassador Jos\u00e9, for his efforts to give us this nice, clear report. I can see the tiredness on his face and on the faces of the other members of the Drafting Committee. As a member of the Executive Board of IFAD, and as a member of the Audit Committee IFAD, of paragraph 14 gave me the impression, and I believe everybody here, that IFAD has collapsed-Kaput -which I believe does not reflect the real picture for IFAD. Yes, there are problems, there is no doubt about that, everybody knows about it. However, IFAD is still going on and it will continue to do so for ever. I believe all countries category 1, 2 and 3 are doing their best to keep IFAD for the benefit of the poor countries and poor farmers. IFAD is doing well, it is fine, and all of us really are satisfied. I should like to modify this sentence. I do not want to make it too complicated but if my colleagues here accept this, to take out \"the Council part of this\", I should like to suggest we keep \"while the second replenishment of IFAD was welcomed\"-it is really welcomed and has been effected, then we can take out this sentence: \"The Council regretted that it failed to attain its target level. \" That we should take out. We have to take it out. We can then go directly on and say \"and called on the international community to support efforts that were being made in order for IFAD to continue\", not to \"survive\" but to \"continue on a stable basis\". I believe this way we could present a clear picture. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): When I asked for the floor I also had in mind the end of the sentence. It is not really the best expression \"to survive on a stable basis\". That does not really give the message of what we need from IFAD. I thought that this should be corrected. I had some idea that both proposals from the distinguished representatives from the Yemen and Saudi Arabia cover my concern. I would like to read it if it will help the draft, that I propose. I would only change the last line after the words \"in order\". The text would IFAD to continue to play its useful role on a secure and stable financial basis. \" This is my proposal, which is very similar to the other two, but if it helps I would not insist on the wording. I the implication of survival. Millicent M. (United of America): I would like to associate my delegation with the views of the delegate from the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and of Yugoslavia which have been expressed. LE PRESIDENT: Il semble qu'il y ait propos\u00e9e -509- Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Yo podr\u00eda leer lo que acaba de declarar la delegaci\u00f3n de Yugoslavia. Si me lo permite, se\u00f1or Presidente, lo har\u00e9 en ingl\u00e9s. Contin\u00faa en ingl\u00e9s: \"While the Council noted with satisfaction that the second replenishment of IFAD became effective on 27 November 1986, it regretted the lower level of contributions and called on the international community to support efforts that were being made in order to ensure for IFAD a secure and stable financial basis\"\u00b7 Continued in Spanish: Eso es lo que yo hab\u00eda anotado; pero si hay alguna correcci\u00f3n, ya que se hicieron varias propuestas, espero que lo digan. LE PRESIDENT: \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 internationale pour pense que l'on pourrait ainsi un peu \"regonfler\" et la communaut\u00e9 internationale l'Italie. ne derni\u00e8re delegate of Saudi Arabia. I think the draft sentence as it stands without the amendments conveys the impression that IFAD is on a life-support system and that its survival depends on when the support system would be withdrawn the donor countries. Therefore, this ought to be modified. With regard to the point made by the delegate of Congo, I think we should retain the words Council the delegate of Saudi Arabia who suggested a deletion, and he now a ccepts that these words could be retained in the way that I am going to formulate it: \"...the Council regretted the lower level of the second replenishment and called on the international community to support efforts that were being made in order to ensure for IFAD a secure and stable financial basis\". Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Hab\u00eda pedido la palabra antes, pero yo creo que solamente en el texto castellano no nos lleg\u00f3 la fecha 1986 que, en cambio, si fue le\u00edda en ingl\u00e9s por nuestro Presidente. Hay que poner 1986, 27 de noviembre. -510- Apoyamos todas las propuestas, particularmente las ultimas aclaraciones de los Embajadores de Congo y de Paquist\u00e1n. Agradecemos a T\u00fanez, Arabia Saudita y Y\u00e9men su participaci\u00f3n y as\u00ed queda pos itivo el llamado en favor del FIDA. LE PRESIDENT: Si le Conseil pourrions ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Voy a volver a leer en ingl\u00e9s Dir\u00edamos as\u00ed: Contin\u00faa en ingl\u00e9s: \"The Council noted with satisfaction that the second replenishment of IFAD became effective on 27 November 1986 . It regretted the lower level of the second replenishment and called on the international community to support efforts that were being made in order for IFAD to continue its useful role on a stable financial basis\" Continued in Spanish: Espero que la traducci\u00f3n a todos los idiomas haya sido adecuada. Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of): I should like to support fully what the Chairman has said. Let us move to another paragraph. M. Afzal QADIR (Pakistan): I would like it to be \"secure and stable basis\", if the word \"secure\" could be added. LE PRESIDENT:... assurer une base stable... that formulation is perfectly acceptable, but even at the cost of appearing a bit hard I think \"with satisfaction\" is not consistent with the situation. We could just say \"noted\". I think we could delete the word \"financial\" because \"stable\" includes \"financial\". So we could and delete \"financial\". Mrs. Mlllicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): We support exactly what the Chairman of the Drafting Committee has just read out. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Yo le agradezco porque Venezuela est\u00e1 obligada en su calidad de miembro del FIDA a expresar aqu\u00ed su respaldo a la posibilidad de que el FIDA mantenga su estabilidad y la posibilidad de seguir desarrollando el trabajo que ha venido haciendo hasta ahora, pero para no hacer una intervenci\u00f3n anal\u00edtica me limito a respaldar plenamente lo expresado por nuestro amigo el Embajador de Arabia Saudita y la proposici\u00f3n hecha por mi vecino de la derecha el Embajador del Y\u00e9men, que tengo a mi lado. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I do not see why we should change the wording \"the Council regretted that it failed to attain its target level\"\u00b7 That is much more the truth than talking about \"lower level\". It is not the fault of some countries. You know the reason\u00b7 do not want any mention of \"lower level\", but \"target level\". I think that was perfect wording, and I do not see why we should change it. LE PRESIDENT: Si je comprends bien, serait d'accord (Yemen, People's Democratic Republic of): If a target level is 100 and you pay 99, that contribution has failed to reach the target level but it is a very high level. What we are interested in now is to say that it is a lower level of contribution, which really puts the picture right. LE PRESIDENT: Nous n'allons pas encore trainer sur l'objectif target for IFAD for the second replenishment? $500 million; everybody knows. How can we say it does not reach its target level? How will we know? N obody knows up to now. We are still running the second replenishment, so we cannot say it has failed to reach the target level. We have to say \"the lower level of the second replenishm ent\". The first replenishmen t was $1 billion; now it is $500 million. This is quite clear. We can say that. I would like to appeal to my friend Ambassador Pascarelli to a ccept this. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): Everybody knows why we had to lower the level. Why imply that and criticize some countries. I don't want any categories to be criticized. In any case, it was not our category that was responsible for the lowering of the level. I do not want any mention to be made here, because we criticize a group of countries and I do not intend that to be done. It is quite clear to everybody, who is in the know, the affairs of IFAD and why we had to lower the level. Why should we mention a lower level? It was not the fault of 20 members of the first category. It is quite clear we were forced to lower the level. Why should we mention that by implying a lower level? We attack, implicitly, the second category and I do not like that. M. Afzal QADIR (Pakistan): I think the argument made by Ambassador of Italy is persuasive, when he says that the that in the draft should be retained. Despite the persuasiveness, with which he argued, for the retention of the present formulation, I think that a consensus could be found around the formulation suggested by the Ch airman of the Drafting Committee. LE PRESIDENT: Il y a une sorte de convergence du conseil sur le texte presente par le president du comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. Je pose la question r\u00e9daction? Je prie M. Lopez-Portillo de bien vouloir nous lire ce paragraphe. Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): La tengo en espa\u00f1ol y en ingl\u00e9s pero la voy a leer en ingl\u00e9s. Espero que haya una traducci\u00f3n adecuada a todos los dem\u00e1s idiomas. Contin\u00faa en ingl\u00e9s: \"While the Council noted, with satisfaction, the second replenishment of IFAD became effective on the 22nd of November 1986, it regretted the lower level of the second replenishment and called on the international community to support efforts that were being made in order for IFAD to continue its useful role on a secure and R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I think there is just a poin t of English. This is the second sentence. It suggests that the Director-General prefers aid-in-kind to other forms of aid. I think that we will have to make it read that \"more aid-in-kind should be given\" although it point was that \"with satisfaction\". I think we did support this, but it was not absolutely entirely uncontroversial. There was a sort of more complicated approval in another place. Perhaps it could be left out here and the \"with satisfaction\" be removed. It does not detract from the sense and the qualified approval could be given in the discussion of the agenda item 8. 2. -512- Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Para indicar que el t\u00e9rmino de que \"se tom\u00f3 nota con satisfacci\u00f3n\" fue incluido en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de alg\u00fan debate. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Este p\u00e1rrafo sufri\u00f3 alg\u00fan debate en el Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, como lo ha dicho su Presidente, y logramos acordar esta propuesta de transici\u00f3n, \"tomar nota\"; el propio delegado del Reino Unido ha dicho que las palabras \"con satisfacci\u00f3n\" no tienen mayor significaci\u00f3n en un sentido o en otro, de manera que para evitar se reabra un debate ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s conveniente mantener este texto y aquellas delegaciones que no se sintieron tan satisfechas con esa propuesta podr\u00e1n reflejar sus puntos de vista cuando lleguemos a la parte del informe sobre el tema concreto en relaci\u00f3n con el estudio para ayuda en especie. LE PRESIDENT: Il faut lire ce paragraphe en entier, parce valeur de telle sorte que le maintien de la satisfaction est coh\u00e9rent avec la fin du paragraphe 17. Si le est d'accord, peut-\u00eatre pourrions-nous maintenir la forme le la coh\u00e9rence du paragraphe. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I was just going to say that I would not press this. I was really speaking for people I thought I had heard speak somewhat against it, but I accept LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie observations? Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Observo que tanto en el texto ingl\u00e9s como en el espa\u00f1ol el p\u00e1rrafo comienza por \"There were\" . o \"Habia\". Yo pienso que las diferencias de productividad agr\u00edcola existen en el presente, no las podemos poner en el pasado, mucho menos en este pasado condicional. Me pronuncio porque pongamos \"There are\" o \"Hay\", si es posible, lo sugiero cordialmente a nuestro Presidente del Comit\u00e9. LE PRESIDENT: Dans le texte fran\u00e7ais, il y a le terme \"il existe\". Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): S\u00ed, se\u00f1or Presidente. Yo reconozco que en muchas partes del informe se usa ese tiempo en los verbos que puede llevar, efectivamente, a error si se interpreta que se trata de una cuesti\u00f3n pasada. Aunque no se debati\u00f3 este punto en nuestros debates quiz\u00e1 el Consejo pueda reconocer alguna expresi\u00f3n que indique que es un problema que persiste. LE PRESIDENT: En fran\u00e7ais cela ne pr\u00eate pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9quivoque. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba) Nos parece que, como ha expresado el Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, estas cuestiones se han presentado siempre en la traslaci\u00f3n del idioma principal, que es el Ingl\u00e9s, al espa\u00f1ol; siempre se crea este pasado. Creo que la distinguida delegada de Venezuela tiene raz\u00f3n en que podemos en espa\u00f1ol poner igual que en franc\u00e9s \"existen amplias y crecientes diferencias...\" o \"hay...\" sencillamente, ponerlo en is is as accurate as \"there are\". I do not want to pose as a purist of the English language, but in this context \"were\" also implies \"are\". I do think this is a serious matter, we say \"as it were\". We are meeting as it were in Rome. The word \"were\" in English-we would be guided by our representative of the United Kingdom in the case of doubt but we can live with were. It would still be in the present. LE PRESIDENT: Je pense que le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction confusion. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Se puede decir que \"se observo que hay...\" o \"se observan que existen \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\"\u00b7 LE PRESIDENT: Pourrait-il redire les termes en anglais et en espagnol? Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): En espa\u00f1ol se podr\u00eda decir \"se observ\u00f3 que existen...\" o comenzar simplemente con el verbo que en ingl\u00e9s es una cuesti\u00f3n de estilo, se\u00f1ores, porque, como el informe est\u00e1 rescatando lo que se dice en los debates, por lo general se usa ese t\u00e9rmino, lo que no implica que se desconozca que esto persiste. Le digo que es una cuesti\u00f3n de estilo o de redacci\u00f3n, francamente. LE PRESIDENT: Il n'y a donc pas first sentence starting with the words \"It was suggested that in view...\" we mention forestry. Therefore, my suggestion be The of paragraph 18 starting (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Solamente para aclarar que en espa\u00f1ol me est\u00e1 llegando la traducci\u00f3n de \"montes\", yo quer\u00eda decir \"forestales\", no -514- Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): I must say that I do not like very much the language used in this paragraph-probably it was also in part of the discussions within the Programme Committee but still I do not think in the situation, when the United Nations and General Assembly and other bodies take a very clear position on the action of the racial regime of South Africa, in destabilizing neighbouring countries-we suggest that we amend this paragraph, in the second line, delete the last three words \"one country in\" and insert \"racial regime of South Africa\" and then in the next to last line, instead just to insert \"the neighbouring countries\". So that the text its deep concern about the destabilizing actions of the racial regime of South Africa, which were undermining the economic progress of the region, and it requested the Economic Community to assist the neighbouring countries to rehabilitate and maintain\" and so on. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros en t\u00e9rminos generales, estamos de acuerdo con lo planteado por el colega de Yugoslavia, en que aqu\u00ed no se puede tratar de esconder una realidad; no hay un Estado de Africa austral, es Africa del Sur, con todas las palabras, lo que ha estado en la mirilla de nuestras observaciones en este Consejo. Sin embargo, queremos expresar otra preocupaci\u00f3n de la forma en que se ha redactado este p\u00e1rrafo 21. Primero, creemos que aqu\u00ed se ha revisado toda la documentaci\u00f3n que se nos entreg\u00f3. No tenemos ning\u00fan documento que se refiera a la situaci\u00f3n del Africa austral. Nosotros no hemos analizado el Africa austral en espec\u00edfico; creo que esto es parte del p\u00e1rrafo 20, o sino, continuaci\u00f3n del p\u00e1rrafo 20, no decir que \"al examinar la situaci\u00f3n...del Africa austral, ...\" como si nosotros examin\u00e1ramos la situaci\u00f3n del Africa austral; nosotros examinamos la agricultura africana, la proposici\u00f3n que se hace, y en ese an\u00e1lisis de la situaci\u00f3n africana nos encontramos con las acciones, agresiones y acciones desestabilizadoras de un Estado que se llama Africa del sur, que es lo que debe rezar en este documento, como continuaci\u00f3n del p\u00e1rrafo 20, no como un p\u00e1rrafo distinto, porque no creo que nosotros examinemos el Africa austral en especifico; en ning\u00fan momento lo examinamos. Creo que esto la Secretarla o el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n debe de tratar de ver c\u00f3mo hace una continuaci\u00f3n si quiere mantener la numeraci\u00f3n 21, pero una continuaci\u00f3n del an\u00e1lisis, fue dentro del an\u00e1lisis del Africa donde se hicieron las observaciones sobre las acciones de este Estado contra los Estados del Africa austral, porque no hay ning\u00fan otro que est\u00e9 desestabilizando ah\u00ed y, si lo hay, que lo diga tambi\u00e9n para ponerlo. Bernard LEDUN (France): ce pays rappelle qu'en 1985, au moment de la Conf\u00e9rence de la certain de pays se sont d\u00e9solidaris\u00e9s d'une le pays (Bangladesh): It is not my intention to politicise our exchange of views on Item 21. As a member of the Drafting Committee we have had occasion to take part in the exchange of views in the Committee itself and then, as I say, we have not had the last word in drafting, we can always improve, but it is true that we had a detailed exchange of views in the Drafting Committee but the amendment of the delegate of Yugoslavia is something that I think only improves the quality of the draft and also the dimension of the draft. Now referring to the comments from my colleague in France; yes, he does have a point about pointing fingers at individual countries but then I think I would beg to differ with him in this particular case. It is the case, the efforts for the decision or the policy of the government of South Africa, as we well know, and I do not think anybody here, who may have differences in the emphasis or putting the nuances, that anybody has any difficulty in agreeing with the fact that South African policy is something which is disliked and protested by all of us here and the differences to the Resolutions that have been made by my colleague from Yugoslavia are a point in mind that we have adopted, or are about to adopt, in New York in the General Assembly Session. We do not see how you -515- can delete these two factors so I would appeal to my friend from France not to insist on his reservation on that, and perhaps we can agree on the amendment from Yugoslavia and get along with this \u00b7 LE PRESIDENT. Je crois qu'\u00e0 ce stade du d\u00e9bat, le Pr\u00e9sident du r\u00e9daction voudrait prendre la parole. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Solamente para decir que s\u00ed, efectivamente, este p\u00e1rrafo mereci\u00f3 alg\u00fan debate o largos debates en nuestro Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y se lleg\u00f3 a esta f\u00f3rmula de entendimiento en vista de que se mencionaba al Consejo aqu\u00ed. Pero para facilitar quiz\u00e1s a la delegaci\u00f3n de Cuba su propuesta de que se deberla vincular con el p\u00e1rrafo 20, se puede decir \"al examinar la situaci\u00f3n...\" y despu\u00e9s tachar la frase siguiente \"sobre todo del Africa austral, el Consejo expres\u00f3 su profunda preocupaci\u00f3n de las acciones desestabiliza-doras \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\"\u00b7 Aqu\u00ed quiero decirle, Sr. Presidente, que efectivamente se mencion\u00f3 en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n que no se usaba, o no deb\u00eda implicarse directamente el nombre de ning\u00fan pa\u00eds, aunque se dejaba o se deb\u00eda dejar entendido a cu\u00e1l nos refer\u00edamos. Entonces, \"...por las acciones desestabilizadoras de un estado del Africa del Sur, ...\" o como dice aqu\u00ed: \"del Africa austral, las cuales estaban minando' el progreso econ\u00f3mico en el sur de Africa\", quiz\u00e1s, y luego podr\u00edamos proceder con la propuesta hecha por la delegaci\u00f3n de Yugoslavia que dir\u00eda \"y pidi\u00f3 a la Comunidad internacional que ayudara a loe pa\u00edees vecinos o fronteras a rehabilitar y mantener su desarrollo econ\u00f3mico y social. \" En fin, el Consejo debe decidir si hacer menci\u00f3n expl\u00edcita de aquel pa\u00eds o simplemente dejarlo como referencia, pero noto como Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n que obedeci\u00f3 a cierto debate y que el arreglo o fue que se dejara toda esa expresi\u00f3n con la expresi\u00f3n del \"el Consejo\". Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo): Yugoslavie. Pour ma part, pas qu'il existe un principe en les notre Organisation, un pays cit\u00e9. Je ne pense pas que l'Afrique du Sud, qui n'est pas Membre de notre Organisation, puisse trouver dans qui Conf\u00e9rence, nous avons adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e9solution. Il y a Je voulais faire moi-m\u00eame une un peu plus dure parce que je pensais qu'il fallait rester dans le droit fil de la je m'abstiendrai de faire une seconde qui serait peu dure \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'Afrique du Sud, m\u00eame si on d\u00e9fend ce pays dans cette salle. En outre, je pense ce production ce cadre que nous sommes intervenus sans que personne nous ait demand\u00e9 de Nous l'avons cit\u00e9e nomm\u00e9ment apr\u00e8s une intervention brillante de notre ami du Zimbabwe qui est, comme vous le savez, l'Afrique Sud. L'Afrique du Sud, nous Le savons, est cit\u00e9e dans tous les pays. Bien s\u00fbr, nous ne doit pas nous emp\u00eacher d'adopter un simple paragraphe, qui ne va certainement pas changer grand chose. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): In view of the long and exhaustive discussions we had on the last Council and Conference, and considering that the Drafting Committee has brought out a very balanced text, and considering the remarks of our French friends, I would appeal to the Council not to change its text as it is given in the Draft Report. -516- Mrs. Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I do not think anybody in this room supports the policies that we know exist in this country under debate. Certainly I most firmly do not. It should be clear, what I am defending here is the effort to keep this Council meeting non-political. Yes, South Africa is going to be named, and should be, in the United Nations, and so are the conditions of Afghanistan, but not to be named here. It is proper in the United Nations where they are meeting to try to resolve the peace of the world with vetoes in the Security Council. They are proper things for a political group. We are not a political group. We are trying to increase food. It is not proper to be naming countries here. That is what I am defending, certainly not apartheid , and my colleagues know that. But this is not a political body and political questions are not properly brought to the floor. They are proper in the United Nations. Temel ISKIT (TURKEY): elements in our discussion. But we really cannot see the difference between naming a country and alluding to it while knowing which country this is. I think the politicization-if there is politicization, and we do not believe that there is politicization in this paragraph-the politicization is not in the naming. On the other hand, as other delegates said, we are not aware of the principle of naming a country. There are many instances-not perhaps as far as South Africa is concerned-where a country is named when it is necessary. So we can go along with naming South Africa, and using formulae is just avoiding the question and does not change the gist of the paragraph. So if the Council, especially those affected countries, feel so, we do not see any objection to naming these countries. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos, en principio, plantear que la politizaci\u00f3n en las discusiones de este evento la traen los que se oponen a que se diga una verdad. Al oponerse obligan a hacer algunas reflexiones sobre una situaci\u00f3n. En el documento en el cual se incluye esto que yo plante\u00e9 de que no pod\u00edamos separarnos de la iniciativa del Director General de realizar un estudio titulado \"La Agricultura Africana\", que fue en este marco donde se discuti\u00f3 esto, se habl\u00f3 de las pr\u00e1cticas que este Estado estaba diariamente cometiendo, y se pueden traer miles de hojas de toda la prensa del mundo. Sencillamente eso. Y que estaba minando el progreso econ\u00f3mico, y que no pod\u00edamos entrar a analizar la situaci\u00f3n africana sin analizar la situaci\u00f3n que confrontan y que est\u00e1n fronterizos con ese Estado. Sencillamente, lo que nosotros reclam\u00e1bamos eran dos cosas: que no se dejara esto en un estado del Africa austral, porque esto, se\u00f1or Presidente, los que lo leen o se dan cuenta de que nosotros tenemos miedo a la realidad o sencillamente puede decir esto puede ser Zimbabwe, puede ser Zambia o Tanzania, ya que son Estados del Africa austral. Creo que esa no fue la realidad de lo que se discuti\u00f3 aqu\u00ed y la historia hay que prenderla por su realidad. T\u00e9manla quien la teman. Lo que me parece que lo que hay es temor de los precedentes y la historia. Nosotros no tenemos ninguna intenci\u00f3n de politizar, ya que s\u00ed quisi\u00e9ramos politizar har\u00edamos otros an\u00e1lisis y no \u00e9stos. Por lo tanto, creemos que la propuesta que hizo Yugoslavia debe modificar este p\u00e1rrafo y adem\u00e1s aceptamos la propuesta del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n de que este p\u00e1rrafo diga: \"al examinar esta situaci\u00f3n el Consejo expres\u00f3. \" Nosotros no hemos discutido absolutamente ning\u00fan documento especifico sobre el Africa austral. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I do not think we fact I was rather struck during proceedings of the Council how little the racist regime of South Africa was attacked. It would have become a full- fledged attack on South Africa. After all, it has created endless problems for the neighbouring states. The meetings a of countries, including my own delegation and Zimbabwe, referred to South Africa by name. So to some extent that has to be reflected. We go along with a number of well wishers and friends of ours who would try to avoid opening up a Pandora's box, so that we do not want to equate South Africa with this, and I do not think it fair to do so. South Africa is a symbol of almost everything bad in what is taking place. So I think, first, that we should pay respect to the proceedings of the Council, and secondly we should try to appear as moderate as possible so that we do not politicize too much but some reference needs to be made to that country. I would suggest on the basis of what our colleagues from Congo, Cuba and Yugoslavia have stated, so that this reduces it to the level of a drafting problem and not make it into a new issue. -517- If I could suggest, with the approval of our most capable Chairman of the Drafting Committee, that we retain it as a separate paragraph, because if we link it up with paragraph 20 etc. there are certain other problems and it breaks the organic continuity of the whole thing. I suggest as follows: \"With reference to developments in we examined the situation-\"...the Council expressed its deep concern about the destabilizing actions of the regime of South Africa, which were also adversely affecting agricultural planning and production and economic progress many neighbouring countries, and it adversely affected to rehabilitate and suppo rt their economic and social development wherever n ecessary. \" I would suggest this could be the broad framework. LE PRESIDENT: Nous avons encore sept des et Cela peut-il constituer une base de compromis? Je pose la point Comit\u00e9 la forme finale. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I was just going to ask India to read it out very slowly, because there is a distinct possibility that my delegation may have to make some definitive action, either to ask for a vote or Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): \"With reference to expressed its deep concern about the destabilizing actions of the regime of South Africa, which was adversely affecting agricultural planning and production and the economic stability and progress of many neighbouring countries, and it international community to assist these countries to rehabilitate their economic and social development wherever necessary. \" The last part I prefer to write out. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Yo deseo apoyar el concepto expresado en la redacci\u00f3n propuesta por el delegado de la India, por los siguientes motivos. Cuando hablamos en el caso de Sudafrica, de sus acciones destabilizadoras, estamos hablando tambi\u00e9n en este caso, de la propuesta de la India, del impacto que tienen estas acciones en el campo de la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y, por tanto de la subalimentaria de los pa\u00edses vecinos a este pa\u00eds sudafricano. Deseo hacer una reflexi\u00f3n al respecto de este tema, y exponiendo por qu\u00e9 motivo nosotros apoyamos esta propuesta de la India. El caso de Nicaragua es inverso al de Sudafrica. Sudafrica es un pa\u00eds agresor, sin embargo Nicaragua es un pa\u00eds agredido. Los efectos en Nicaragua han tenido una enorme consecuencia en el sector de la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y en la de consumo de alimentos. En el Consejo, en per\u00edodos anteriores se ha mencionado a Nicaragua espec\u00edficamente como pa\u00eds agredido, se han minado los puertos, se ha minado el comercio, se han lesionado tambi\u00e9n medidas econ\u00f3micas de car\u00e1cter coercitivo que afectan a la producci\u00f3n de alimentos y a la situaci\u00f3n alimentaria de Nicaragua. Por tanto creo que no deberla extra\u00f1arnos que actualmentee en esta discusi\u00f3n nos vayamos a encontrar con obst\u00e1culos que impidan adoptar propuestas de texto como la presentada por el delegado de la India\u00b7 LE PRESIDENT: de compromis, d'Afrique du est Le texte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction nous sommes certainement pas des d\u00e9fenseurs du r\u00e9gime de l'apartheid. Il y a un abus de langage de sa part. Il y a de notre part une volont\u00e9 de garder ce caract\u00e8re technique \u00e2 cette des heures sur ce point. Le probl\u00e8me est clair et se concentre sur un point: faut-il dire, nommer l'Afrique du Sud ou Le de passer au vote car nous ne pouvons pas nous avancer. Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Deseo aclarar un punto. En la propuesta de la India, por lo menos en espa\u00f1ol no me llega el que se est\u00e9 mencionando a tal pa\u00eds. En la versi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola se est\u00e1 hablando de Africa del Sur, no del r\u00e9gimen de Sudafrica. Quiz\u00e1 es un problema de traducci\u00f3n. Por lo menos en espa\u00f1ol no se est\u00e1 mencionando al pa\u00eds. Si en franc\u00e9s se est\u00e1 mencionando ser\u00e1 que la traducci\u00f3n se expresa de otra manera, que no se diga el r\u00e9gimen de Sudafrica, sino del Sur de Africa. Pues Africa fue lo que me lleg\u00f3 en espa\u00f1ol. Quiz\u00e1 esta aclaraci\u00f3n le sirva a otros delegados a no oponerse al texto. LE PRESIDENT: Nous avons LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Yo no tengo ninguna propuesta. En espa\u00f1ol la traducci\u00f3n de lo que dijo el delegado de la India no me lleg\u00f3 la referencia al nombre del representante de Sudafrica. Ese nombre, por lo menos en espa\u00f1ol es Africa del Sur. S\u00f3lo deseo hacer esta puntualizacl\u00f3n, se\u00f1or Presidente, para ver si es un problema de traducci\u00f3n o de intenci\u00f3n. LE PRESIDENT: Le probl\u00e8me est clair. La proposition de l'Inde prend la question sur le plan \u00e9conomique cite le r\u00e9gime de l'Afrique du Sud. Voil\u00e0, c'est clair. Pour moi, il n'y KILLINOSWORTH would read \"With reference to developments in southern Council expressed its deep concern about the destabilising actione of the regime of South Africa which were adversely affecting the agricultural planning and production and the economic progress of many neighbouring countries, and it requested the international community to assist and support the economic and social development of such adversely affected countries wherever adopt\u00e9 par 32 voix contre 6. Motion carried on a show of hands La proposition est adopt\u00e9e par un vote \u00e0 main lev\u00e9e Se adopt\u00f3 la propuesta por votaci\u00f3n a mano alzada Bernard LED\u00dcN (France): If faudra faire en sorte ce que je GENERAL: Le vote a eu lieu \u00e0 main lev\u00e9e et non pas par appel nominal; par cons\u00e9quent, 11 suffira de mentionner dans une note en bas de page que ce paragraphe a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par 32 voix contre 6. PETTITT Kingdom): I was wishing to comment on the paragraph we have been talking about. We should like to make an explanation of the vote. We voted against this because despite efforts to make this paragraph a non-political one, it still appeared to be so. We did this because we regret the introduction of political issues into a technical body of this sort. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I would like to join with the declaration of vote of the United Kingdom. LE PRESIDENT: L'Italie dit la m\u00eame chose ainsi que le Danemark et les Etats-Unis. Il y a une explication de vote. Tout est clair.

Paragraphe 25. Hermann REDL (Austria): Only a small change in the last-but-one sentence of this last paragraph. The sentence should read as follows: \"Apart from FAO and IAEA and other donors, including Poland, United States of America and Canada, Austria will provide an amount of US$ 750 000 for these laboratories within the next three years. \" LE PRESIDENT: Il est I, est adopt\u00e9e El proyecto de informe de la Plenaria, Parte I, as\u00ed enmendado, es aprobado DRAFT REPORT-PART II PROJET DE RAPPORT-PARTIE II APROBACION DEL INFORME-PARTE II DRAFT REPORT-PART II (Sup. 1) PROJET DE RAPPORT-PARTIE II (Sup. 1) APROBACION DEL INFORME-PARTE II (Sup. 1) Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Es para hacerles notar que hay una hoja que tienen aparte que es la REP/2-suplemento 1 y espero que tomen nota que el p\u00e1rrafo que se incluye en tal hoja por separado vendr\u00e1 adicionado despu\u00e9s del p\u00e1rrafo 31 de este documento. LE PRESIDENT: Le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction attire l'attention sur paragraphe 31 le document suppl\u00e9mentaire to 7 Es solamente una cuesti\u00f3n de redacci\u00f3n o traducci\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol. La primer frase no se entiende su significado; por ejemplo, dice \"Al 21 de noviembre de 1986, la tasa de racaudaci\u00f3n por concepto de contribuciones representaba con mucho al menos favorable registrada en esa fecha en los \u00faltimos cuatro a\u00f1os. \" Es una cuesti\u00f3n meramente de traducci\u00f3n, no creo que eso tenga mayor problema, que la Secretar\u00eda se puede encargar de este asunto. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Quiz\u00e1s es un problema que efectivamentee aqueja solamente al espa\u00f1ol. En ingl\u00e9s dice: continua en ingl\u00e9s : \"The rate of receipt of contributions at by far the least favourable rate at that date over the last four years. \" continued in Spanish . \"Contribuci\u00f3n representaba como mucho la tasa menos favorable registrada. \" LE PRESIDENT: Y a-t-il d'autres observations? Adopt\u00e9. a query: I am uncertain whether the first sentence of paragraph 5 is correct or whether the first sentence of paragraph 16 which covers the same subject is correct. I think paragraph 16, which was the announcement that the United States had not renounced its obligation, was an earlier intervention from my colleague on the right. Paragraph 5 represents the statement when the news arrived a day or so later. They are somewhat in conflict, and I would just like a clarification. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Solamente puedo decir que la delegaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos particip\u00f3 en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y le pareci\u00f3 correcta la forma en que se expresa aqu\u00ed; de manera que me parece que si Estados Unidos no tiene ninguna objecci\u00f3n a ratificar esta f\u00f3rmula la podemos dejar como se ha redactado. Si no hay ninguna objeci\u00f3n, ninguna neceeidad de clarificaci\u00f3n por parte de la delegaci\u00f3n del Reino Unido. Mrs MiIiicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I am delighted to say that we have no objection to paragraphs 5 and 6 as stated in the report, as stated by the Chairman. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sin duda el colega del Reino Unido tiene raz\u00f3n al citar estas repeticiones, pero convendr\u00eda observar que en el p\u00e1rrafo 5 se refleja exclusivamente la posici\u00f3n de esa delegaci\u00f3n; luego, en el p\u00e1rrafo 16 se dice de nuevo, y da la ocasi\u00f3n al Consejo de que exprese su opini\u00f3n en el p\u00e1rrafo 16, por eso agradecemos a, la Embajadora Fenwick que acepte esta secuencia que corresponde a la realidad de los hechos. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I would just like to clarify this: the position, then, is that the United States at some stage will pay the full amount? Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): We have not renounced our intention to pay the full amount. What we are saying 1\u00b7 that $4 800 000 will be given now and that the rest of the $25 400 000 is frozen until 1 October 1987. Beyond that, my Government has not spoken nor given figures, but we have not at any time made a formal renunciation of our intention to pay. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Yo voy a hacer simplemente una pregunta: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 tenemos que seguir hablando del \"principal pa\u00eds? \u00bfNo podemos decir \"de un pa\u00eds\" o de \"uno de los miembros?, porque a m\u00ed me parece que esa denominaci\u00f3n del \"principal pa\u00eds\", del \"principal contribuyente\" es algo asi como incoherente con la Constituci\u00f3n democr\u00e1tica de la FAO en que no hay principales ni secundarios. Nada m\u00e1s que eso. -522- Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Quiz\u00e1 se pueda precisar diciendo \"la aportaci\u00f3n del mayor contribuyente\", pero s tenemos que hacer referencia al pais que m\u00e1s contribuye a la FAO; no es problema cuantitativo sino cualitativo a que estamos haciendo referencia aqu\u00ed. LE PRESIDENT: Pas propose the deletion of the fourth sentence in paragraph 7. It does not seem to be altogether consistent with the next sentence. Nor do I think it particularly adds anything pr\u00e8s ces solutions le moment\". C'est bien cela? George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): paragraph 7 reads: \"Accordingly, further consideration of these measures by the Council was not required at this time. \" Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): At the end of this paragraph are the words \"...of recommending one solution only to the Council\". May we say \"to the next Council\" or \"to a as\u00ed son aprobados PARAGRAPHS 8 to 36 PARAGRAPHES 8 \u00e0 36 PARRAFOS 8 a 36 Nous passons paragraphe 11. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): En realidad, como en una serie de p\u00e1rrafos tambi\u00e9n que vienen despu\u00e9s del 11, se menciona al mayor contribuyente, quisi\u00e9ramos proponer una inversi\u00f3n en el orden de las causas del porqu\u00e9 de las dificultades financieras de la FAO. En el p\u00e1rrafo 11 se menciona que \"en primer lugar, el problema financiero se debe a una reducci\u00f3n de los tipos de inter\u00e9s...\" dice despu\u00e9st \"en segundo lugar.... . , debe a que Eitadom Miembros no hab\u00edan podido pagar sus cuotas integramente\". paro, \"en tareer lugar, y por primera vea, la FAO se estaba enfrentando eon eats problema financiere per la virtual eartasa de un d\u00e9fiait considerable on el page del mayor contribuyente\u00b7\" Intonsas\u00b7 el orden ee el inverso. In primar lugar, al problema ee debe, a que hay una reteneiSn de contribuoionee del mayor contribuyente. Esa es mi propuesta si se acepta esta propuesta cambiando el orden del resto de las prioridades o enumeraciones, se deber\u00eda mencionar \"como en el pasado, no todos los otros Estados Miembros \", agregar la palabra \"otros Estados Miembros habr\u00edan podido pagar ya sus cuotas Integramente\", ya que hemos hablado en primer lugar del mayor contribuyente. Y, posteriormente, hablamos de los otros palees contribuyentes. Espero que est\u00e9 clara la propuesta. -523- Almir F. de S\u00e1 BARBUDA (Brazil): I should like to give my full support to the prop osal by the delegate of Nicaragua. I was going to propose something similar myself. I do believe that we should say that the main cause of the shortfall is the shortfall in the payment of the largest contributor. Therefore, that should be the first cause mentioned in this paragraph. LE PRESIDENT: On nous propose de le paragraphe. Cela croyais savoir que Comit\u00e9 r\u00e9daction \u00e9clairer sur ce point. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I think perhaps this could best be explained by the fact that this comes from some of the wording that FAO is required to use. Until the final accounts are all in they have to use the words \"virtual certainty\" rather than trying to protect the United States. I assure you all that there is no design here to protect my country. So now I think we can all take the language that is necessary under the technical vocabulary that advanced economists must use. Ello PASCARELLI (Italy): I agree with what the distinguished delegate of the United States has said, the word \"certainty\" is all right with me. I would like to request an explanation of the word \"shortfall\". The delegate of the United States concurred in confirming paragraph 5 and paragraph 16. Would it not be more correct to say that \"that is a certainty\" or \"a virtual certainty of a shortfall\", but because of the delay in the payment and not take it for granted that it is a cut, because as it is expressed here it looks like a cut once and for all. But we still have a firm conviction that the United States will meet its full obligations. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I think part of the problem which arisen here is that because as the drafting took place you did not have an indication of how much the United States would contribute and, therefore, you have put it forward. At this stage it was, \"the virtual certainty\" whereas in the earlier paragraphs it has become what it is. I think that needs to be properly reflected. I will not make an y more suggestions. I think it is best to say, \"Thirdly, the FAO was faced with a significant shortfall in the payment of the largest\", because you have spelled it out in detail in advance. You can not use the word \"virtual\". Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos hacernos eco de las proposiciones que ha hecho el distinguido representante de Nicaragua con respecto a cambiar el orden de los puntos en el p\u00e1rrafo 11. Creemos que eso le da un ordenamiento m\u00e1s l\u00f3gico y m\u00e1s objetivo. Adem\u00e1s, nosotros tambi\u00e9n apoyamos la proposici\u00f3n que ha hecho la distinguida representaci\u00f3n del Congo, a mi izquierda, en cuanto a que la palabra \"virtual\" nos sigue dando una incerteza de una situaci\u00f3n que ya no es incerteza, que es cieta; en el p\u00e1rrafo 5, ya decimos con cifras totales lo que se va a pagar en 1986 y lo que se va a recibir en 1987 y lo que queda pendiente y al final, no se facilita ninguna informaci\u00f3n acerca de la facha y cuant\u00eda de los pagos de la contribuci\u00f3n para 1987 , cuyo menso ea 4 a 90 millones. Cree que m\u00e1s que el desarrolle ee caer en ambiguedades y en una situacion que deepu\u00e9e nos hace perder la credibilidad a nosotros cambien. Creo que no debemos perder la credibilidad y decir las coass por su nombre. No hay nada reglamentado sobre lo que la terminolog\u00eda debe ear Dobunes nor redlietae sencillamentae ando es le realidad No catay queriendo ataeer ni defender a nadie ellos han explicado les raaonee y punto, pero es la realidad y debe eliminarse la palabra \"Virtual\". -524- Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Una peque\u00f1a clarificaci\u00f3n. Este asunto, efectivamente, se debati\u00f3 en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y la delegaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos nos hizo ver que ser\u00eda excesivo marcar que hab\u00eda una certeza absoluta respecto de tal acontecimiento, en vista de que no se sab\u00eda todav\u00eda si pagar\u00edan el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o con el resto de sus contribuciones; es m\u00e1s, no hab\u00eda dicho nada al respecto y, por tanto, este Consejo no pod\u00eda informar de que hab\u00eda una incertitumbre respecto del d\u00e9ficit que, por otra parte, no se trata de un recorte, sino de un d\u00e9ficit; quiero aclararlo. Lo aclar\u00f3 la delegaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos y el Comit\u00e9, despu\u00e9s de partir de la inclusi\u00f3n de la palabra \"virtual\", reconoci\u00f3 que eso respond\u00eda a la situaci\u00f3n. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): I wonder if I could assist the delegation by perhaps the final sentence reading \"Thirdly, FAO was faced, for the first time, with a significant shortfall in the payment de ce retard versement, ce qui est d'ailleurs compatible avec le que principal retient-il ce libell\u00e9? Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos expresar nuestro total acuerdo con la formulaci\u00f3n que nos ha dicho en estos momentos la distinguida representaci\u00f3n de Canad\u00e1. Creo que eso recoge la situaci\u00f3n en definitiva. Lo que quisi\u00e9ramos era primero enfrentar el d\u00e9ficit considerable, la palabra \"considerable\" puede entrarse a modificar, creo que no alterar\u00eda esto, pero la proposici\u00f3n de Canad\u00e1 se ajusta a una realidad tambi\u00e9n y no tenemos que entrar en otras palabras que puedan crear problemas. Ello PASCARELLI (Italy): I do not think this proposal by the delegate of Cuba would answer my question. As you pointed out, I think you were correct in saying that it strikes out against the statements in paragraphs 5 and 16, confirmed by the delegate of the United States. We have to take as a certainty that there will be a delay. We should not say that that is a shortfall as a shortfall is a cut. I would prefer to say, (India): The view of the distinguished and charming delegate of the United States is very important on this matter. No one is really criticizing. There is one question of delay, that there is a commitment which cannot be fulfilled and that is quite obvious. The major item of the entire discussion of the financial and other problems is based or the next two or three years; we are not talking about 50 years, so there is an immediate problem where that money is not forthcoming. The question of a delay-that it may be three years, four years or five years later-concerns the Conference. I would personally think that what has been suggested, if agreed to by our distinguished representative of the United States, could be either thirdly or firstly, I do not feel very strongly about the order because frequently the most important matters are mentioned last rather than first. Even in boxing the last blow is the one that strikes you. Therefore, here I would say, \"The FAO was immediately faced\" or some words like that, \"For the first time\", and strike out the words \"with the virtual certainty of a say \"The FAO was immediately faced, for the first time, with a significant shortfall in the payment by the largest contributor\" if agreed to by the representative of the United States. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): Agreed, Mr Chairman. -525- Horacio CARANDANG (Ph ilippines): With all due respect to those who have spoken before me, I would like to express a preference for the wording that is now indicated in the text. This has long been debated during the Drafting Committee. We are really talking here about the budget of 1986/87. Therefore, the argument that this was made during the time when the United States had naturally indica ted its contribution for 1986, pr obably does not dispel the uncertainty with regard to the contribution for 1987. Furthermore, I believe that this conveys clearly thoughts that occur during the think that if this formulation is agreeable to the United States and to the other delegations, we could probably live with this formulation as indicated in the draft, because this has been the subject of a long discussion during the adoption le de r\u00e9daction? Philippe PIOTET (France): En ce qui concerne je ne faut phrase claire la faite par le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de l'Inde et a ccept\u00e9e par les Etats-Unis va bien en ce sens. Pour ma part, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re que l'on dise: \"la la place \"troisi\u00e8mement\" \u00e2 place du \"premi\u00e8rement\". 11 le paragraphe 14. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Creo que en este p\u00e1rrafo hay una motivaci\u00f3n muy amplia que no adopto el Consejo en cuanto a que la ra\u00edz del problema se hallaba en la legislaci\u00f3n interna del principal contribuyente. Es decir, existe toda una frasolog\u00eda que tiende a justificar esa legislaci\u00f3n interna que me parece en este caso fuera de orden. La primera frase seria asi: el Consejo estuvo de acuerdo en que el d\u00e9ficit en las contribuciones previsto para 1986-87, era b\u00e1sicamente diferente del tipo de atrasos registrados hasta el momento. La segunda dir\u00eda: la ra\u00edz del problema Se hallaba en las medidas legislativas del principal pa\u00eds contribuyente. A partir de ah\u00ed, se eliminar\u00edan las justificaciones o modificaciones puesto que no fue adoptado por el Consejo, de acuerdo con la frase principal que dice: El Consejo estuvo de acuerdo con el problema del d\u00e9ficit, eliminando todo lo que va despu\u00e9s de: motivadas sobre todo por la preocupaci\u00f3n interna de reducir el d\u00e9ficit, etc. , etc. Hasta donde dice: \"Naciones Unidas\". Ahl seguir\u00edamos diciendo \"muchas delegaciones expresaron\". Quedar\u00eda as\u00ed el texto eliminando todo el cuerpo del texto del centro entre las frases que yo estoy uniendo en estos momentos. No s\u00e9 ai el Prealdente del Comit\u00e9 capt\u00f3 la idea, S\u00ed desean se la vuelvo a repetir. Igual la segunde fraee. La primera quedar\u00eda come est\u00e1 y la segunda dir\u00eda: la ra\u00edz del problema se hallaba en lee medidas logislativas del principal pa\u00eds contribuyente. Despu\u00e9s continuar\u00eda: muchas delegacionee expresaron su firme convicci\u00f3n de que la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n por la que atravesaba la FAO , y la previsible en el futuro, era en buena parte causada por las decisiones del principal contribuyente, y el resto como est\u00e1. Lo \u00fanico es eliminar lo que est\u00e1 entre la segunda frase pero poner que termine en contribuyente. Tambi\u00e9n unirla con aquella que comienza por: Muchas delegaciones expresaron. -526- George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): Our delegation prefers the paragraph as it is with the exception that we would suggest the addition of one word in sentence thr ee, that following \"the United Nations\" we add as follows \"it was also partly due to a desire, on the part of public opinion in that country for change in the United Nations system, rather than to a negative attitude to the roles and programmes of Specialized Agencies. \" LE PRESIDENT: Vous (Canada): No, simply in the third the words Danilo to be clear in my suggestions and I hope that this may give ground for solution. The first sentence remains as it is. Second, I would like that we should give clarification to the further statement after the first sentence and which is in fact the explanation or clarification given by the representative of largest contributor. So we should take it as taking note of the clarification of the largest contributor, instead of Council's considering this matter as such. So my proposal would be that the first sentence remains as it is. Then the second sentence begins with \"The Council also noted the the legislative action in his country\" instead of \"in the main contributor country, \" because it is an explanation of the representative of the country \"in his country\", or \"her country\" in this case, and then I think that the proposal to add the word \"system\" probably is more correct and expressed what the politicians in the United States have said about the United Nations, so I have nothing against the words \"system\" after \"United Nations\". Then the last line of the same paragraph, I would like to delete the word \"Consequently\" and say \"Many members expressed...\"\u00b7 Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Hemos tomado de la sugerencia haciendo une precisi\u00f3n en relaci\u00f3n a la tercera oraci\u00f3n y la propuesta formulada por la delegaci\u00f3n del Canad\u00e1, esto se discuti\u00f3 y se precis\u00f3 que quiz\u00e1 a lo que se refer\u00eda la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica de dicho pa\u00eds, era no a todo el sistema de Naciones Unidas, sino a Naciones Unidas, y se dej\u00f3 el t\u00e9rmino, por tanto, sin la palabra sistema de Naciones Unidas. En vista de que quiz\u00e1 la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica no considera que era negativa la totalidad del sistema donde estaban incluidos todos los Organismos, esa fue la raz\u00f3n por la que no se introdujo el t\u00e9rmino \"sistema\". Respecto a lo dem\u00e1s no tengo ning\u00fan comentario. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Lamentablemente, se\u00f1or Presidente, tenemos que expresar que los mismos que se equivocaron ahora, ya que fue un error, se lo digo claro, ya que no me gusta gastar el tiempo, malgastar el tiempo. Los mismos que se equivocaron politizando el punto anterior, que nos dio tanto trabajo, est\u00e1n tratando de politizar \u00e9ste, introduci\u00e9ndonos cuestiones ajenas a los problemas de la FAO. En esto nosotros estamos totalmente claros de qu\u00e9 fue lo que expuso una declaraci\u00f3n, pero yo puedo exponer mis criterios y hay que ponerlos aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n. Primero, es muy real que fueran medidas legislativas del principal contribuyente. Aceptado. Esas son medidas de ellos. Nosotros podemos tener un criterio, pero eso no vamos a discutirlo aqu\u00ed, aunque yo discut\u00ed eso y no se incluy\u00f3 aqu\u00ed. Referente al d\u00e9ficit presupuestario, creo que tampoco debemos incluir una cuesti\u00f3n; son sus medidas legislativas pero no creo que nosotros tengamos que poner eso aqu\u00ed como causa principal. Sabemos que se gastan millones en otras cosas y no en las Organizaciones del sistema. El d\u00e9ficit no va a reducirse porque le dejen de pagar a FAO. Hay que decir esto que yo digo si quieren entrar a discutir. Sobre la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica de dicho pa\u00eds, tambi\u00e9n niego eso. La opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica de ese pa\u00eds se expresa a trav\u00e9s de las elecciones y yo no creo que se hayan hecho unas elecciones para decidir si la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica americana est\u00e1 de acuerdo con el sistema de Naciones Unidas o no. No se ha hecho. Ademas de que cuando se haga, va a tener un porcentaje muy grande de abstenciones. -527- Por lo tanto yo quisiera que no se me permitiera seguir, porque voy a continuar politizando lo que han empezado a politizar ellos. Yo creo que est\u00e1 muy clara la proposici\u00f3n de Nicaragua de que el Consejo de acuerdo en que el d\u00e9ficit de las contribuciones previsto para el 1986-87 era b\u00e1sicamente diferente del tipo de atrasos registrados hasta el momento y la ra\u00edz del problema se halla en las medidas legislativas del principal contribuyente. Muchae delegaciones expresaron su firme convicci\u00f3n de que la dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n (y aqu\u00ed venir atr\u00e1s). Creo que esto debe desaparecer, porque eso es politizar la discusi\u00f3n y vamos a politizarla porque entonces yo voy a tratar de exponer mis criterios sobre esta situaci\u00f3n. Y creo que Naciones Unidas, me lo han dicho veinte veces aqu\u00ed, que las cuestiones po l\u00edticas no deben venir aqu\u00ed. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 los problemas pol\u00edticos internos de ese pa\u00eds vienen aqu\u00ed? Vamos a tener que no hacer excepciones y no permitir que se hable ni de medidas legislativas, ni de d\u00e9ficit presupuestario, ni de opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, porque yo tambi\u00e9n tengo opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Creo que Nicaragua ha planteado muy sencillamente que eran justificaciones dadas por una delegaci\u00f3n y no creo que debamos discutirlas\u00b7 Posteriormente, se hace un an\u00e1lisis de algunas situaciones, pero ese p\u00e1rrafo no creo que pueda aceptarse en la totalidad como est\u00e1 planteado y m\u00e1s queriendo ahora incluir al sistema. Sabemos que esos son los objetivos, pero no queremos traerlos aqu\u00ed a discusi\u00f3n. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I do not think it would be a great surprise to anybody, what Nicaragua and Cuba have said, I think is quite sensible: no politics, cut it all out. LE PRESIDENT: Excusez-moi, mais il y a un point d'ordre de la part du d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Congo. Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo): Oui, des Etats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique, et on lui donne la parole avant moi. Je ne sais pas pourquoi. LE PRESIDENT. Vous avez la parole, d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Congo. TCHICAYA (Congo): que ce que je voulais dire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 dit. Je suis je ce qu'a dit d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 continue this. I think there is a general agreement that though this has been carefully the discussions in the Drafting for us to go into all the domestic motivations of the largest contributor-firstly, we do not summarise it correctly. It has no significance. It is best to keep the two sentences as agreed. The United States has agreed to what Nicaragua has suggested, it is a rare unanimity and we really can pass on to the next one. LE PRESIDENT: Je crois que le probl\u00e8me est clair. fonda la base du probl\u00e8me paragraphe 14 tel que noue venons de le lire et tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 par le Nicaragua et eppuy\u00e9 Cuba? Adopt\u00e9. to in conjunction with paragraph 5 and indeed does repeat in the first part of the sentence the same sentiments expressed at that time. However, we do not think it expresses entirely what the delegate of the United States said at the time. He was asked, as I recall, by the Secretariat, indeed by the Director-General himself, whether the United States had renounced its obligations, and they said they had not, to their knowledge, renounced them. But he also said neither could he make a judgment as to whether Members were unduly pessimistic or optimistic, and he could confirm when or if the shortfall would be paid. words: \"even though it could when or if the shortfall would be paid. \" PRESIDENT. d'apr\u00e8s I think the \"when delegation would to the future\" would perhaps be more in line with what we have understood from our Government. LE Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, I was going to intervene in this paragraph because before we had the confirmation from Her Excellency the Ambassador of the United States and she confirmed that she accepts this paragraph, she was in the Drafting Committee. So I do not see any reason for modification. Let us take it as it is. LE PRESIDENT: Mme Fenwick est-elle d'accord? Nous a-t-il des G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I have a suggestion for the last sentence. I think one should acknowledge the situation\". One would add another sentence, picking up what he said in his first intervention in the Council: \"It was noted that actions taken his colleagues in charge of other United Nations bodies in similar difficulties. \" Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Fue le\u00edda tan r\u00e1pida la propuesta que no alcanzamos a tomarla. LE PRESIDENT: Y a-t-il G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): word, \"available\", same sentence: would continue to do Then a new sentence: \"It was studying actions taken his colleagues in charge of other United Nations bodice in similar difficulties. \" That is the end. -529- Philippe PIOTET (France): Je voudrais peine de l'introduire maintenant. LE PRESIDENT: Le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la France note le paragraphe m\u00eame que c'est dans ses deux composantes ou dans une de ses composantes? En effet, dans ce que vient de dire le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni, il y et d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la France a signal\u00e9 que le paragraphe 25 reprend la premi\u00e8re des remarques de H. le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I fully agree with your explanation, Mr Chairman, and so there rests the second part of the British proposal which I want to support. LE PRESIDENT: Il nous est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de rajouter \u00e2 exact wording proposed by the delegate of the United Kingdom, I would like to suggest a small change in it. He suggested the following words: \"studying action taken by his colleagues in other United Nations bodies\", because it is the action taken by the governing bodies as well as the Secretariat that has to be taken into account. LE PRESIDENT: Est-ce que notre Comit\u00e9 peut nous sugg\u00e9rer une formulation? Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): S\u00ed, al final de la ultima oraci\u00f3n que dice: \"El Consejo reconoci\u00f3 que el Director General habla examinado las ventajas respectivas de todas las opciones disponibles y que estaba examinando las medidas de otros organismos de Naciones Unidas que se encontraban en condiciones similares. \" Atif Y. BUKHARI (Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of): I just want to say that I fully support what the Deputy Director- General said. It is clearer. (Bangladesh): I have a small phrase to add to the present paragraph 19. After the word \"million\" add \"subject to adjustment in the context of the position stated in paragraphs 25 and 26. \" LE PRESIDENT: Nous sommes saisis proposition r\u00e9serve aux 25 r\u00e9daction est d'accord? -530- Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Co mit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Su reserva del ajuste dentro del tenor de las distribuciones de los p\u00e1rrafos 25 y 26\u00b7 Quiz\u00e1 lo debo leer en ingl\u00e9s. Yo no tengo ning\u00fan comentario, salvo decir que la delegaci\u00f3n de Bangladesh estuvo de acuerdo con los textos como se han presentado en el informe durante los debates del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I would prefer, as one who was not in the Drafting Committee, to keep the formulation as it is, because on the one hand paragraphs 25 and 26 refer to maximum flexibility, paragraph 26 refers to the special importance attached to certain things, which he has to attach, but here it is a clear decision that this US$16. 4 million should be made. There is no contradictio n. I do not think there is any need for a safeguard. LE PRESIDENT: Le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de tout qui comprend 19 et les paragraphes 25 et 26. traitent de la question amplement\u00b7 Si Conseil en est d'accord, nous pourrions le paragraphe 19 dans la forme telle que propos\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. Waliur RAHMAN (Bangladesh): This is regarding my amendment that I tabled on paragraph 19. In view of the position expressed by my delegation, I would not insist on the retention of that and withdraw that. LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie infiniment le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 pour sa compr\u00e9hension et nous passons \u00e2 l'analyse du point 20. Y des observations? PETTITT (United Kingdom): I to suggest th e insertion of a sentence in the paragraph possibilities of economies in regional offices and field representation. \" Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sin duda el colega del Reino Unido tiene raz\u00f3n porque esas pocas delegaciones se refirieron a esos dos aspectos concretos, pero espero que usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, y los miembros del Consejo reconozcan tambi\u00e9n que muchas otras delegaciones apoyamos las Oficinas Regionales y la representaci\u00f3n de la FAO en los pa\u00edses; de manera que si el Reino Unido presenta esa adici\u00f3n nosotros tendr\u00edamos que redactar nuestra posici\u00f3n y esto har\u00eda interminable el texto del proyecto de informe. Serla m\u00e1s conveniente que adopt\u00e1ramos el texto tal como est\u00e1. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): We should like to support the proposed amendment made by the delegate of the United Kingdom. While we have the floor perhaps we could point out to our good friend, the delegate from Colombia, that the first sentence of paragraph 21 should adequately cover his concern respect. TCHICAYA d\u00e9but r\u00e9diger un texte pour contrebalancer le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Si el colega del Reino Unido insiste en su propuesta yo estoy dispuesto a presentar la nuestra. -531- Mohammed ABDELHADI (Tunisie): La delegation et le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Congo concernant les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux et les repr\u00e9sentants de la FAO dans ces pays. Victor HJORT (Denmark): My delegation would like to support the amendment by the United Kingdom delegation, and as also stated by the Canadian delegate. We think that the wording in paragraph 1 the proposed amendment to 20 Having spent in the group, like the delegate of Colombia I would appeal to the other delegates not to put in any more words here as the addition of these words would again complicate our lives. There has already been mention of possible savings, and if you begin to mention now particular programmes then it is very clear that the great majority of the Council have indicated a preference for the regional offices and field representations in their countries. So you will have to rewrite the sentences again. I was wondering whether it would be possible to leave this paragraph as it is, because it took a very long time to discuss in the drafting group. I wonder if this would be acceptable to everybody. LE PRESIDENT: Je voudrais signaler que le rele du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction est de refl\u00e9ter ce dont on a discut\u00e9 rentr\u00e9s discussion au fond de ce qui se passera au-del\u00e0 de ces 16 millions 400. Nous avons dit qu'il fallait un suivi constant des forme 11 y aura un d\u00e9bat sur le fond de il (United Kingdom): Just for the record I did actually make that point in relation to regional offices. In this and in other discussions, we and others made the point about field representation and possible economies there. I put this in because there was one other proposal which was put in but it was dismissed, the Technical Cooperation Programme. Since this discussion is on the record, I will withdraw my proposal in the spirit in which has been advanced by you.

I have a paragraph saying. \"Some members drew attention to what they saw as a high level of liquidity in FAO. It was suggested that further savings could be made in programme alternative to cutting Mrs Mlllicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I was not on the the Drafting Committee, but looking at this it struck me what intelligent person could s upport a sentence says, \"Many members limitations should not be imposed on the activities and operations of the Organization as a result of financial pressure\". Who could s upport such a sentence? It is the silliest thing that I have heard. What are they going to do, print money? How did that get into the Drafting Committee, for God sake? Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Lo que yo le puedo decir al respecto \"son dos cosas: la primera que este p\u00e1rrafo se revis\u00f3 a la luz de los otros p\u00e1rrafos y de las modificaciones que hubo respecto de lo que dijeron algunos y lo que dijeron muchos, y, en segundo lugar, que la delegaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos representada en ese Comit\u00e9 estuvo de acuerdo. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sr. Presidente, despu\u00e9s de lo que ha dicho el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, yo creo que la distinguida colega Fenwick se equivoc\u00f3 de destinatario de la pregunta. En vez de preguntarle eso al Consejo ha debido pregunt\u00e1rselo a sus compatriotas que participaron en nombre de su pais en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y que aceptaron esta frase. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): This also puzzled me and that is one of the reasons why I suggested the following paragraph as this would actually square It would be possible not to impose limitations if one did economies of this sort . David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I have not spoken before in this debate, because I was a member of the Drafting Committee and I endorsed the Drafting Committee Report. I merely observe that paragraph 20 and 21 were the result of a long discussion in the Drafting Committee. They were an attempt to state two points of view. \"Some members\" in paragraph 20, and we do not say \"other members, \" but \"a lot of members, \" said things in paragraph 21. They are an attempt to find a balance. X will not make a personal comment about the last sentence, but a number of members, in the Drafting Committee, made it quite felt that a great majority of members accepted that point and we were prepared to support it on that basis. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): We do not have the being in the Drafting Committee, although we understand balance to observe. However, I cannot but agree with the distinguished delegate of the United States for reasons of logic and taking positions. We were amongst the who regretted that because of one very well known reason, we have to impose limitations on the activities of the Organization, but in its present formulation it is not log ical. If we have a shortfall we cannot avoid imposing a limitation on the activities and that is what the Director-General did. He propo sed some adjustments or cuts, so we are for the deletion of the last sentence for reasons of logic. -535- les uns et les autres ont dit. Je crois que nous avons dit que, malgr\u00e9 ces pressions financi\u00e8res, fallait le monde soit d'accord. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Efectivamente, se\u00f1or Presidente, esta \u00faltima oraci\u00f3n responde a las modificaciones que se hicieron en el p\u00e1rrafo 20 y buscaba indicar que muchos miembros pensaban que no deb\u00edan imponerse limitaciones. Quiz\u00e1 faltar\u00eda la palabra adicional . La idea de los miembros de este Consejo era que esa expresi\u00f3n condicionaba a la Organizaci\u00f3n, la obligaba a futuras limitaciones en las actividades de los programas. Quisieron expresar que no constitu\u00eda una amenaza, pero se evit\u00f3 la palabra. Eso form\u00f3 parte de nuestras discusiones y en el proceso del debate dentro del Comit\u00e9 se lleg\u00f3 a esta f\u00f3rmula de conciliaci\u00f3n. Como digo, crea que esto responde a lo que se dice en el p\u00e1rrafo 20. Temel ISKIT (Turkey): In the light of the explanations given by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee may we make a concrete proposal to find a compromise. We propose to add the word \"additional\" before the word \"limitations\" and the word \"essential\" before and (Denmark): I am getting somewhat confused, because we are talking about many things at this stage. I wanted to come in after the intervention of the delegate of Congo to oppose an additional paragraph which the delegate of the U. K. has proposed. He says that these views were dealt with in paragraph 20, which we agreed to just before lunch. I would remind the delegate of the Congo that there was an additional proposal to paragraph 20 by the delegate of the U. K. which was withdrawn. Therefore, the views have not been reflected totally in paragraph 20. For that reason, and for the purpose of having a report reflecting the debate which we have had in the Council, I would like to give my delegation'a support to the proposal forwarded by the U. K. for an additional paragraph. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I think it is the unanimous view of the Council that no one would like the activities and the operations of the Organization to be limited as a result of financial pressure. It is not a question of financial pressure it i s a question of a lack of finance. If there is a lack of finance there has to be, in effect, some cutting down of programmes as a r been steps taken. Of course, we do not like financial pressure to be direct or indirect, because they are commitments of governments . However, I think that on the whole the Council has tried its best not to pass any critical comments regarding procedures and th e action of a major country which has been a major donor, in not being able to fulfill certain commitments. There has been a cert ain amount of give and take about these matters. In the same spirit we have removed in paragraph 14 two or three sentences that it was \"motivated by, domestic concerns to reduc e the national\" that has all been removed, which means that we are not attributing motives or pressures at all. If that is the ca se, I think the alternative before the Council would be either to delete the last sentence straight off, because everything is reflec ted in the paragraph before, as suggested by the distinguished representative of the United States. I think that la consintent with th e whole body of both the events and the paragraphe, or keep it as it la, and not to add any words or another paragraph between 20 and 21. This la my suggestion. LE PRESIDENT: Nous avons financi\u00e8res ne entra\u00eener Peut-\u00eatre. ces liquidit\u00e9s, mais je ne sais pas quelle est la position du Conseil sur ce p oint pr\u00e9cis. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Como usted lo dijo muy bien, se\u00f1or Presidente, la Secretar\u00eda explico la situaci\u00f3n y muchas de las delegaciones, la mayor\u00eda de las que intervinimos en ese debate tambi\u00e9n manifestamos que esa situaci\u00f3n era satisfactoria gracias a la austeridad y a la eficacia con que se maneja la. gesti\u00f3n de la FAO. De manera que si el colega del Reino Unido ins iste en su propuesta, yo tengo ya redactada la m\u00eda. Despu\u00e9s de haber trabajado muchas horas en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, pensaba estar aqu\u00ed a la defensiva pero no tengo otra alternativa que quedarme aqu\u00ed y continuar escribiendo. Le ruego a usted, se\u00f1or President e, pregunte al colega del Reino Unido que si insiste en su propuesta la lea y luego yo presento la m\u00eda. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): My propos ition, while I did place it here because it seemed to be an explanation, or could form an explanation of the last sentence which we have now amended, stands in its own right and indeed, I was going to propose an additional paragraph thereafter reflecting the decision of the meeting and your said the Council agreed the Committee would consider the question of next regular meeting. I think I understood tha t this was the decision and the United Kingdom would discuss with the Secretariat our material and would produce a paper which would go to the Finance Committee. So I would like that there as this was a point which was raised by several countries and should therefore be Report. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): We should like to support the Br itish proposal with respect to the addition of the paragraph between paragraphs 20 and 21 . We think we are into the old problem here of the expression of minority views and we for the life of us. cannot think what the difficulty is. There have been a number of delegations who drew attention to a number of areas where the savings might be made and I think these were made in a very clear and articulate way throughout the Council and there was a request from those who were not on the Drafting Committee to have those views reflected in the records. Now if delegates feel that in so inserting there heve to be further amendments we don't mind, we have plenty of time, our delegation could stay and go on as long as anyone wants. This is a simple request and we were one of those who expressed those views and we would very much like to support what the United Kingdom has proposed. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Nosotros tambi\u00e9n tenemos buen \u00e1nimo de permanecer aqu\u00ed todo el tiempo que sea necesario, pero consideramos que es imperativo organizar el debate. El colega del Reino Unido ha hecho dos propuestas de contenido distinto. Primero hizo una sobre la liquidez y sin que us ted ni el Consejo hayan decidido nada, ha hecho otra ahora a nombre del Consejo, sobre algo que debe hacer el Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. Pido al Reino Unido que se decida y que nos indique primero cu\u00e1l es su propuesta inicial, si la retir\u00f3 o no, y que nos diga tam bi\u00e9n d\u00f3nde quiere y d\u00f3nde se ha de insertar su propuesta. R. G. PETTITT (United Kindgom): The paragraph I read earlier which, if people would like I would read again, should come after paragraph 21. A new paragraph I think because it represents a slightly different it reade \"Some members drew attention to whet they saw as a high level of liquidity in FAO. It was suggested that further savings could be made in programme as an initial alternative to cutting substantive programmes. \" Then if you like I will cover the other paragraph. I have no firm views where it goes historically. It occurred under this Agenda item. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Cordial y respetuosamente, yo le pido al colega del Reino Unido que permita al Consejo que, en primer lugar, se pronuncie sobre una propuesta que ha hecho y no nos confunda agregando m\u00e1s textos, que espere a cu\u00e1l es la opini\u00f3n del Consejo, y luego veremos la segunda. -537- LE PRESIDENT: Oui, je m'excuse, si j'ai l'Inde. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): Yes, it is a new paragraph-21 bis I suppose. That is the first sentence. The second sentence of this same paragraph is what I read out. Shall I read it again? The next sentence reads, \"It suggested as initial alternative de dire, certains s ont attir\u00e9 \u00e9conomies sur le Royaume-Uni \u00e9 FAO et sur la recherche d'\u00e9conomies \u00e0 partir de ces liquidit\u00e9s. on va ndu, car tout est am\u00e9liorable, mais ne refaisons pas ici le travail du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. Nous sommes le Conseil de FAO, la derni\u00e8re \u00e0 discuter de ce rapport. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): El colega de Francia ha expresado una opini\u00f3n que debe hacer reflexionar a los miembros del Consejo, sobre todo, esto lo digo con respeto pero con firmeza, a aquella delegaci\u00f3n que parece haber adquirido el vicio incorregible de pretender en cada sesi\u00f3n del Consejo destruir el trabajo cuidadoso y profundo que realiza el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3 n. Se\u00f1or Presidente, yo tengo ya, le repito, el texto de la opini\u00f3n de la gran mayor\u00eda de las delegaciones; he tratado de ser casi tan extenso como el colega del Reino Unido, casi tan extenso, de manera que si \u00e9l insiste yo leo mi propuesta y as\u00ed tendremos un p\u00e1rrafo kilom\u00e9trico, pero h\u00e1gase la voluntad de quienes creen que hay miembros privilegiados en el Consejo. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Yo quiero suscribir cada una de las palabras que fueron pronunciadas por el delegado de Francia. Como Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n yo hago un llamado a este Consejo que no pretenda convertirse en tal Comit\u00e9. Todas estas cuestiones se trataron en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y llegamos a una conclusi\u00f3n. No era debido ni necesario como lo dije al principio de mi intervenci\u00f3n al presentar el informe, no era debido ni necesario presentar los detalles de las distintas posici ones porque si no, no terminar\u00edamos nunca; inclusive nos rem itimos tambi\u00e9n a las directrices que usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, estableci\u00f3 en torno al tratamiento de ciertos temas come este y el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n tom\u00f3 nota de que en los verbatim se detallaban las posiciones de cada una de las delegaciones y cada una de esas posiciones tiene igual peso, lo subrayo, tiene igual peso se trat e de un pa\u00eds como de otro pals y que, por tanto, ese universo, esa constelaci\u00f3n se puede rescatar en este informe; pero si la preten si\u00f3n de este Consejo es convertir el informe en un verbatim , entonces nunca terminaremos. Yo a trav\u00e9s de usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, hago un llamado a los miembros del Consejo para evitar que esto se convierta en un Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. -538- LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction \u00e2 appel que les proc\u00e8s-verbaux du Conseil existent il y le Kingdom sake I would like to s upport the proposal that came from my colleague of France. Let us be on the level about our responsibilities. We are here to be constructive not destructive. We are wasting a whole lot of time over this. Who chose the Drafting Committee? We did choose them. They are from this Council and we have to give them the confidence. We gave them the confidence so I cannot see any reason for any member himself to stress and impose his opinion in different paragraphs. It was not like that. I am not new in dealing with this kind of matter, but I have never seen anything like this in my life. We are responsible people. We did not come here to waste time. I really would like to appeal to my friends, all of you, to take their responsibilities in a sincere way. We have in front of us only three or four hours or five h ours. I do not know when we can finish this. LE PRESIDENT: Il y a effectivement probl\u00e8me: le Comit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un part du Conseil; et je leur demande afin de ne alourdir Un probl\u00e8me est pos\u00e9 par le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la France, par le Pr Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I have a compromise to propose. I wish I had never brought this up. I lunched by myself and had an opportunity to read it, and I thought it was foolish and I could not believe that we would have to subscribe to it. But I have been in signalled consultation with my friend, the delegate of Colombia, and we would like to suppo rt Turkey, because it seems to me that that leaves the intent of that sentence, by adding additional limitations to essential programmes and practices. In other words, it is merely a definition of intent, and the delegate of Colombia and I feel that the Turkish suggestion is excellent and we hope it could be compromise by all. LE PRESIDENT: MUSGROVE (Canada): Again I see it as the attempt of some to censor the views of others who do not wish them in the document. We for one had expressed our wish to be on the Drafting Committee and we were unable to be there. We were not otherwise represented on the Committee. We have views to express. We feel that they should be expressed here. It is not unusual, Mr Chairman, and I do apologise for your presence here when we get into these drafting exercises. It has been the unfortunate practice all too often in the past that we go into this sort of exercise, and for the very same reasons, the wish o f some countries not to allow the views of the minority to be reflected. If this paragraph is to be left as it is we would simply put a reservation with respect to paragraph 20 behalf of our indicating expresses our views and indicating the deficiencies, and that could be put at the bottom of the page. If it is the wish of the Council to adopt that pr ocess in the interests of saving time, then we would be prepared to do so and will hand in a written reservation with respect to paragraph 20. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): It does look as though am resisting rather fiercely, but on this point X fear I will not give way. The Drafting Committee has done a splendid job and in the corridor I said this to its Rapporteur and its Chairman. But the Committee would be superhuman if it were able to identify all the points which are of particular significance to a group of countries or a country which is not on the Drafting Committee. -539- I would go along with the suggestions that one looks both at the report and the summary record for things which one could reasonably expect to look into the summary record for. I did this just before lunch\u00b7 This is a point which was of considerable significance to my delegation and to one or two others. I would therefore strongly request and quote page 111 of the Basic Texts to require it to be included as a point of view. LE PRESIDENT: M. le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du discussion ou de consensus. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Si el colega del Reino Unido insiste nosotros proponemos que en ese mismo p\u00e1rrafo se agregue lo siguiente: \"La gran mayor\u00eda de las delegaciones opinaron que la situaci\u00f3n de liquidez de la Organizaci\u00f3n era el resultado de la austeridad y eficacia aplicadas en la administ raci\u00f3n de la FAO y se aceptaron las adecuadas explicaciones de la Secretar\u00eda que presentaron muy bien esa situaci\u00f3n, a la luz de la cual no era factible ni conveniente aplicar m\u00e1s reducciones e n los programas. \" As\u00ed quedan balanceadas las dos opiniones, pero, repito, lo hacemo s muy en contra de nuestra voluntad porque no es posible que dos delegaciones pretendan siempre que se incluya lo que ellos dicen y nos obliguen a incluir lo que opinamos la gran mayor\u00eda. Ello PASCARELLI (Italy): I had asked for the floor to express my views, very close to the ones expressed by the French delegation and by the Chairman of the Drafting Committee. Italy as a Member of the Drafting here we should just make small corrections if needed to improve, but not to add or make long statements to what is written already in the Drafting Committee's report. Otherwise we will do the same as we did in the Finance Committee. If we appoint a committee we should have confidence in it, especially if it did a wonderful job. Sra. Margarita LIZARRAGA (M\u00e9xico): Como podr\u00e1 comprender, se\u00f1or Presidente, nuestra delegaci\u00f3n se hab\u00eda abstenido de participar hasta este momento por razones obvias, sin embargo, nos queremos unir al llamamiento que otros colegas del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n han hecho buscando un llamamiento a las delegaciones para no tratar de introducir el sentimiento de una o dos delegaciones, porque hubo toda una diversidad de temas que m\u00e1s de dos delegaciones presentaron y que no aparecen en este informe porque no se trata de un verbatim , se trata de un informe y debe reconocer los puntos m\u00e1s sobresalientes\u00b7 Creo que detr\u00e1s de las proposiciones que se est\u00e1n haciendo en este momento se reconoce una proposici\u00f3n que lleg\u00f3 a los miembros de este Consejo por canales no regulares, vamos a decir, y que abri\u00f3 un amplio debate en esta lenaria. Se tom\u00f3 demasiado tiempo, se reflexion\u00f3 que esto no estaba dentro de la agenda, se lleg\u00f3 a una conclusi\u00f3n de parte suya y de parte de l a Secretar\u00eda en que las representaciones involucradas se dirigieran a la Secretarla, llevaran un mayor intercambio de informaci\u00f3n y posteriormente si esto meritara ir\u00eda al Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. Esto fue reglado all\u00ed y en los verbatim consta que fue lo que pas\u00f3 y cu\u00e1l es el tratamiento que se dio. Hacemos de nuevo un llamamiento para que no se insista en esta mec\u00e1nica, con el mayor respeto, porque las 35 horas que nosotros utilizamos no alcanzar\u00edan para tratar de volver a utilizar la revisi\u00f3n de este reporter. Mohammed ABDELHADI (Tunisie): Je voudrais revenir me satisfaisant et du Conseil en Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction. Nous avons confiance dans le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction qui a bien travaill\u00e9, et qui a mis 35 heures \u00e1 faire ce travail pour nous. -540- Humberto CARRION \u00b7 (Nicaragua): Sobre el p\u00e1rrafo 21 creo que el delegado de T\u00fanez tiene raz\u00f3n; la propuesta de Turqu\u00eda ha sido ampliamente aceptada por el Consejo. Creo que usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, en relaci\u00f3n con el p\u00e1rrafo 21, la podr\u00eda dar por adoptado. En lo que se refiere a la propuesta del Reino Unido y a la de Colombia en relaci\u00f3n a un distinto p\u00e1rrafo, nosotros deseamos unirmos a la ya extensa explicaci\u00f3n que dio nuestra colega representante de Mexico que fue muy clara, muy precisa en cuanto a los antecedentes que llevaron a esa discusi\u00f3n sobre el planteamiento que hacen dos delegaciones. Tambi\u00e9n otros miembros se han referido a que no debemos en este momento convertir el Plenario del Consejo en un Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n puesto que ya han realizado su trabajo, en cuyos miem bros hemos depositado nuestra confianza. Sin embargo, deseo manifestar que en el caso de que haya insistencia por parte de delegaciones de incluir el nuevo p\u00e1rrafo sobre el costo de las inclusiones del programa, apoyamos la propuesta hecha por Colombia para complementar el p\u00e1rrafo propuesto por el Reino Unido. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: If perhaps I may be allowed to pontificate for a moment, it is extremely delicate to work out in plenary a phraseology of majority and minority views acceptable to advantage doing this in a Drafting Committee is of course that it is off the record and you can make compromises, you can reach agreements, and you can come up with a text. It is difficult to do this in a full Council session with a verbatim record where everybody is watching, is extrem ely careful about what they say, and achieving a new balance is a real problem. I do not on the other hand at all, frankly, appreci ate the suggestion that difficulties in to an attempt to stifle the views of the minority. This seems to me a m orally unacceptable viewpoint, if I may say so. If I may come now to the specific suggestions made by the United Kingdom, they deal in my view with two completely different matters. One is the high level of liquidity, alleged, and the other is the question of programme delivery costs. Those are not related. Now, the question of the level of liquidity does not need to be in the group of subjects that have a \"so me members, other members\" complexion. If it is to be included I would suggest that there be a paragraph saying something s: \"In answer to questions regarding the apparently high level of liquidity of the Organization at the end of 1985, it was explain ed by the Secretariat that all these funds were comm itted for specific purposes. \" End of paragraph. That to my mind is all that needs to be said. The question of programme delivery costs and the reference to the Finance Committee is another matter which has not yet come up. Perhaps that can be dealt with in a separate paragraph. But is not inherently connected to this group of issues which we are now discussing. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I have no views on where the suggestions I made are placed. I raised them here because historically they were dealt with under this item. I do agree that the paragraph I suggested could easily be sp lit into two, and indeed Mr Walton's suggestion is an improvement on mine. The only trouble is from my point of view, he would have to say that a delegation queried this and it was agreed that this delegation would have further discussions with the Secretariat. If he wer e not satisfied the matter would be referred to the Finance Committee, which I think was the gist of our discussion. me was not particularly anxious to intervene. I have been very careful to be silent in this debate except for one short intervention. I have just got two things to say. One is that we have discussed last night in the Dr afting Committee about the role the Drafting Committee should play in this discussion. I am very disturbed in the light of that discus sion to see a number of interventions particularly by one member of that Committee, in this debate. I think the Drafting Committee h as had ample chance to have its say. I am supporting the Drafting Comm ittee's report even though there are some areas about which I have misgivings and I had understood that all other members of the Drafting Comm ittee were going to do same. Secondly, I think that we should remind ourselves of what we are trying to do here, and if you look at the rules, the Basic Tex ts of the Organization, rule VI. says \"The Director-General shall possible end of each regular session, a report embodying the text of al resolutions, recommendations, conventions, agreements, adopted or approved by the Council, including, when of minority views, to all Member Nations\", etc. -541- I am in no way supporting, or discussing, what the United Kingdom has put forward but they, and in other cases, other delegatio ns have requested that minority views be put in this report and I think that is quite in accordance with what is asked. I do not t hink it is appropriate for members of the Drafting liquidit\u00e9s est accept\u00e9. Walton donne-t-elle satisfaction au d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 Royaume-Uni? Il y a ou de la information\"? PETTITT (United Kingdom): As far as it went, I am totally happy with this and it can go wherever in the report it is considered to be most appropriate. I simply have to say that after that one has to have a sentence saying that \"a member country said it was not convinced with th is presentation. It was agreed that that delegation should have further discussions with the Secretariat and that if it were not s atisfied the matter would be referred to the Finance Committee. \" Horacio CARANDANG (Philippines): I have been requesting the floor, again to appeal to the members who adhere to the Drafting Committe's draft. Of course, I agree with the right of everybody to put his own view in the drafting group, but there should also be some other considerations. We know that if you put this kind of draft then you have to put the answer to this dr aft. For example, it was said that you have this liquidity problem, but it was pointed out that in assessing liquidity, the liab at be looked at. Furthermore, it was pointed out that even with the programme adjustments there would be a liquidity crisis at the end of the blennium. I thought that this should be put there. If you put another statement there then y ou have to put the other counter statement. Therefore, in view of all these complications I think that, as the verbatims are also part of our report, can we please consider the draft report and if we could live with it we should be happier. I should like to remind others that we who stay in Rome have all the time to sit down here, and that tomorrow probably there is going to be a strike. If you wish to continue until tomorrow we will still be here to discuss this draft. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I would not like to add to the length of this debate, but I feel compelled to speak because on th is very issue, if see the verbatim reports, I had anticipated this problem. When this note was circulated on the 17th and a ce rtain amount of heat was generated, (and light also) I intervened, I think it was on the 18th. I said that there has been a ruling by the Chair that this matter is not to be raised now, or in the course of the Conference. This was supported by someone else. Therefo re I am rather surprised that this matter, on which a ruling was made on the subject of whether the Director-General was running the Organization properly or not-of course it is a sovereign right to raise it-but it was ruled that it was not on the agenda and t hat this matter would be discussed by the delegation concerned with the Secretariat. They have discussed in a chance meeting some nine or ten months ago and the next thing that the Secretariat heard was this paper on the 17th. After this takes place, it was our understanding that there was a gentleman's agreement and after this Council meets they w ill, go and discuss with Mr Shah and Mr Crowther and they have stuck by their decision that the overhead costs are rather high. They may be right, or they may be wrong , but the findings that they come to can be submitted to the next Council or to the next Finance Committee. What is over is over. Now here, we find two things, the Deputy Director-General, out of his desire to follow this long also proposed a There no question of needing to introduce this. The fact is that there has been liquidity if not because of the austerity (as called by the distinguished representative of Colombia) at least because the very salutary anticipation of the problems of liquidity shown by the Secretariat and the Director-General. If he had not shown this anticipation you would be high and dry and there would be straight away a question of financial pressure on such an organizatio n. You would be standing there with hat in hand. I think the -542- proceedings make it quite clear that this is not correct. The fact that paragraph 20 goes so far is also something which is not acceptable to many of us but we are ready to live with paragraph 20 because it does reflect the views of a very important membe r and the work of the Drafting Committee are amply reflected, the distinguished representative of the Philippines and all of them . A lot of work has gone into it. Let us not chop and change, let it remain as it is, otherwise this will go on indefinitely. You y ourself have suggested a small compromise to the last sentence. We might stick to that. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: This is a question of liquidity, but I think the representative of the United Kingdom is still linking this to the question of programme delivery costs. On that matter, the Director-General said that if the Council wished to refer that matter to the Finance Committee it would be taken up by the Finance Committee. I do not know whether Council does or does not wish to refer it to the Finance Committee, but if it does, it could surely be dealt with in one sentence, one line, which would say something like \"The Council referred to the Finance Committee the question of regular programme delivery costs which had been raised by one La (United Kingdom): of programme delivery costs I agree significantly with Mr Walton. Page 16 of document CL PV/8 does indicate that there was a decision there to refer to the matter to the Finance Committee, and I would be happy to have a simple entry saying that the Council agreed that the question of programme delivery costs would be considered a t the next regular meeting of the Finance Committee. The other issue I think needs to be ventilated in the sense it was raised, and we had these views, the Secretariat said various things and that this matter also would go to the Finance Committee if it were so required, following discussion between the t y a eu \u00e9change de vues Royaume-Uni, discussed, which it was said would be discussed, between the United Kingdom and the Secretariat related to programme delivery costs. There was never any decision the question of liquidity as such would be discussed with the Secretariat. I think that has to be handled as another matter. It is part of the Finance Commi ttee's regular functions to look at the liquidity of the Organization, so I do not see that it needs to be referred to the Finance Com mittee; it is automatically part of its job. The essence of the liquidity issue surely remains. As I said, questions came up in the deb ate on the level of liquidity and explanations were given by the Secretariat, and that is it. I proposed a very brief text that would cover that point. POINT OF ORDER POINT D'ORDRE PUNTO DE ORDEN Sra. Dra. Graflia SOTO CARRERO (Cuba): Sr. Presidente, con mucho respeto mi delegaci\u00f3n quisiera expresarle que est\u00e1 perpleja por la forma en que se est\u00e1n conduciendo estas discusiones. Tenemos un texto que ha preparado un Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, un texto que, a nuestro entender, mi delegaci\u00f3n estaba totalmente de acue rdo con \u00e9l, Sr. Presidente. Sin embargo, hace tanto tiempo que pedimos la palabra que hubi\u00e9ramos querido unirnos a lo expresado po r la delegaci\u00f3n de Francia, por el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y por la delegaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico, declaraciones que, posiblem ente, ya nadie recuerde en la sala, porque, le repito, ha pasado mucho tiempo que solicitamos la palabra. Mi delegaci\u00f3n considera, Sr. Presidente, muy valioso el trabajo de este Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n que fue elegido justamente por nosotros y cada uno de sus Miembros. En aquel momento, parece que gozaba de toda la confianza del Consejo. En este momento, a\u00fan sigue teniendo la confianza de la delegaci\u00f3n de Cuba. Sin em bargo, Sr. Presidente, nosotros consideramos que si se mantiene n estas propuestas, si se trata de llevarnos de un tema a otro, posiblemente con la intenci\u00f3n de confundirnos, si se quieren pres entar o incluir en el informe aspectos planteados por una, dos, o a lo sumo tres delegaciones, consideramos sumamente justo que se incluya la propuesta hecha por el distinguido Embajador de Colombia y que si expresa las expresiones al respecto hechas por la mayor\u00eda de las delegaciones. Yo le pido, Sr. Presidente, en nombre de mi delegaci\u00f3n, que haga valer los Art\u00edculos del Reglament o de la Organizaci\u00f3n que a usted lo ampara, y que exhorte a los dem\u00e1s miembros del Consejo a no divagar m\u00e1s alrededor de este asunto, llev\u00e1ndonos de un tema a otro, y que se adopte -543- definitivamente, o el texto presentado por el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n que, les repito, mi delegaci\u00f3n apoya, o a\u00f1adirle los textos d el Reino Unido con el agregado del Embajador de Colombia y que, por favor, terminemos este punto y pasemos al punto siguiente. LE PRESIDENT: Au sujet des liquidit\u00e9s, il y a un le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni et un autre propos\u00e9 par le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la Colombie. On nous demande de prendre position sur cet ensemble. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Defin itivamente hoy he llegado a la convicci\u00f3n de que aquellos distinguidos colegas y amigos que viven por all\u00e1 en las agradables y lejanas ant\u00edpodas, tienen una mentalidad muy diferente de la mentalidad de quiene s vivimos en otras partes del mundo. Digo esto porque se esgrimi\u00f3 un argumento peregrino en una concepci\u00f3n prehist\u00f3rica de la \u00e9poca de las cavernas, en relaci\u00f3n sobre cual debe ser la conducta de los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. En cuanto a la liquidez, creo que todos debemos agradecerle al colega del Reino Unido que haya aceptado la propuesta del se\u00f1or Walton. En relaci\u00f3n con los costos de los programas, y la funci\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas, el distinguido colega del Reino Unido, que es t\u00e1 aqu\u00ed sentado delante de m\u00ed, me agradeci\u00f3 mi intervenci\u00f3n en ese debate cuando yo hice una propuesta flexible que voy a tratar d e recoger en la siguiente frase: El Consejo acord\u00f3 que a la luz del contenido de este informe el Director General tom\u00f3 las decisiones pertinentes de, particularmente, en relaci\u00f3n con los costos de los programas y la funci\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 de Finanzas. Esto fue, m\u00e1s o menos, lo que yo dije. El Reino Unido me lo agradeci\u00f3. Espero que ser\u00e1 aceptado, naturalmente si el se\u00f1or Walto n est\u00e1 de acuerdo y los dem\u00e1s miembros del Consejo. LE PRESIDENT: Sans vouloir allonger les d\u00e9bats, quelques a une de M. Crowther au nom de l'Organisation. Il semble a correct summary of what we would like. Is it your suggestion that it goes in the report, or is this some part of our deliberations which is recorded in the verbatim? de la s\u00e9ance. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: I do not think is on the substance ge tting into an endless drafting exercise, can we not take it as a decision which is simply recorded in the verbatim record of this meeting now ? LE PRESIDENT Ja pansa que maintenant nous sommee d'aaeetd sur la fond. IL y a engagement la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. soyons attach\u00e9e outre Quelle eat votre d\u00e9ciaion? R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I accept the proposal. -544- POINT OF ORDER POINT D'ORDRE PUNTO DE ORDEN Horacio CARANDANG (Philippines): I wanted to ask whether the Council really agreed to make the decision to study programme delivery costs in the Programme and Finance Committees. I should like a clarification on whether the Council really took this decision, and I would like to ask the Secretary or Mr Shah to tell me whether this decision has been taken. LE PRESIDENT: Je l'occasion de cette question et entendus sur le sujet; \u00e9t\u00e9 un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9, la printemps du Comit\u00e9 financ ier. Il me semble que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis pr\u00e9sence de l'organisation. M. Shah pourrait peut-\u00eatre nous \u00e9clairer sur ce point. V. J. SHAH (Director, Office of Programme Budget and Evaluation): May I refer you to the verbatim record PV/8 from page 15 onwards. This refers to the discussion which took place during the afternoon session on 20th November. There is an intervention by. the Director-General which, among things souhaite-t-il nouveau \u00e0 la suite de discussions?\" Le Conseil souhaite-t-il un nouveau document \u00e9labor\u00e9 \u00e2 Ce sont soit n\u00e9cessaire, pour moi, de lire ce proc\u00e8s-verbal qui \u00e2 la disposition de tous les a ce en rapport pr\u00e9parer document sur le co\u00fbt de l'ex\u00e9cution? sera analys\u00e9 par ordinaire. Car le Conseil \u00e9tudier un cette Comit\u00e9 financier. Est-ce que (Philippines): I am a little surprised at the way we are proceeding. I thought we were adopting a report on decisions that had been taken. Since I believe the decision was no t taken, then I doubt whether we should take this decision no w, but it is up to you, Mr Chairman. I think we should just say that no decision was taken with regard to this question. Joseph TCHICAYA Ce qu'a dit le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 des est exactement ce que je voulais dire. Je pense que nous sommes en ce de proc\u00e9der \u00e2 un vote pour savoir si oui ou non on do it faire l'examen de ce document i notre Comit\u00e9 financier. Je c' clair et bien compris ici et que la majorit\u00e9, plus ou HOYOS (Colombia): Apoyo plenamente lo que han dicho los representantes de F ilipinas y Congo. Quiero repetir lo que ya dije en la Plenaria, de que creo que sentarla un precedente grave con consecuencias imprevisibles si cada delegaci\u00f3n trajera aqu\u00ed a la FAO un documento en su propio idioma y la FAO despu\u00e9s lo reprodujera. Esto solamente para dar satisfacci\u00f3n a esa sola delegaci\u00f3n, por importante que sea y por obstrucionista. que sea su t\u00e1ctica. Sra. Dra. Grafila SOTO CARRERO (Cuba): En realidad mi delegaci\u00f3n se encuentra esta tarde aqu\u00ed en la sala para adoptar el informe final del 90\u00b0 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Consejo, sin embargo, nos sentimos totalmente confundidos al encontrar ahora en este debate nuevos textos que nos han presentado. Me parece que sobre la pregunta que usted ha dirigido a los delegados miembros del Consejo, ellos mismos se refirieron a este tema. Creo que es in\u00fatil volver a abrir el mismo. Para ser m\u00e1s breve, se\u00f1or Presidente, quisiera decirle que la delegaci\u00f3n de Cuba se adhiere a las intervenciones hechas por Congo, Filipinas y Colombia . David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I regret to have to intervene again but I just want to make one observation. My recollection is that when we had this debate there was a discussion, a very extensive one, on whether it was appropriate for this matter to go to the Finance Conmmittee and also whether the paper which the delegate for the U. K. puts out should have been circulated in the way it was. I have been trying to find the verbatim report, but I do not have it with me. It was my clear recollection, that in your summing up you said that this matter would be discussed further between the United Kingdom and the Secretariat and that the matter would be considered at a future meeting by the Finance Committee. Why can we not just reflect that and leave it there? Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): I think the proceedings on page 17 of document CL 90/PV/8. Unfortunately, I do not know many of the languages here including the beautiful language of the distinguished representative of Colombia, who keeps complaining that he does not know English. I would request that somebody should read this out and this will summarize the ruling, because there was a ruling made at that time by you. in consultation with the Council. I think we can start with this p age. V. J. SHAH (Directeur, Bureau du Programme du budget et de anglais, en espagnol, en chinois arabe. the Spanish, Mr Chairman (interruption in Spanish) I cannot read the Spanish of what the representative of Colombia said, but I can read what I said. I said that we are inclined to go along with t he recommendations of the representative of Colombia. We are impressed by the determination with which the United Kingdom representative wishes to place on record certain reservations regarding the overheads of FAO. I thought, right at the beginning , that you had taken a decision, Mr Chairman, that it was not to be a Conference document. I feel that rather than this matter be ing raised again and again under some other issue, or some other heading, it would be better to decide now as to how it should be dealt with. Secondly, in the Finance Committee, which has distinguished representatives including the representative of Australia, I think that various reservations, or opinions, could have been expressed and can again be expressed. This matter should be decided strictly according to ruling, rather than discussion on a matter that has already lasted too long. As the distinguished representative of the United States said, \"We are not just inclined to accept the recommendation of Colomb ia. We say for heaven's sake let's accept it and get on. We should have finished this long ago and we heartily endorse what the delegate said. \" Then the representative of the United Kingdom himself said, \"I am not pushing this further. If the interventions we make do not make sense without our paper we apologize\". Then you said, \"If the United Kingdom agrees with the proposal made by the delegate of Colombia, confirmed and supported by the delegate of the United States, we consider that that procedure has been opted for. Namely, that in its interventions the delegate of the United Kingdom will refer to all parts of the report which concern him. \" d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I am sorry for taking the floor so often. The passage we have just been looking at was on a different subject all together which was whether a paper which we had put round should be issued as a Conference Room paper. In view of the costs and other things and the general unpopularity I gave up this proposal. The proposal which we thought was carried, and is really in page 15 of CL 90/PV/8, was that we asked that the subject be taken up by the Finance Committee. I sai d that I would produce a paper which would be a different paper, a paper prepared after discussions with the secretariat. The Director-General then asked what it was to be called and your summary was on page 16 which was that \"if the Council is in agreement we can carry on now\". I understand this to be an agreement that should be taken to the Finance subject liquidity was discussed under item 12 and the relevant documentation is also on page 16, but is on CL 90/PV/16. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: The question is not really the fate of the paper submitted by the United Kingdom. The question is whether the Committee should consider Rules Procedure Finance Committee state that the Director-General, in consultation with the Chairman of the Committee, shall prepare a provisional agenda. Unless the Council wishes to be done otherwise the Director-General is quite ready to include, in the next regular session of Finan ce Committee, an agenda item entitled, discussion the Director-General will prepare a paper which will take account of the discussions with the United Kingdom, but it is the Director-General's prerogative to submit his own paper to the Finance Committee. He is not by any means obliged to submit the paper of the United Kingdom, therefore, I think that on that understanding we can proceed unless the Council does not wish this to be included in the agenda. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I have been getting increasingly perplexed I thought we had a clear understanding on this point. I gained this from reading the verbatim and, as the United Kingdom has pointed out, your own summing up, which was not disputed by anybody at the time and is quite clear. You said, \"I would like to separate the question into two parts\" I am reading this in English and I am very surprised that the Secretariat has not picked this up. \"The first qu estion posed by the representative of the United Kingdom for the Council was to know if it is possible for the Council to accept the principle of a study on the programme delivery costs, which will be presented to the Director-General of FAO by the United Kingdom, to form the basis of an analysis by the Finance Committee next spring. I think that is all that needs to be reflected. \" Mr President you went on to say, \"If the Council is in agreement we can continue. \" There remains a second question posed by the United Kingdom which was to do with whether their paper was to be considered appropriate in this context. I really thought that that had been decided by the Council, and I am very puzzled that we are even having this discussion. Le PRESIDENT. Nous sommes Just to clarify could you indicate what we have done. We have left the Draft as it is with the exception of the amendment proposed by the delegate of Turkey? There is no inclusion in this Draft of a reference to delive ry costs? Could you du Royaume-Uni a accept\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e sur deux points. En ce qui concerne les liquidit\u00e9s, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 pourrions adopter ce Mme la du a demand\u00e9 la parole, je la prie de m'excuser. Sra. Mercedes FERMIN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Ahora retiro la palabra porque yo iba a pedir un punto de orden; llevamos hora y media discutiendo un punto que no est\u00e1 en el Orden del D\u00eda ni en la agenda y yo iba a pedir un punto de orden para traer el deb ate a su puesto, pero no tuvo la gentileza de ver mi pancarta que hace veinte minutos la tengo puesta pidiendo la palabra. Yo le do y las gracias. Le PRESIDENT: Nous passons au paragraphe 22. Y-a-t-il des observations? George MUSGROVE (Canada): Yes, I just will make a comment on the paragraphs that we have concluded. Insofar as the matter of procedure seemed to have satisfied the delegate of the United Kingdom I shall not press for the changes but I do not think they adequately reflect the views that our delegation, amongst others, has suggested and I must say that I find it extrem ely unfortunate that it has taken an hour and a half when a suggestion had been made for a short sentence to be added to this Repor t. I made my remarks earlier about the desire of some delegates to censor or to exorcise from the Report the things with which they do not agree. I find it a most extraordinary thing and I would like also to refer to the remarks made by Deputy Director-General Walton. I think we have sufficient difficulty with the debate that we hold amongst us without debating with the Secretariat and we do welcome his contributions in matters of facts but I do not appreciate having to discuss or discourse with, or disagree with, the Secretriat or find they disagree with me either. With regard to the paragraph 22 I should like to propose the deletion of some words in that particular paragraph and in lar the phrase which begins, \"all member countries of the majority words could gratuitous and accurately reflect the sense of this Council. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Yo creo que por lo menos es c\u00ednico e irrespetuoso que los propios causantes de las demoras en los trabajos del Consejo traten de descargar su responsabilidad sobre los dem\u00e1s. La delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia respalda plenamente las actuaciones del se\u00f1or Walton; la Secretar\u00eda tiene un papel que est\u00e1 cumpliendo adecuadamente. En relaci\u00f3n con el p\u00e1rrafo 22 al que se refiri\u00f3 ya Canad\u00e1 me permito observar que estos p\u00e1rrafos fueron objeto de larga discusi \u00f3n en el Comit\u00e9 y que a partir del p\u00e1rrafo 23 aparece la opini\u00f3n de la minor\u00eda, de manera que, por favor, una vez m\u00e1s, no desequilibren el contenido del Informe. Le PRESIDENT: Nous avons des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, ont appuy\u00e9 la pr\u00e9servation de ce programme. Je ne sais pas quelle est exactement la modification que vou paragraph the support of all member countries\". Our country, of course, has had some differences of view with respect to the control of the management of that Programme but has no difficulty at all in supporting its concept. -548- Le PRESIDENT. Si je vous ai bien compris, votre proposition consiste \u00e1 dire que \"le Conseil \u00e1 Federal Republic of): I have to object to that. I would like to leave the text of the Drafting Committee as it is. Le PRESIDENT: Qui peut le plus peut le moins, par consequent gardons 22 comme adopt\u00e9. into I think it reflects the views of ourselv es and others. Into the middle of that paragraph, a new sentence \"They also mentioned the possibility of ng transferred to voluntary financing\". Le PRESIDENT: Est-ce que ce point Je pose la Royaume-Uni. R. PETTITT anybody else...? CARANDANG is true that this was mentioned but also there were other delegations like myself that said that these were all objections that had been raised before and that they should not be raised again at this point. Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n) Volvemos a lo mismo, es decir si se agrega un punto entonces se tiene que contemplar lo que los otros dijeron. El informe busc\u00f3 ahorrar a quien lo lea la necesidad de reprod ucir aqu\u00ed los verbatim en primer lugar; en segundo, cuando se habla de algunos miembros no necesariamente todos ellos se refirieron a ese punto, de ah\u00ed que tampoco ser\u00eda justo que en este p\u00e1rrafo se hiciera esa imputaci\u00f3n a esos \"algunos miembros\". El informe busca ser sencillo, elegante, preciso y sobre todo evocar el consenso; ese es el prop\u00f3sito de un informe y no reproducir verbat im. Vuelvo a solicitar a los miembros de este Consejo que entiendan el esp\u00edritu de un informe y no lleguen a que en cada p\u00e1rrafo se haga un enunciado y que en el siguiente cuando se habla de otros o de la mayor\u00eda se vuelva a hacer el enunciado contrario; vamo s a buscar la f\u00f3rmula elegante y de consenso en este Consejo. Es e fue el esp\u00edritu que estuvo en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y espero prevalezca tambi\u00e9n en este Consejo. Humberto CARRION (Nicaragua). Deseamos apoyar plenamente lo ya expresado por el Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Deseamos de nuevo reconocer la responsabilidad y la capacidad con la cual 41 dirigi\u00f3 los trabajos da...Comit\u00e9 qua, de nuavo, marace nuestro respeto y creo que as improcedente adem\u00e0e que un solo delegado en este Consejo aeti tratando de imponer un punto de vista minoritario en un informe que ya refleja loa puntos de vista de mayor\u00edas y minor\u00edas. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): In view of the fact that nobody else seems to have claimed authorship of this, this was intended to be a helpful suggestion and did in fact help another sister organization to overcome similar difficulties. I will r ely on reference in the Verbatim and withdraw the reference. I think the sentence reflect the spirit of the first sentence and and it I should like to propose the deletion of the last two words in that particular paragraph. We do not find resorting to the Working Capital Fund normal under any circumstances, and particularly not in this circumstance. Le PRESIDENT: En ce qui concerne la PASCARELLI (Italy): I do not understand. If we cut out this word does it mean that the Director-General has no right to draw nine million dollars if need be from the Working Capital F und? What is the Working Capital Fund used Should there be a shortfall in contributions as predicted, and here I go along with my colleague from Italy, that if you do not consider it necessary or norma l, still there should be some reference to the fact that the Director-General has certain rights which cannot be taken away. It mi ght be considered as normal. So it should be in English \"Should there be a shortfall in contributions as anticipated, resorting to the Working Capital Fund to the maximum of resources available therein may be considered in terms of the rules. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): I think I understand what the delegate of Canada is saying. I did pick up this point myself but I had a different solution to this. My solution was in paragraph 28. But the position is that several countries did make the po int that they regarded the use of the Working Capital Fund to meet shortfalls which were not likely to be made up, to be not normal at all. To deal with a delay in payment until October would be a normal use of the F und. Indeed we were rather fiercer in our comments earlier in the debate before we had heard the definitive news. We were saying that they should not be used for the Working Capital Fund for this purpose. I think most of us now would say that the Working Capital Fund could be used for this purpose now because we know there will be shortfall and a delay. So \"normal\" could well be left out and there would be no loss to this. My proposal-may I mention it now because it relates to this it is paragraph 28?-would be to add \"Any recourse to the Working Capital Fund should be made good in Autumn 1987 when the 1986 payment by the United States is now expected\". Le PRESIDENT: Nous sommes saisis d'une permettant contraintes de temps, lesquelles nous de texte pr\u00e8s. des observations? R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): My proposal s till stands, that there should be a sentence at the end which reads: \"Any recourse to the Working Capital Fund should be made good in the Autumn of 1987, when the 1986 payment of the United States is now expected. \" DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: The conditions governing the reimbursement of monies to the Working Capital F und are included in the Financial Regulations, which not even the Council has the power to change, only the Conference can change them. The provisions state: \"Advances made from the Working Capital expenditure under Financial Regulation General Fund as soon as feasible but in any case within the next financial period. \" That is the rule and that not even the Council, I am afraid, can change. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sr. Presidente, despu\u00e9s de la declaraci\u00f3n del Sr. Walton, creo, en realidad, Sr. Presidente, que est\u00e1 plenamente demostrada la forma poco seria como est\u00e1 procediendo una delegaci\u00f3n. Sinceramente queremos hacer un llamado, Sr. Presidente, para evitar que debamos ir subiendo en nue stras expresiones de condena de este sistema, de que por fav or nos dejen trabajar, que no nos molesten, que sean serios, que sean correctos, que respeten al representante del Gobierno sobera no, Sr. Presidente. LE PRESIDENT: Nous avons une information pr\u00e9cise de la part am satisfied with the legal interpretation. This, however, is the recording of the views of some Members on policy, and a point of view, which actually I must confess was not expressed at the time because the information which would have allowed us to express it was not available until the end of the meeting. Had we had that information I at least would have said that in my view the Working Capital Fund should only be used for the purposes of dealing with normal delays and the money which will be late from the USA, and the remaining $25 m illion If it is not wished to include this in the report, and in fairness I did not say this except now, I will rely upon it being on the record and retain the right to bring it forward again in future discussions. The other point is that the words \"to the extent possible\" I think are not appropriate, if this is supposed to represent the vi ews of a group of countries. The sentence should I need no correction, after what the delegate of the United Kingdom said. Let me get this poin t clear. I think proposals of the Working for $9 illion did take into consideration already we largest contributor. In other words, the shortfall anticipated for the end of 1987 was to be covered with $16. 5 m illion adjustment plus $9 million from the Working Capital F und. So it is impossible in any case in Autumn after the United States has paid its contribution for 1986 to revert to the Working Capital Fund. So it is in the power of the Director-General to reintegrate whatever it takes in the next biennium, not in the current biennium. -551- Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sr. Presidente, ya se ha llegado realmente al colmo de la situaci\u00f3n cuando esa propia delegaci\u00f3n reconoce que plantea una cosa que no dijo en el deba te. Pero lo que m\u00e0s nos preocupa es que nos ha amenazado con que m\u00e1s adelante va a plantear otro asunto. Para evitar esa actitud que se repite en cada una de las reuniones del Consejo, la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia propone formalmente que el 91 per\u00edodo de sesiones del Consejo se celebre en las Islas Malvinas porque as\u00ed, bajo la soberan\u00eda argentina, podremos evitarnos estos problemas. POINT OF ORDER POINT D'ORDRE PUNTO DE ORDEN John GLISTRUP (Denmark): I call for a point of order. I think our work is progressing very slowly. I would like you, Mr Chairman, to rule in which way we are going to work. Are we planning for a night session? Are we going to progress as we have been doing so far since this morning? In saying so I have just looked back on the reports, and all the discussions which we hav e had so far have not improved significantly the reports produced for us by the Drafting Committee. In addition I have to observe that most of the Members who have spoken in this Council during this process have been Members of the Drafting Committee. May I in saying so suggest and move a motion that we approve the rest of the report en bloc? Applause Applaudissements Aplausos LE PRESIDENT: avons qualifications on the of the adoption of the report. I would also not think totally because I suspect that the rest of the report is much less controversial than what we have gone through. My recommendation is that we go on as usual. David Lawrence COUTTS (Australia): I am not sure what the vote of acclamation actually counted for then, but I did assume that it meant that you had ruled that the Council accepted the report en bloc . Is that the situation or not? No? Right, so we are still debating the matter of whether we accept it or not. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I must admit I joined in the clapping, but with one or two minutes reflection I realise that this is more the product of despair than of reason. We are tired and we do not know what we are looki ng forward to, but I do not think we can treat our important work and dismiss it in this way. So I must oppose it. Horacio CARANDANG (Philippines): I thought that the delegate of Denmark had been supported by the great majority of the Council who clapped. I was one of those delegates who clapped, and I supported fully his proposal. In fact, Mr Chairman, you will notice that every time I spoke it was to defend the Draft. -552- Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Yo fui uno de los que no apla udi\u00f3 con la propuesta de Dinamarca, pero, despu\u00e9s de lo que dijo la Embajadora de los Estados Unidos, yo tambi\u00e9n reflexion\u00e9 y ahora s\u00ed lo aplaudo, es decir, de que lo aprobemos en bloque. Yo entiendo que hay una propuesta espec\u00edfica con dos pa\u00edses en contrario. Por lo tanto, usted puede someter a votaci\u00f3n si aprobamos este informe en bloque o no. LE PRESIDENT: Nous allons peut-\u00eatre trouver un compromis. Il y a, d'une part, le sentiment que la suite sera plus agr\u00e9able que le d\u00e9but. Un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 nous paragraphe faire nos tra enfreindre les r\u00e8gles de la d\u00e9ontologie qui veut que le Conseil de la FAO, \u00e0 ce niveau, lu le Cela vous convient-il? Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I fully agree with your proposal but I would like to give a response to my Danish colleague, and also if I may give some advice to the Chairman, that is that the members of the Drafting Committee may take the floor only to defend the Draft, as it was the case for me and for my colleague from the Philippines and many others. There was criticism from our Danish colleague that I do not accept. My interventions were only defending the draft and were not to change anything. So, members of the Drafting Committee, should not ask for the floor unless they have something to defend, and not to change. LE PRESIDENT: Compte tenu de ce que nous venons de dire, pouvons-nous adopter les paragraphes 28, 29, 30 et 31 du document CL 90/REP/2 ainsi que le projet du rapport Partie l'a annonc\u00e9 Repr\u00e9senta au de tr\u00e9sorerie qui sera distribu\u00e9 le 1er janvier 1987 en outre d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le versement de (India): We agree to that. However, I think in Rome we should mention the following slight changes government. its n\" \"for the announcement made during the debate by the representative of the host government that his government had agreed to delay. The rest of the paragraph is all right. I do not want to take up much time. To refer to it as a positive response to the current phase of budgetary constraints through which the Organization is passing, it is just a minor change, I could discuss it with th e Chairman of the Drafting Committee rather than put it to the Council. But, thanks to Italy for the positive response, could it be worded slightly differently, if you do not mind. Rainer PRESTIEN (Germany, Federal Republic of): This is not with regard to the proposal just made by our Indian colleague. We would prefer different wording in the second sentence of paragraph proposal would be to replace the words \"it recognized\" in the first part of this sentence by \"it noted\". Then in the second part of the sentence after the word \"and\" inse rt the wording \"the Director-General's view be necessary short-term borrowing tentative amount of US$30 m illion\" because in our view, if I may draw your attention to the speech that was given by the further delays receipts with no other alternative than to borrow a sum of around US$30 million to meet cash flow requirements. \" In the view of my delegation it was the Director-General who expressed his view and I think we should express that view in the report. -553- R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): by the necessary economies and noted the Conference had the responsibility conside r powers the of paragraph 33 \"It looked forward to receiving the view s of the Finance Committee at its next session, together with a report on action taken by the Director-General. \" This conforms with our views that the Director-General should have flexibility take delegation wishes to propose the addition of a sentence at the end of paragraph 33. I am not sure if the sentence is still pertinent with the amendments which have been made by the distinguished delegate of the United Kingdom, but we shall see. The sentence I would propose to Director-General's that should the gravity of the present financial situation be confirmed, it was open for the Finance Committee in December, and the Council in June 1987, economies. the lead in demonstrating its commitment to FAO at a time when the Organization finds itself trapped by financial difficulties. Therefore, the amendment suggested by the deleg ate of India that we should add the word \"deep\" before appreciation. Having said that, I should like to say that now Italy has set an example for others to follow, whether we could accept other countries in a similar situation expecting cash refunds to make similar gestures. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): After your decision that we will work in a more efficient manner by taking things en bloc , by subjects, it seems to me after two statements and two interventions by two delegations which have so far also made so many suggestions during our discussion that we are practically going back to the same situation that we were in a few moments ago. I have not got fully the texts of the proposed amendments by the distinguished representative of the united Kingdom and Canada but I have got the sense of them, and my delegation would not go along with such proposals. So I would appeal to them to cooperate constructively that we finish our work tonight. If they will not, then we can agree to continue. I have the permissio n of my government to stay un til next Tuesday to finalize this work. LE PRESIDENT: Si vous permettez, je signalerai y ce paragraphe, on dit que le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral consulterait accept\u00e9? Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Entre todo lo que usted ley\u00f3, se\u00f1or Presidente, alcanc\u00e9 s\u00f3lo a captar la propuesta para el p\u00e1rrafo 29 que es inaceptable para la delegaci\u00f3n de Colombia. Philippa PIOTET (France): Je me rifare i la derni\u00e8re le Comit\u00e9 financier. Je ne me souviens pas si on a parl\u00e9 de cela, mais j e le suppose, car sinon le Royaume-Uni ne l'\u00e9voquerait pas. Je me demande quel est le sens de cette formule. II y a des r\u00e9gies concernant les rapports entre le tte formule. -554- LE PRESIDENT: Voil\u00e0 la position de la France. lentement. George MUSGROVE (Canada): It was the addition of a sentence at the end of paragraph 33 Council noted the Director-General's assurance that gravity of the present financial situation be confirmed, it was open to the Financ ial Committee in December and the Council in June 1987 to propose further programme economies. \" Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Desear\u00eda que el se\u00f1or Walton nos confirmara si la propuesta de Canada corresponde en efecto a una declaraci\u00f3n del Director General. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I do not think that this addition would help. We have discussed repeatedly in the Finance Committee the powers of the Finance Committee, the Director-General and the Council. We came to the conclusion that none of them has the power to cut the programme, only Conference has that power. I do not think the addition will help us, only help us to waste tim e. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: I am afraid I cannot However, would refer back to paragraph 25 which has already been adopted by Council, which relates to the possibilit y of the financial situation deteriorating, or improving. I that the G. PETTITT I did make a suggestion for another sentence at the end of paragraph 29, but as this seems to have produced no response I will be content that it is recorded in the verbatim record. Quelle votre proposition? R. G. by the necessary economies and the Conference the consider whether powers of borrowing should still persist\". If this is not generally subscribed to, I will make it my own observation in the verbatim reco rd. Horacio CARANDANG (Philippines): wanted to that if the representative agrees that it be left in the verbatim record, so be it. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Si el Reino Unido ha dicho que quede en las actas, pues que quede pero que no haga m\u00e1s propuestas. LE PRESIDENT: C'est bien. Que propose le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Canada? -555- George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): The proposal I had made with respect to paragraph 33 has not been accepted by the Council, I take it. It is different from paragraph 25. I believe I recall the Director-General said that the views proposed by however, should they be proven correct it was open for the Finance Committee in December and in June to make further proposals for cuts. I took issue with the Director-General to some extent by saying that in June 1987 there would only be six months left in the biennium in which to effect economies, scarcely a length of time in which to show any great effect. As I recall it, that was the course of the discussion and it was what I wanted to refle ct in paragraph 33. However, if it is not the wish of Council to include those words, I withdraw. However, I do have some changes to make with respect to paragraphs 36 and 39, and as we are doing this in sections perhaps I can propose those as Paragraph believe the last two sentences should be deleted. They are non-attributed and I do n ot think they add anything to the particular reflection of the Council's deliberations. They seem to be assertions and I am not su re if they are a reflection of the discussion or simply assertions. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): As there has been a proposal to take the paragraphs en bloc I will also reply in the same manner. I think that the two sentences towards the end of paragraph 36 have the sense at least of opening up some prospective for the fut ure of the Organization. In this sense they are useful, and that is why I think it was right of the Drafting Committee to insert th em because they reflect the spirit, the sense, of our discussion. Therefore I support that text being left in. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Por ahora vamos a limitar nuestras observaciones a las propuestas que se han hecho sobre el p\u00e1rrafo 36. De una vez por todas debemos declarar que si interv enimos como miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, nunca ha sido para introducir elementos nuevos, sino para apoyar los acuerdos tomados en la sala donde trabajamos. El colega del Canad\u00e1 puede tener raz\u00f3n en cierto sentido en relaci\u00f3n con los t\u00e9rminos en que est\u00e1 redactada la pen\u00faltima frase del p\u00e1rrafo 36. Pero nosotros estamos de acuerdo con el colega Vujicic de Yugoslavia en el sentido de que es necesario mantener eso s conceptos y los proponemos ahora en sentido positivo as\u00ed: Las dos \u00faltimas frases dir\u00edan lo siguiente: \"A ese respecto, el Consejo reconoci\u00f3 la eficiencia de la gestion de la FAO y el ap oyo de que gozan sus objetivos y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que\". Luego se agrega la actual \u00faltima frase del p\u00e1rrafo 36. Esto lo dijimos en sentido positivo y creo que nadie pueda discutir que esta afirmaci\u00f3n corresponde a hechos. Mohammed ABDELHADI (Tunisie): Nous pensons que si le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction 36. LE par qui suivante: \"A le Conseil a reconnu l'efficacit\u00e9 ses to 36, aprobados -556- PARAGRAPHS 37 to 40 PARAGRAPHES 37 \u00e0 40 PARRAFOS 37 a 40 George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): In paragraph 39 there is the question of the options that would be considered by the Finance Committee. In this particular case we have recommended very strongly several other options to the Committee for their consideration. At the time of your summing up we attempted to make reference to those particular additional options, and severa l members objected that they should be included in your summing up but indicated that they would be reflected in the verbatim record and would find reflection in the draft report. I do not find them here. With that in mind, I would propose adding a sentence three lines down from the top of page 13 of the English text after the wor d \"options\". I shall read the sentence which included at this point: \"Some members felt of options to address uncertainty was incomplete insofar as it did not include standby measures to reduce programme spending when resources available to the Organization were inadequate. \" With the inclusion of that sentence in the paragraph, there would be a consequent change in the penultimate sentence of that paragraph where says \"decide which the options\". We suggest that that be changed to \"select to be studied further\". Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): On paragraph 39, no options are mentioned here. I remember that many delegations supported one or several options and spoke about the shortcomings and the benefits of some of them, but no statement by anybody has been reflected in this report. If we are now going to reflect all the positions taken, I would request that two options that I menti oned specifically be in and the others be forgotten. The fact that some delegations were of the opinion that some other possibilitie s and options should be considered is in the verbatim record, and when the Finance Committee is considering this matter they will tak e the verbatim record into account and not the report, because the report only covers the very general procedural manner on how i t will be done. Concerning the last proposal of the delegate of Canada, I can share that proposal and would s upport replacing the words decide \"selected a number of measures\" I think that is a better expression and I suppor t it. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: In order to avoid a drafting discussion on the points made by Canada and Yugoslavia, should like comma, and add the words \"and additional suggestions were put forward\". Then in the further down where it says \"the Finance Committee would decide which of the options should be studied further\", change that to \"would decide which the measures should be studied further\". I think that would meet all the points that were made. LE PRESIDENT: Pour le paragraphe 39, c'est donc en ordre, et je pense que M. le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction en a pris note.

LE PRESIDENT: Je remercie M. le President du Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction et passe la parole \u00e0 MM. les 1 \u00e0 5 sont approuv\u00e9s Los p\u00e1rrafos a 5 son aprobados Paragraph 6 approved Le paragraphe 6 est approuv\u00e9 El p\u00e1rrafo 6 es aprobado PARAGRAPHS 7 to 26 PARAGRAPHES 7 \u00e0 26 En ce qui concerne le paragraphe 18, j'esp\u00e8re que ne r\u00e9gime l'Afrique la FAO fasse tout ce amendments by the distinguished Ambassador of the Congo in paragraph 11. This is in accordance with the statement he made and which I echoed during our intervention. In addition to that I would like to suggest the addition of a few words in the first sentence. \"The of the Programme, which has become effective from May 1986\" and the rest of the sentence remains as it is here. LE PRESIDENT: Voulez-vous reprendre, quelle est votre proposition, M. (Panietan): After she inserted she words, \"which has become effective from May 1966. \" I hope this is now clear. Bernard LEDUN CL of would like to s upport Pakistan who mentioned a special programme for Africa which became effective in May 1986. I would like to add the words, \"and which has already mob ilized two-thirds of its $300 m illion in favour of the drought-affected countries (Zimbabwe): I would strongly s upport the amendment made by the distinguished representative of the Congo on item 18. I wish you to take note that Zimbabwe strongly supports that amendment. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Nosotros queremos expresar adem\u00e1s de nuestro respaldo total a lo que ha expresado la distinguida representaci\u00f3n del Congo, apoyado ahora por la distinguida representaci\u00f3n de Zimbabwe, que tambi\u00e9n lo hacemos teniendo en cuenta los mismos principios y las mismas opiniones que expresamos esta ma\u00f1ana para que aparezca claramente qu\u00e9 Estado es el que crea la desestabllizaci\u00f3n, porque eso lo conocemos todos, no es un problema de un Estado austral porque se ha insertado entre los Estados de la L\u00ednea del Frente, eso no nos dice nada. Creemos que con la proposici\u00f3n que ha hecho no nos di ce nada. Creemos que con la proposici\u00f3n que ha hecho la representaci\u00f3n del Congo se resuelve la situaci\u00f3n. R. G. PETTITT (United Kingdom): If the paragraph is amended in the way suggested I regret to say that the United Kingdom has to disassociate itself from this. I wish to have this recorded in the report. The new language is inappropriate for a technical body. Malikana Mike LISWANISO (Zambia): My delegation does not feel like reopening a debate on this particular issue. It was exhaustively debated this morning. The main point of a report is to reflect what was discussed and, so far as I am concerned, a nd I do recall which delegation participated in this particular debate, we did mention by name South Africa. Therefore, my proposal is that if the. NF countries find it difficult, to mention South Africa by name, they can enter these aversions and we can make progress. Joachim WINKEL (Gemany, Federal Republic of): As regards paragraph 11, I would like to support the proposals of the delegate of Pakistan and completed by the amendments of the United States. As regards paragraph 18 I cannot follow the new text which was proposed by Congo for the same reasons we had uttered in support of the United Kingdom when we were dealing with paragraph 21 of Rep. l. Guillermo Enrique GONZALEZ (Argentina): Brevemente, se or Presidente, para dejar constancia en acta del total respaldo de mi delegaci\u00f3n a la propuesta de modificacidn que hiciera la distinguida repreeentacidn del Congo al psrrafo 18. Elio PASCARELLI (Italy): I want to say that I support the proposal made by the delegate of Pakistan and with the add ition of the United States delegation concerning IFAD in paragraph 11 and for the same reason that prevented me from approving the change in the paragraph this morning in the similar words, I object to any change in paragraph 18 because of the economic and non- political nature of this Organization. Hra Millieant M. PENWILIK (United states of America): I only vane to say that I must repeat our government propos ition to the naming, to the political element in this Council and this would apply here in 21 and 18 and it is only for that reason, that po litics are being inserted here. Joseph TCHICAYA (Congo): Ea faisant ma proposition, je na m'attendair pas a ce que lee pays qui s ' y sont oppos\u00e9s ce matin changent d'avis. On traite d'economie et non de politique. Je ne sais pas ou est la frontiere entre les deu x. Quoi qu'il en soit, je note que ce forum politique. Il faut que cela soit clair. On nous dit que ce n'est pas ici le lieu approprie mais il s 'agit de subterfuges que pas accepter. Cela dit, nous prenons acte de l'attitude de ces pays vis-\u00e0-vis de l'Afrique S ud, elle est connue. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): No queremos dejar pasar la ocasi\u00f3n sin dejar constancia tambi\u00e9n en las actas de que nuestra posici\u00f3n es la misma que aquella que asumimos cuando adoptamos el p\u00e1rrafo 21 del REP/1; es decir, para Nicaragua es une cuesti\u00f3n de principio el reconocer en este Consejo que es el r\u00e9gimen de Africa del sur, Sur\u00e1frica, el que desestabiliza la producci\u00f3n agr\u00edcola y por tanto alimentaria a los pa\u00edses de la Linea del Frente. Por lo tanto, deseamos apoyar firmemente las d os propuestas hechas por el Congo. Mohammed ABDELHADI (Tunisie): A l'instar les du et du Pakistan. En ce qui concerne le paragraphe 18, ma d\u00e9l\u00e9gation (Brazil): debate but I cannot avoid registering in the Verbatim Records our support for the proposition made by the delegate of Congo regarding paragraph 18. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): I would like first to support the proposals made by the representatives of Pakistan and the United States on paragraph 11, and in paragraph 18 fully to support the proposal made by the representative of Congo and seconded by many countries, but one thing I cannot understand really, that some countries are claiming that this is a po litical matter and economical and agricultural matters, technical matters should not be mixed with politics. Then I would just like to put the que stion to those countries why the governments of the same countries apply economic measures to boycott against the racist regime of South Africa if' we have to divide these distinctions. Why governments in these countries take economic measures concerning a political matter. I think it is the right and duty of this Organization to take into account also the decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations and also the sense of the policies of the same governments which are speaking here about so-called po litical the Mirza KHALEELI (India): I think in the interests of quick working, just as important as the substance, this matter of paragraph 18 has already been gone into this morning. We do not want to make any more divisions or to politicise what is taking place. At the very least one has to mention the regime of South Africa. We have not condemned it. We should have condemned it. We should be condemning what they do. It is not a political matter. It is a factual matter that they are doing what no other re gime is doing. So I think it would be in the interests of the House if you just put it to the House as in paragraph 21, 90/REP/1, th at the proposition put forward by Congo and s upported by others that is put to the House. As for India, we supported it much earlier and we definitely support at the very least the naming of South Africa. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Disc\u00falpeme por una segunda intervenci\u00f3n en este punto, pero pens\u00e1bamos, con nuestro apoyo a la distinguida representaci\u00f3n del Congo y a otros que hablaron sobre la necesidad de volver a situar aqu\u00ed el nombre del pa\u00eds que desestablliza, que no iba a entrarae en la diecuai\u00f3n otra vez. Ahora noeotros s\u00ed queremos expresar que, el hay una res erva y si en le reserva s e habla de que hemos politizado la discusi\u00f3n, nosotros haremos une reserva rechazando el concepto de politizaci\u00f3n y queremos decir lo siguiente: Todos sabemos, Sr. Presidente, que las acciones pol\u00edticas producen efectos econ\u00f3micos; aqu\u00ed estamos en presencia de una acci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica que produce efectos econ\u00f3micos. Ahora, nosotros no estamos aqu\u00ed discutiendo la acci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica, estamos discutiendo los efectos econ\u00f3micos de esa pol\u00edtica y, precisamente, por eso queremos qu e aparezca sencillamente el nombre para poder ir discutiendo los efectos econ\u00f3micos. Entonces, que se desligue bien clarito la situaci\u00f3n, para que se nos quiera entonces parecer una reserva por politizaci\u00f3n, porque entonces tendr\u00edamos que hacer una reser va rechazando la politizaci\u00f3n, y para que conste en acta tambi\u00e9n. -560- LE PRESIDENT: \u00c2 la fin de ce d\u00e9bat, je qui a vu le jour en mai 1986 et qui a mob ilis\u00e9 deux tiers de ses objectifs pour actuel: \"qui a vu le jour en mai 1986 et qui a mob ilis\u00e9 deux tiers de ses objectifs\".

I think these are non-controversial. These are now very good indeed. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I wonder if in paragraph 10 we could mention something which was brought up over and over again and that is that we are particularly hopeful to encourage still further security assurance that the component will be paid to workers in public projects; the cash component, it is not wholly cash, it is half of the going wage for that kind of work in that country at that time, the other half in food. I think it is important to stress, because it was c ertainly done over and over, we welcome assurances that this will be continued and increase the cash component in the workers' wages for public roads and construction. At the paragraph 10 \"a for the excellent services provided to them for their food assistance. The assurance was welcomed that the cash component in the wages of workers on public projects est approuv\u00e9? Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Estamos plenamente de acuerdo con usted en que ha sido ya aprobado el REP/5. S\u00f3lo queremos llamar la atenci\u00f3n a nuestra distinguida secretarla del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n para que en el p\u00e1rrafo 14, en la parte fin al, adapte la redacci\u00f3n castellana a la inglesa. En ingl\u00e9s est\u00e1 bien, en castellano no corresponde. Es un asunto de fondo, pero est oy seguro de que esto se har\u00e1. RIGHT OF REPLY DROIT DE REPONSE DERECHO DE REPLICA M. Afzal QADIR I wanted the floor after amendments had been proposed and we reached the end of discussion on the subject. My purpose in asking for the floor is not to suggest any amendment in this document but to exercise my right of reply to a statement which was made by the delegate of Afghanistan when the Council was deliberating on item 7 dealing with the Annual Report of the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes of the UN/FAO Food Programme. This by the Afghan delegate contained in document CL 90/PV/13 was made at a time when I was not here. Had I been here I would have promptly asked for the floor for the exercise of the right of reply. The statement by the delegate abounds in to register protest reference strongest calls a great humanitarian effort under way in Pakistan to look after 3 m illion refugees who have been driven from their hearths and homes by a brutal regime in Afghanistan and for which the Government and the people of Pakistan have received The impugned am not going to quote his words-suggests that in order to get increased and expanded assistance we have been refugees. This assertion is unacceptable, the light of t he fact well known to every one of us here that there have been special and independent missions from the UN, WFP and UNHCR who have gone into details of the several times before, and, based on their assessments, the whole syste m of aid to Afghan refugees in Pakistan has evolved over the last 6 or 7 years . The Afghan delegate goes on to say that in the process inflating the bandits, mercenaries, and so on. I do not want to comment on this because I tre at this statement with the contempt it deserves. In order to dramatize the so-called programme that as offer, a large number of Afghans have returned to their homeland, but then a larger number still could have returned if artificial barriers and obstacles were not created by the Pakistani authorities. It is an insult to the intelligenc e of the Members of the Council for the Afghan delegate to say this and expect that his statement be accepted by this Council. It goes without saying that the brutal scorched-earth policy, the de-population policies through resort to indiscriminate bombi ng, has made even those refugees who were settled in Afghanistan flee into Pakistan, and this process the of countries carried refugees and this enumeration was conducted with the full knowledge of the donor countries and with the representatives of the UNHCR and WFP who are stationed in Pakistan. The enumeration showed that there were 2. 8 million refugees and that the trickle of refugees, or the flood of refuge es, I would say a trickle now, was continuing. We do not want to create any impediments to the return of the refugees to their homes. They have every right to go back to thei r homes, and we would like them to go back to their homes as soon as possible, which means when the conditions that originally caused them flee their homes have been removed or rectified. Apart from the human plight of the refugees themselves, they do not in Pakistan. Pakistan is a developing country itself. These refugees impose u pon us a tremendous economic, social and ecological burden, a burden which we have been bearing grounds with the assistance we would like to see an immediate end to the plight of the refugees, an immediate end to the conditions made The statement also talks about fraud, embezzlement, so on. I have just returned from a meeting with Mr Ingram, who returned from Pakistan about a week ago. I had a luncheon meeting with him. He tells me that he was so happy to see that the Pakistan authorities have been continuously improving the management of as well as the utilization of assistance provided i n this connection. Why should he make a statement like this? He could have kept quiet. We did not ask him for his opinion on how we were utilizing this. He made this statement when he was told by his staff officers in the field that Pakistan's record of utilization is as good as it could be, although there could be problems. We are looking after nearly three m illion refugees. There could be some leakages here and there. But to say embezzlement, fraud, leakages into unauthorized hands, is totally unacceptabl e to my government. The last word I would like to say with regard to the inflation of the number is, why should we inflate the number of refugees, because if we do this our share of contribution for the upkeep of the refugees goes up. So we have no reason to artificially in flate the number. What we do is and objectively assess the number from enumeration, because it does not help us to show that the refugees are 3 million or 4 million and so on. The statement also says that a great number of refugees their homes and villages. The Afghan authorities aided by another power should have been able monitor the number of returnees for the Afghan dalagadefee to have seven us a pratice figure or an approximate figure of the number of people who have returned or are in proeaes of returning on a day-to-day basis. Our report la that the refugees are coming in, given this scorehad earth policy to which X have referred being pursued by the Afghan authorities. Then they said refugees those seasonal migrant nomads. In peacetime le usual for the nomads to come to Pakistan and then go back. It defies imagination how in highly disturbed conditions, fighting is going on, how could one expect the seme flow of nomads bringing their cattle to move into Pakistan and go back untrammelled by fears of being attacked or decimated or destroyed? I really do not know. Having said this, I have now completed my right of reply. -563- I would like to commend the Chairman and the Members of Drafting Committee for not having included the statement of the Afghan delegate in the report, for which I am most grateful. LE PRESIDENT: Je crois que le Pakistan a une ne pas. a \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9e dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal, ce qu'a ainsi de suite. Il n'y a pas de raison pour que cela s'arr\u00eate. Mohammad Hasan PAIMAN (Afghanistan): For so long a time, he was asleep, the delegate of Pakistan, and now he has woken up. Secondly, today is the result of the Council, but it is not a time to speak out of the order of the Agenda. Thirdly, I want to define the facts, but I do not want to attack anybody in this way. The distinguished delegate of Pakistan is making the circumstances today. It is trying to change, it has been provoked by somebody or some forces, they are provoking them against Afghanistan. This is the real fact. Now we want to give some facts about Afghanistan. LE PRESIDENT: Je pense qu'on va arr\u00eater le soul\u00e8ve sa pancarte mais nous ne que l'on puisse continuer. Mohammad Hasan PAIMAN (Afghanistan): I do not want to take much time. I do not want to express much on politics but I fully agree whatever speech I have made in CL 90/9 on the WFP programme. My delegation has approved and Council has approved and no one has any objection except Pakistan, on this day only. Everything has been made clear. Everything is all right. The situation is all right in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. I do not mention that there are more than 130 m ilitary training camps, these are assessments from all the external organizations, they are giving to the Pakistan Government, they are sharing out by bandit s and they are training their militaries. . . POINT OF ORDER POINT D'ORDRE PUNTO DE ORDEN John GLISTRUP (Denmark): We are here to approve reports of the Council. We have had our discussions and we have had our deliberations. May I request you, Mr Chairman, to stop further debates and revert to the matter of clearing our reports.

I think that we should say that. \"...done by the External Auditor in revi ew of sectors in the Regular Programme and in the audited accounts of all programmes, that all moneys were accounted be into account, except that basically the Council was dealing with the Report of the Finance Committee and here we are going directly to the External Auditor and giving the External Auditor a greater importance than the Report of the Finance Committee. In a way, we are introducing in our comments on the External Auditor's report things that we did not express regarding the Finance Committee. Therefore, the point made by the delegate of the United States needs to be accepted, that the External Auditor's report has bee n made with absolutely no qualifications, and everything has been gone into thoroughly by the Finance Committee which has considered the clarifications given by FAO and, after being satisfied, has recommended the adoption of the accounts to be forwarded to the Council along with the draft resolution. So if we are to admit the Canadian corrections we should have somethi ng to say that the External Auditor has made no qualifications whatsoever in his comments; otherwise it sided. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Apoyamos plenamente lo que han dicho los Embajadores de Estados Unidos y de India. Sobre la segunda parte de la propuesta de Canad\u00e1 en relaci\u00f3n con los sistemas de planificaci\u00f3n y seguimiento presupuestarios, d e manera muy cordial nos permitimos llamar la atenci\u00f3n de nuestro vecino el colega Musgrove en el sentido que aparece en la primera frase del p\u00e1rrafo 8, en la primera frase del p\u00e1rrafo 8. \u00b7 En relaci\u00f3n con la adici\u00f3n que se propone al final del p\u00e1rrafo 9, volvemos a la misma situaci\u00f3n. Estoy un poco cansado pero todav\u00eda mi mano escribe; si se insiste en incluir la expresi\u00f3n de alguna delegaci\u00f3n ya yo tengo redactado el texto de la posici \u00f3n de las otras delegaciones, de manera que es mejor evitar esto y adoptar el p\u00e1rrafo 9 tal como est\u00e1. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): On this point I would say three things. The first is that I understand the arguments put forward by the delegate of India, but originally this was going to be two separate items, the Finance Committee's report and th e financial statements. They were run together as one single item to save time. In those circumstances, I think it is quite reaso nable to have comments on the External report in the form they are. Secondly, I should like to say that we support all the amendments proposed by the Canadian delegation. We certainly consider reflect our views reflect the views of a Nations that we heard. Finally, we would also say that we have a particular interest in this because you will be aware from yesterday's w hich are clearly recorded in the verbatim PV/16 on page 16, that we have a number of unanswered questions on these issues which, with your agreement, we are pursuing with the Secretariat and, again with your agreement, are sharing with the Finance Committee. So we have an interest in seeing the text as amended nous nous demandons du Il sage de ce en l'\u00e9tat. Danilo VUJICIC (Yugoslavia): I may be repeating in English what was just said by the delegate of France, but I would like to sa y that I support the amendment proposed by the United States to paragraph 5. I also share the assessment of the delegate of India on the proposal of paragraph 5 that we give too much attention to the report of the External Auditor. Even such language as propos ed by Canada may encourage the External Auditor to involve himself in the policy-making of FAO, not only following the right procedures and so on. I would not go along that line. In paragraph 8 I could accept only one word proposed by Canada, that is to replace the word \"noted\" by \"urged\", but not the addition at the end of the sentence, so that this read would appeal to delegations to go back to the original text as proposed by the Drafting Committee. I believe the thoughts that are being expressed here now do not really add very much to the draft that is already be fore us. When we say that the work of the Auditor is useful work-well, if he was not doing useful work we would not hire him anyway. We have already said that the Council had expressed an unqualified audit opinion on the financial statements and the latest schedules; in other words, there was really no problem; this was in accordance with accepted auditing principles. That is also the same thought that was being expressed by the United States delegate, although her statement really brings out that point. With regard to the amendment to paragraph 9, I am afraid that if delegations say that they made this comment, then there will b e counter-comment, precisely the text. M. FENWICK (United States of America): I would like Drafting has been very balanced in everything, and if paragraphs 5 to 12 are read together it makes a very cohesive pattern, plus, of course, some amendments which have been suggested by the United States delegate, but in the last sentence of paragraph 11 there \\is reference to the External Auditor's comments regarding the development of the WFP Information System and the circumstances leading to the abandonment of the initial quite rightly passed it because the Finance Committee had seen it and passed it over. Why are we concentrating so much on a few things of FAO without dealing with this? Therefore, I would strongly urge that the draft as by our most capable Chairman of the Drafting in the interests of everyone and would save a lot of time. Any other amendments would lead to tremendous Millicent of America): I think it would be wise to add at the end of paragraph 11 \". \u00b7\u00b7 also note d the the delegate of Canada as regards paragraphs, that le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 l'Inde, de is that we should retain the entire thing as it is, with the small amendment suggested in paragraph 8\u00b7 If that is not acceptable and the delegate of Canada and others insist on propositions, addition to 11: \"In connection with the development of the WFP Information System and the circumstances leading to losses and abandonment of the initial contract the Council urged that corrective action be taken and the programme for the development of the WFP Information System accelerated according to the course my first preference is neither to have this nor that, but a slight change in paragraph 8, as summarized by my distinguished neighbour, the representative of the Federal Republic of Germany. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): El curso del debate nos est\u00e1 demostrando que no es sano ni constructivo proceder de esta manera; debemos evitar la proliferaci\u00f3n de propuestas en uno y otro sentido. Apoyamos firmemente, y pedimos al Consejo lo apoye, la propuesta del Embajador de India en el sentido de aceptar una sola modificaci\u00f3n en el p\u00e1rrafo 8 en vez de \"tom\u00f3 nota\", \"insto\" y aprobar todo este REP. Por favor, esta es una actitud sensata y equilibrada que todos deben apoyar. LE PRESIDENT: Il y a une proposition concr\u00e8te: c'est que l'on paragraphe 8, de donner lecture de ce texte. Est-ce-que, sur le plan du principe, pour ne pas multiplier les ajouts, le Conseil accepterait cela? James Kingdom): second more detailed amendment, proposed by the distinguished of India, acceptable to us. We think that that the amendment in paragraph 9 are quite complimentary, in the sense of their meaning, and add to the quality of the reports. We are very happy to accept this proposal and the Canadian proposal on paragraph 9. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Sr. Presidente, solo para ir clarificando el debate. La propuesta de Canad\u00e1 en el p\u00e1rrafo 9, que se refiere a licitaciones y otras cosas, no tiene nada que ver con la propuesta de India sobre el p\u00e1rrafo 11. Nosotros hemo s dicho que, si se acepta la propuesta de Canad\u00e1 en el p\u00e1rrafo 9, tenemos ya redactado el texto de la gran mayor\u00eda de las delegaciones que no podemos aceptar esa referencia al proceso de licitaciones. Por todo ello, Sr. Presidente, una vez m\u00e1s urgim os al Consejo a que acepte esto, a la luz de la propuesta de la India. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): I am not very experienced in these meetings and my memory sometimes fails me. I believe that it was the feeling of the meeting sometime ago that members of the Drafting Committee should only intervene to defend the draft. I believe that the distinguished delegate behind me is a member of the Drafting Committee. I also believe that what he said was not to dotond the draft, but that he was going to add an additional text i would be grateful for a ruling from you, Mr Chairman, of this point. I realise there la a point where an additional text helps to defend the draft, but it seems to me that we could use some guidance on this, otherwise we could get into difficulties Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Dicen que los p\u00e1jaros les tiran a las escopetas. Si yo acept\u00e9 en el comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n el p\u00e1rrafo 9 tal como est\u00e1 y Canad\u00e1 lo modifica en un sentido contrario a mi posici\u00f3n, pues es obvio que yo tenga que reaccionar; creo que esto es claro, Sr. Presidente, y eso -569- es lo que estoy haciendo. Pero, como lo dije antes, mil veces prefiero la propuesta de India, que mantiene el texto tal como es t\u00e1. Yo soy correcto, Sr. Presidente. Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Yo quiero constatar aqu\u00ed, Sr. Presidente, que ya, en varias ocasiones, les hemos dado la vuelta a las discusiones y hemos llegado a la misma conclusi\u00f3n, es decir, que los te xtos del informe reflejan un equilibrio muy delicado. Hemos debatido a veces una hora, una hora y media, y despu\u00e9s volvemos a aceptar el texto, y es que el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n-y lo afirmo con toda responsabilidad-hizo un trabajo muy responsable de equilibrio para evitar precisamente que este tipo de discusiones se dieran. Sr. Presidente, usted est\u00e1 viendo que, cuando se ro mpe este equilibrio, necesariamente todos los delegados que pudieron haber expresado durante los trabajos de este Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n sus propias opiniones tienen que volverlas a plantear. Yo recuerdo aqu\u00ed que se est\u00e1n discutiendo cosas que ya vimos e n el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, inclusive por parte de los miembros que del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n expusieron estas razones, y se concluy\u00f3, despu\u00e9s de mucho trabajo, que el texto, como les hemos propuesto, era equilibrado. Otra vez estamos volviendo a discutir lo que ya se ha planteado en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Yo lo recuerdo perfectamente bien, s e tuvieron este tipo de discusiones y les pido a los Miembros de este Consejo a trav\u00e9s de ustedes, que lean la totalidad de los p\u00e1rrafos, que vean que hay una armon\u00eda entre ellos, una relaci\u00f3n entre las distintas posiciones y que ciertas cosas de detalle se omitieron por razones obvias, porque no se pod\u00edan considerar las de unos miembros y las de otros no; es tan sencillo, pero yo s \u00ed quiero dar fe y les quiero agradecer a todos los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n su actitud responsable durante los debates qu e hemos tenido en el d\u00eda de hoy. S\u00e9 que ellos han defendido con mucha integridad este informe. Yo lo unico que puedo proponer es que se adopte esta parte del como hab\u00eda sido propuesta por el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, quiz\u00e1s con la mejora que hab\u00eda suscrito la delegaci\u00f3n de la India y algunas otras. Esa es la propuesta del Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de que he constatado que se est\u00e1 realizando el mismo tipo de debate que all\u00e1, en la sala de Malasia, tuvimos. LE PRESIDENT: La proposition du Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de amener Comit\u00e9 r\u00e9daction. Je pense, comme lui, que c'est la seule solution et que cette proposition est juste, compte t enu du souci constant que nous avons manifest\u00e9 pour maintenir, tant que faire se peut, un texte \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Je ne pense pas que la dans laquelle no aboutisse de satisfaisant. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): Balance like beauty is in the eye of the beholder. There was a fairly extensive discussion of the audited accounts in the balance of views reflected in the Drafting Committee did not reflect those who were active in that particular discussion. We have made three modest amendments here. I might add that invariably whenever we do have an amendment it is always the same three or four speakers who oppose it. I suppose that if I said it was a nice evening th e same three would fully oppose that as well. In paragraph 5 we have attempted to Introduce an element of consistency which is inherent throughout this report, the reports o f the Programme Committee, the reports of the Finance Committee and the reports of virtually every other committee. When a document has been presented by the Director-General and the Secretariat, is heartily endorsed, welcomed and adoration is heaped on it from every point of view. We have here the audited accounts 12. 2 in that discussion. The Auditor Cenerai, in addition to his purview of the accounts of the Regular Programme, is undertaking what we feel is an extremely useful and valuable exercise on behalf of the Organization, is periodic reviews of different sectors of the programme in its operations. I think Mr Crowth er had explained to us that that is what is called a \"value-for-money-type\" exercise. I take it from the expressions we have heard here that this particular work by the auditor is not appreciated by a number of members. We for one appreciate it and we thought that that appreciation would be shared by the members of the Council. We simply wanted to put something in there welcoming his work in this regard and giving him some encouragement to continue it. That was the basis for the amendment that went into paragraph 5. the Council therefore the welcoming process is something that we have thought would be due there. It is not to be confused with the Council's approval of the unqualified audit opinion which is found in the first sentence, so I do not think any amendment to my amended sentence that I am adding is appropriate from that regard. With respect to paragraph 8, I wondered if the Council should not also agree that it is of value to the Organization to institute improvements in the PLANSYS system. We have noted, of course, the Secretariat's regard for the costs which in such en exercise and other considerations. Nevertheless, it is an urging, by us the managers of the Organization, to impleme nt such changes as may be possible in line with the resources which are available to us. We think it is moderate and I cannot understand people being against that. This is something we expressed invaluably in the Council debate. It did not find reflecti on in the report. We were not on the Drafting Committee. Finally, with regard to the third one, in number 9, I think there is still concern felt on the part of a number of the delegati ons that the tendering process in the procurement of the word processing equipment was not quite in line with that which we experienced in a number of our own countries. Perhaps, as the auditor has pointed out, it might be the subject of some Improvement in the future. I just wanted to speak of those three amendments and commend them to the Council, and to stick with them. I think that the considerable work which our delegation has put into this Council meeting is grossly unrepresented in this report. I have ma de a number of suggested amendments during the day, most of those have been disregarded. I really would ask for some tolerance from my colleagues to take another look at those and see that they are not aimed at being devious or trying to obtain are a reasonable representation of the discussions of the Council. After all, that is what the rep ort is. It is not a question of whether people entirely agree with each other. It is a reflection of what was said in the Council. Horacio CARANDANG (Philippines): I would like to speak of the amendment of paragraph 9. It is said here that some delegations were concerned that the tendering process was not fully in compliance with the-it seems there is an innuendo here t hat the rules have been violated because the debates were not made on the same basis. Of course, this was said, but I don't know if we should put something like this in the report. It was also pointed out that the auditor had made it very clear that no violation had been made of any of the rules under the tendering process. If this is so, I was wondering whether we should put it so negativel y. delegation insisted on this amendment I be placed immediately after that. In other words, that it was pointed out by the auditor that no violation had been made of any rules under the tendering procedure. Waliur RAHMAN (Bangladesh): I am looking at the face of our Chairman of the Drafting Committee. I think he has made an impassioned appeal to us not to make any change in substance at this stage of our deliberations. The reason why the members of the Drafting Committee, at least my own delegation, we refrain from taking active part in the debate, except for one or two min or interventions, it is. very simple. It is not because of any ruling or rule in the Regulations, it is just a matter of courtesy, that we want other members to have a look at it and participate, but then, having said this, I would like to draw the attention of memb ers, particularly those members who have insubstantive amendments to say that in the similar vein of the views expressed by our colleague from the Philippines, we have our own preoccupations too. In this morning's deliberation I had a small amendment which I made, having made it I withdrew, for the sake of our solidarity and unanimity. To my government it had a very special meaning. I did not insist on that. I am repeating what the Chairman of the Finance Committee has said in a very clear and a ver y reasonable manner, that we should get on with our work and adopt this particular Report. Perhaps again, I did say perhaps, that the only mention which has been made, keeping in view all the paragraphs from 5 to 11, that is at paragraph 11, but this I am only saying as a matter of helping you to accelerate the work, if it helps, but that really, to my mind, takes care of some of the preoccupations of our friends but left to me, I think we should get back to the drafts as they are in the Report. Igor KIPMAN (Brazil): I have two very brief remarks. The first is to say that my delegation strongly supports the propos ition put the Drafting Committee, that would be to adopt this part of the Report without any modification. The second remark is to support the right of any member of the Drafting Comm ittee to propose additions have proposed to any paragraph to this Report which modifies the central idea. -571- James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): I have a point on three things here. First of all I recall that when the representative for Bangladesh withdrew his remarks, one of the qualifying facts was that he was a member of the Drafting Committee. Secondly, when you referred my query for advice to the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, I heard him say that we should leave the text as it was because it was a consensus. Fine. Then I heard him say that we should then accept the short amendment proposed by the delegate of India. I find this perplexing. One looks advice perhaps in conflict. If gold rusts, what shall iron do? So it is for this reason that I should like to make it clear. I can a ccept the whole of the amendment proposed by India, also the additions proposed by the United States, and turn now to the comments made by Philippines, supported by Bangladesh. I think if you can turn to the Auditor's Report you w ill find that the Auditor does not comment on the tendering procedure other than to say that there was effectively a lack of competition. Now the remarks about th e proprietory of the tendering procedure came from the Secretariat. Now we would be very happy to accept the amendments of the Philippines if it is quite clear that the text he is suggesting are the comments of the Secretariat, not the Auditor. I see Mr Crowther nodding. We come back to all these amendments. We are happy with them. We are particularly happy with the amendment proposed by Canada. This has been a very helpful discussion because we feel at the end of the day there is a very much better text than we already had at the end of the Drafting de r\u00e9daction. Je crois que C'est pour que pense, en dehors propositions avancer, il y aura des propositions et de s contre-propositions, et je ne pense pas que cela soit utile de a de laisser en l'\u00e9tat le texte du rapport? Tout sachant que les proc\u00e8s-verbaux font le d\u00e9tail appr\u00e9ciations la question aux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s du Conseil. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): We would very much like to help you with this because we realise it is getting late, but because this is a financial matter we do not think it would really be appropriate to follow the course that you have recommende d, and we think there is a simple and easy way which is enshrined in the Basic Texts . I would refer you to the notes in paragraph 2 of Rule VI, about the statement on minority views. Now, we can accept the views on a number of items were minority views but they were nevertheless expressed, so we are happy to see all the statements remain in the text simply on the basis that they are statements of minority views. I think it solves the problem, if you agree. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Quisiera creer en la sinceridad en ta vez de nuestro colega del Reino Unido y le proponemos lo siguiente Que al pie de p\u00e1gina de esta parte del informe se haga un llamado diciendo: \"La delegaci\u00f3n del Reino Unido no comparti\u00f3 este texto y expres\u00f3 su punto de vista que aparace en las actas correspondientes\" y asi puede ayudarnos a qu e el informe no sea tan extenso. Que por favor acepte este procedimiento. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): I would very much like to help this Council and it is for this reason that I will explain tha t we wish to retain a statement of minority view because we think in the circumstances, there are circumstances where one uses a technique of a reservation and we do not -572- think a technique is would both the technique and the reservati ons and also the status of minority views. So in these circumstances our position remains the same. Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Si se pone la opinion de la minor\u00eda, habr\u00e1 que poner la opinion de la mayor\u00eda. Yo creo que ha llegado el momento de que usted pida al Consejo qu\u00e9 quiere y que la mayor\u00eda de los\\ miembros expresen bl se inclinan por la propuesta del Reino Unido, o se acepta el Sistema. Yo creo que esto es aceptable y satisfactorio para el Reino Unido. El puede decir algo m\u00e1s todav\u00eda: la delegaci\u00f3n del Reino Unido expreso reservas t\u00e9cnicas que constan en las Actas y por tanto no compart e el texto de esta parte del informe. Se\u00f1or Presidente, esto es amplio, esto es suficiente, por favor que nos evite tener que agregar la opini\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda, que y a Congo y Colombia las tenemos redactadas y presentadas. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): I am sorry to have to return on this point, and also I would regret having to suggest that my colleague to the rear may be a little o ff-centre in his comments here. I do not think it is up to Council to decide this because what I am talking about is something which is in the Basic Texts and we are exercising something for which there is no opportunity for this Council to make a decision. We are exercising our right to have a minority view. Furthermore, I would also say that there is no right for this Council to attempt to stop any member having a footnote or a reservation so I am afraid I do not understand t he thrust of the intervention by the delegate from Colombia. I would be very grateful if you would clarify the position for me and assure me my reading is correct. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Realmente en estos momentos estoy mirando un partido de ping-pong: Colombia-Reino Unido. Ya me duele el cuello. Creo que debe usted se\u00f1or Presidente tomar la bolita y suspender la bolita, as\u00ed se acabar\u00e1 el par tido, y decidir qu\u00e9 hacemos, porque estos dos colegas, capacitad\u00edsimos los dos, nos pueden tener aqu\u00ed hasta las tres de la ma\u00f1ana con la bolita esa. LE PRESIDENT: Le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de on qu'un le texte r\u00e9solutions etc. minorit\u00e9. trouver une forme succincte pour ne pas avoir un texte trop lourd et dans lequel on pourrait ceci: \"Certains d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, un nombre restreint de Le Pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 accepterait-il forme en de l'opinion de la minorit\u00e9? Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Reconozco, y el Comit\u00e9 lo sabia, y reconoci\u00f3 en el texto que ustedes ven, que est\u00e1 plasmada aqu\u00ed, la opini\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda cuando el Comit\u00e9 pens\u00f3 qu\u00e9. era conveniente expresarlo a fin de no complicar demasiado el texto. Si bien dice este art\u00edculo. 6 que se debe expresar la opini\u00f3n de la minor\u00ed a, no niega el derecho a la minor\u00eda a poner un p\u00e1rrafo en consecuencia. Lo que estoy diciendo es que si la minor\u00eda va a pedir tal cos a se va a complicar el texto. El proyecto de informe era sencillo y buscaba claridad. Solamente llama la atenci\u00f3n para que se tome en cuenta. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom) Again I think there Is a way round this draft. I have not spoken to my Canadian colleague about this but might it not be in relation paragraph une observation? Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): No s\u00e9 de qu\u00e9 tomaron notas esos miembros, se\u00f1or Presidente; no s\u00e9 de qu\u00e9 van a tomar notas, pero lo cierto es que si esos miembros van a incluir en el informe aspectos -573- espec\u00edficos, que no aparezcan ahora como opini\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda. Es nuestro derecho reflejar esa opinion. Yo creo qu Cuba le ha dado a usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, una pauta de que detenga la bolita y pregunte al Consejo si prefiere una u otra opci\u00f3n. Son muy claras las dos. LE PRESIDENT: Je crois qu'il Il faudra faire \u00e9tat de l'opinion de la majorit\u00e9 du la certain e de d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s qui ont fait part de leurs points de vue. Il faudrait faire mention des deux de cette of America): I think I understood the delegate of the United Kingdom correctly to say that he would be satisfied with the wording used in paragraph 10, which is simply to say that in all these cases the Council ag reed with the External Auditor's suggestions for improvement and noted that the implementing these recommendations. Did you say you thought was fine? LE Est-ce que la minorit\u00e9 pour avoir un rappor t complet? POINT OF ORDER POINT D'ORDRE PUNTO DE ORDEN Sra. Mercedes FERM\u00cdN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Yo he estado escuch ando pacientemente en este juego de ping-pong, especie de obra de aficionados en que se ha convertido este Consejo. Me he estado absteniendo, pero aqu\u00ed no cabe otra cosa que un punto de orden. Voy a poner una moci\u00f3n de orden para que cese este debate y para que el Presidente someta esto a decisi\u00f3n y el Consejo decida. lo que tiene que poner en el informe. Qui\u00e9nes est\u00e1n de acuerdo con la moci\u00f3n que trae la redacci\u00f3n del Comit\u00e9 y que la mayor\u00eda decida. Me excuso, pero la verdad es que llevamos m\u00e1s de media hora con esto. Donat CHINKUMO (Cameroun): Nous nous le permettait, il y aurait lieu d'envoyer en mission un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume-Uni et un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la Colombie. Ils nous apporteraien avons eu r\u00e9sultat positif. LE PRESIDENT: IL y a deux hypoth\u00e8ses. Ou bien on \u00e9met l'opinion de la majorit\u00e9 et de la minorit\u00e9, et cela impliquera un travail assez long et compliqu\u00e9, et je le regretterai pour ma part, ou on demandera au Conseil de s'exprimer par vote, mais ce serait dommage. Leopoldo ARIZA HIDALGO (Cuba): Con todo respeto quiero recordar, se\u00f1or Presidente, que hay un punto de orden en la mesa propuesto por la delegaci\u00f3n de Venezuela y los reglamentos dicen que usted debe resolver y no entrar a discutir hasta que no se resuelva ese punto de orden. LE PRESIDENT Il y a une motion, d'ordre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Veneauela. absolument continuer faire un effort de plus pour ne pas avoir une tradition de vote que je quelque quelles suivre textes. Je qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e. \u00b7 Nous devons nous prononcer avant de poursuivre. peut le la que it to be clarified what we are voting about. LE PRESIDENT: Madame la d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e du I understand that the proposal is either to adopt the text as it is now proposed or to adopt the text with the amendments proposed by the United Kingdom, with the other views that would be put after that? I want it to be clarified. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): If I could take up the offer from the delegate of the Philippines and attempt. to clarify, th e position, as I understand it, is that we are debating a point of order. The text before us had amendments proposed by Canada, India, United States, Philippines and Bangladesh. The position that we had reached was we had said that we could accept all the amendments as they were proposed except in the case of the ones for th e Philippines and Bangladesh, where we said the comments came from the Secretariat rather than the Auditor. We would also suggest that the wording of the Canadian amendment in paragraph 9 makes it clear that is a minority view. So there is no need for a separate paragraph. It is quite straight-forward. It is clear that it is a minority view, and because of that it should not cause any difficulties. LE PRESIDENT: Je regrette mais 11 y a une motion d'ordre actuellement. Sra. Mercedes FERM\u00cdN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Me excuso con todo respeto y debo decir lo siguiente: en primer lugar, que una moci\u00f3n de orden no se debate; en segundo lugar, que lo que vamos a someter a votaci\u00f3n tiene que ser primero la proposici\u00f3n con las modificaciones; segundo, el texto. Votar\u00e1n los que est\u00e9n por las modificaciones y luego se votar\u00e1 el texto y a ll\u00ed votaremos la mayor\u00eda que estemos por el texto sin modificaci\u00f3n. Primero las modificaciones y luego el texto come est\u00e1; ese es el orden parlamentario, se\u00f1or Presidente, Si lo vamos a seguir. -575- LE PRESIDENT: Cela concerne le texte initial plus I think the delegate of Venezuela has now made the issue that she wants to put to the vote clearly. She has said that, as is very often done in Parliamentary procedure, there is a text and there are a number of amendments to the text. You start voting on the amendments and they are either accepted or rejected, and you end up with the final text as a result of the voting. You can handle it in one or two ways. You can either-and I think this is what the delegate of Venezuela suggested-take all the amendments as a package and if those are not accepted, then you are left with the original text; or else you can vote on the va rious amendments which have been proposed one by one. If anybody proposes the latter procedure, it is a procedure which could be perfectly feasible. Of course, if the Council takes the amendments one by one, some of them may be interdependent, but that is a matter which the Council will have to judge when voting on them in a series of votes. LE PRESIDENT: Nous passons au globalit\u00e9. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Es sobre este punto de orden que nosotros, obviamente, apoyamos; tal vez podemos ayudar a la situaci\u00f3n. El punto de orden presentado por la Embajadora de Venezuela se refiere pr\u00e1cticamente a que si continuamos debatiendo los textos que tenemos o si en realidad vamos a adoptarlo tal como lo presenta el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. liemos escuchado una serie de intervenciones, incluyendo una del Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n en donde se explicaba el trabajo de equilibrio y las discusiones largas para presentar el texto equilibrado. Por lo tanto, incluso despu\u00e9s de escuchar al Asesor Jur\u00eddico me parece a m\u00ed, esto lo puede aclarar la Embajadora de Venezuela, seg\u00fan interpreto vamos a votar primero a ver si deseamos que haya modificaciones, y creo yo interpretar que vamos \u00e0 votar la mayor\u00eda que no deseamos modificaciones porque confiamos en el trabajo del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Por lo tanto, digamos, mi interpretaci\u00f3n es que vamos a entrar si deseamos que haya modificaciones, y estoy seguro que habr\u00e1 votos minoritarios o, si queremos el texto tal como ha sido equilibrado. Motion carried on a show of hands La proposition est adopt\u00e9e par un vote \u00e1 main levee Se adopt\u00f3 la propuesta por votaci\u00f3n a mano alzada LE PRESIDENT: Les explications de M. le M. le Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, voulez-vous nous donner ce que pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 de r\u00e9daction: 30 voix. Le texte propos\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 availed itself of voting to adopt the text of the draft that we have before us, I should like your indulgence to enter a footnote to the section on adequately reflect the discussion on the audited accounts views in particular\u00b7\" Sra. Margarita LIZARRAGA (M\u00e9xico): Mi delegaci\u00f3n quiere deplorar el que en el voto expresado por el texto sin cambios una delegaci\u00f3n que formaba parte del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n y que estuvo de acuerdo con el delicado equilibrio haya votado en contra. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): I would like to associate my delegation with the reservation made by the delegation of Canada and ask that this be recorded in the report. Victor HJORT (Denmark): The delegation of Denmark would like to add its name to the footnote entered by the delegation of Canada. LE avait beaucoup d'amendements. Ceux du 5, du 8, du 9, et du 11. Comme l'a dit M. le Conseiller qu'il r\u00e9dig\u00e9 avec les remarques par du Canada, M. le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Royaume- Uni le d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Danemark. Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): We are going back again in a disguised form to the same thing. First we have a decision that we should avoid reference to this matter while the sovereign right to each country and each delegation to have its say. Now , after all this one and a half hours of discussion, we have said there is a minority view and there is a view. Even though I was not 100 percent satisfied with the drafting of paragraphs 5-11, however, I said I would go along with it. Now a couple of delegatio ns have exercised no doubt their sovereign right to express their view. This is reopening the whole thing, why 5-9, why not 5-11? They are missing out 11, why did they miss out 11? Why do they concentrate on 5 to 9? I am saying that they should indicate the ir reservations in the Drafting Committee, you have put it to the vote and they can do it. Why do they have to have their reservat ion in the main report? Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): S\u00f3lo queremos apoyar lo que acaba de decir nuestra colega y amiga de M\u00e9xico. Consideramos que no es sensato ni correcto que mientras que distinguidos y competentes colegas trabajan seriamente con nosotros en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, luego la distinguida y respetable jefe de esa delegaci\u00f3n se divierta irresponsablemente aqu \u00ed en esta Sala Roja. Angus MACDONALD (Australia): I wanted to take the floor to clarify the pos ition of my delegation and explain why we have just abstained in the vote that was taken. I wanted to indicate that that in no way suggested a resiling or a detraction from o ur position as a member of the drafting group, or in s upport of the draft. It was simply to ensure there was no misunderstanding, that this delegation very strongly holds to the principle and the right of the minority to express their views in this Council and t o have those views recorded. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United States of America): I too should like to say that we did not join with our other colleagues against the acceptance of this report. We did vote because two of those regulations, (although one I suggested was simply ignored), were mine. I did not think it sensible to vote that we should accept the report without the amendments that had been voted. As I wished to support the Drafting Comm ittee, I did not join with other colleagues reservations they have taken. -577- Akbar Mirza KHALEELI (India): It is my understanding that what you put to the vote was whether the majority went along with it with page 3 and page 4 of document CL/9 REP/8 (5 to 12 inclusive). Thirty members voted for, six voted against. What I would like to understand, the reservations made by our distinguished colleagues and representatives of Canada, I think they would lik e to express their reservations about the fact that paragraphs 5 to 9 do not reflect their views, and that that should be included i n this report. I think that is also a point of order, you put that to the vote also, so that it should not be included here. LEGAL COUNSEL: The reservations which made by certain specific paragraphs which they cannot go along with. It has been a practice in certain cases where it has unfortunately not been possible to accommodate all t he views of all the delegations to their respective satisfaction, that footnotes are included which specific delegati ons from specific paragraphs and I think this is what is intended on this particular occasion. Humberto CARRION M. (Nicaragua): Una aclaraci\u00f3n adicional que quisiera porque entend\u00ed que hab\u00edamos sometido todo el tema 9 con todos los p\u00e1rrafos incluidos a votaci\u00f3n; si adopt\u00e1bamos los textos presentados, no sometimos el tema p\u00e1rrafo por p\u00e1rrafo; supongo que la reserva ser\u00e1 sobre la totalidad del tema. Quisiera que se me aclarara porque creo que es algo novedoso esto. LE PRESIDENT: Le vote est intervenu sur les amendements propos\u00e9s aux paragraphes 5, 8, 11. Tels sont les quatre amendements. LEGAL COUNSEL: The vote was on the text of paragraphs 5 to 12 in its entirety. The vote was that this text should remain unchanged as drafted by the Drafting Committee. is adopted in that form certain delegations may find that some the paragraphs perfectly acceptable to them. They merely wish to indicate those paragraphs on which they have a reservation. Therefore, it is not necessary for the various delegations to make a reservation on the whole section. The reserva tion is just on those particular paragraphs of the text which was voted on as a block, which certain delegations have some difficult y in accepting. Therefore, I it is perfectly normal for those to indicate that their difficulties are with paragra phs 5 to 9. On the other hand, I assume, they have no difficulties with paragraphs 10 to 12, and thus the scope their reservation is at least Paragraph 12, including Draft Resolution, de r\u00e9solution, est approuv\u00e9 El p\u00e1rrafo 12, incluido el proyecto de resoluci\u00f3n, es aprobado Paragraphs 13 to 18 approved Les paragraphes 13 \u00e0 18 sont approuv\u00e9s Los p\u00e1rrafos 13 a 18 son aprobados Paragraphs 19 and 20 approved Les paragraphes 19 et 20 sont approuv\u00e9s Los p\u00e1rrafos y son aprobados Resolution, Le r\u00e9solution, est adopt\u00e9 El p\u00e1rrafo 21, incluida la Resoluci\u00f3n, es aprobado Draft Report of Plenary, part VIII, was, as amended, adopted amend\u00e9e, est adopt\u00e9e El proyecto de informe de la Plenaria, Parte VIII, asi enmendado, es aprobado -578- DRAFT REPORT-PART IX DE PROJET RAPPORT-PARTIE IX PROYECTO DE PARAGRAPHS 1 to 15 PARAGRAPHES 1 \u00e0 15 PARRAFOS 1 a 15 Hermann REDL (Austria): I shall try to be very precise to avoid difficulties. I followed the discussion of item 10 very careful ly, and on the basis of my long FAO experience I would like to propose the following change in paragraph 9. The first remain Programme and Finance Committees, by the Council and ultimately by the Conference. In the course of these discussions, Member Nations would have ample for programme priorities that might be pursued by FAO The Conference would finally be able to take, in a SERSALE DI CERISANO (Argentina): Es para apoyar la propuesta de Austria. Nos parece al menos que en espa\u00f1ol el texto queda mucho m\u00e1s claro. John GLISTRUP (Denmark): I can go along with the proposal made by Austria, which I think makes the text clearer, with one change in the last but one sentence. Instead of \"new directions\" he said \"programme priorities\". I can accept that y expressed on behalf of the Nordic countries. Joachim WINKEL (Germany, Federal Republic of): I support the amendment of Austria and the amendment proposed by Denmark, which better reflects the discussion. James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): To echo the comments of my German colleague, I would say that we support the amendment proposed by Austria together with the addition proposed by Denmark. Mrs Millicent M. FENWICK (United America): I would be anxious to s upport the proposal, but I worry about this business of innovative proposals. There is not a UN agency that does not try continually to broaden its mandate. I have struggl ed against this in the Programme Committee, and I do not think we should keep urging people to go into new pastures. It is one of the temptations of every bureaucracy, and I think the priorities are the important thing. The Committee on Agriculture, I suggest, would have a great deal to say. Therefore, I could support this, apart from urging my colleague from Denmark not to try to wide n the bureaucracy that already exists. George Henry MUSGROVE (Canada): We redrafted paragraph 9 put forward by the delegation of Austria, together with the slight amendment made by the delegation of Denmark with respect the inclusion para cpoya? tambi\u00e9n la prepuesta del texto que propuso Austria y con la eusereneia de edici\u00f3n de Dinamarca. Creemos que los srganos deliberativos, empelando por le Conferencia, cenemos la facultad no s\u00f3lo de discutir, definir o red\u00e9finir las prioridades a plaso medio, sino tambi\u00e9n cualquier otra nueva direcci\u00f3n que la Organisaci\u00f3n pueda tener dentro de sus Textos Fundamentales en su propia constituci\u00f3n. -579- John GLISTRUP (Denmark): I should like to assure my colleague from the United States that we certainly do not want to widen bureaucracy. In fact, her own delegation agreed to these words in the original draft, so I do not think it should be too diffic ult for her to accept this. Kosei SHIOZAWA (Japan): I should like to associate previous speakers in supporting the amendment proposed by proposed (Yugoslavia): I have tried to compare the existing text with the new one, and I find that the new one is simpler , direct, and in the right sequence of development. I think it will contribute to avoiding some possible mis understandings later, so I support the proposal made by Austria as amended by Denmark. FAO\". Temel ISKIT (Turkey): I asked for the floor to support the proposal of Austria as amended by Denmark, but after hearing the delegate of Congo perhaps thinking that his addition will allay some hesitations of our colleague from the United States, w e can support the proposal of Congo as well. Horacio CARANDANG (Philippines): I wanted to Regional because the Regional Conferences can suggest priorities. I hope that this paragraph does not mean that there is a change in the Basic Texts regarding the role of Regional Conferences in making suggestions on the Programme of Work. Sra. Margarita LIZARRAGA (M\u00e9xico): Nuestra delegaci\u00f3n quiere tambi\u00e9n apoyar la propuesta hecha por Austria con las modificaciones propuestas por Dinamarca y por Congo. Pero tambi\u00e9n tenemos un poquito la preocupaci\u00f3n, como en el caso de Filipinas, de que se habl\u00f3 pr\u00e1cticamente del COAG exclusivamente y creo que el texto original planteaba que de \"los \u00f3rganos t\u00e9cnicos, etc. , etc. , \", es decir, todas las instancias por las que prefiere pasar; no quisi\u00e9ramos que quedaran limitados el Comit\u00e9 de Pesca o el Comit\u00e9 de Montes. Sra. Mercedes FERM\u00cdN GOMEZ (Venezuela): Simplemente para expresar nuestro apoyo al p\u00e1rrafo 9, con las modificaciones presentadas por Austria, Dinamarca y Congo. Hermann REDL (Austria): Just a small point of clarification: indication. In this connection I would also like to draw your attention to the incorporation of the medium-term objectives of the Programme of Work and Budget as approved by the Council in November 1982, and the Conference considered in November 1983 the Programme of Work 1984/85 which also contains medium-term objectives. This was behind my idea. DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL: On a point of factual clarification the process set out in this paragraph now in the proposal for an amendment relates to events which will happen in 1987, leading up to the meeting of the Conference. There w ill be no Regional Conference next year, nor will there be a meeting of the Committees on Fisheries and Forestry and that is why they are not mentioned in this paragraph. There will, on the other hand, be a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture. That is the only reason why those parties are not specifically mentioned. I must correct myself, the Committee on Fisheries does meet in May, bu t not the Committee on Forestry or the Regional Conferences. -580- du Danemark du le Conseil. Pour \u00e9viter le fran\u00e7ais: objectifs \u00e1 moyen terme de l'Organisation ser ont de mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re par le Comit\u00e9 de l'agriculture, puis par le Comit\u00e9 du Programme et le Comit\u00e9 financier, puis p ar le Conseil, et, enfin, par l'Organisation, dans le cadre du mandat act Danemark et du Congo. Pouvons-nous consid\u00e9rer que le document CL 90/REP/9 est adopt\u00e9? James D. AITKEN (United Kingdom): There is one small factual point on paragraph 12, the final sentence begins, \"The Council recognized that concern etc. not raised in individual interventions it was simply raised from the Secretariat table at the end of the debate. I suggest in the interest of accuracy the reference would not be in accordance with the usual practice of Council to make here a specific reference to the Deputy Director-General. If the Council is not willing to endorse this statement perhaps some other such as, \"It was recognized\" or something like that Jos\u00e9 Ramon LOPEZ-PORTILLO ROMANO (Presidente del. Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n): Para anunciar, se\u00f1or Presidente, a todos los miembros del Consejo un cambio que lamentablemente se filtro a todos los textos en todos los idiomas en el p\u00e1rrafo 8. Es una peque\u00f1a frase que se habla suprimido en el Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n. Me refiero a la tercera oraci\u00f3n que empieza: \"Por otra parte, s i fuera a realizarse tal examen, no deber\u00eda basarse en una serie de propuestas y opciones disociadas artificialmente del conjunto de directrices, consensos y acuerdos surgidos de las deliberaciones de los \u00f3rganos rectores de la FAO. \" Por tanto, se suprimir\u00eda: y por consiguiente, potencialmente creadores de divisiones por su misma naturaleza. Esta frase que desgraciadamente se filtr\u00f3 en los textos, desaparece en todos los idiomas. Seguramente los miembros del Comit\u00e9 d e Redacci\u00f3n lo habr\u00e1n notado. LE PRESIDENT: Nous avons deux modifications concernant de r\u00e9daction, point 8 et ensuite au point la suggestion Paragraphs 1 to 15, as amended, 15, ainsi Los p\u00e1rrafos 1 a 15, asi enmendados, son aprobados Draft Report of Plenary-Pert IX. as amended, was adopted Projet pioniera-partie IX, ainsi amend\u00e9e, est adopt\u00e9e El proyecto de informe de la Plenaria -Parte IX. as\u00ed enmendado, es aprobado Je crois que nous arrivons au bout les d\u00e9l\u00e9gations. -581- Gonzalo BULA HOYOS (Colombia): Se\u00f1or Presidente, a nombre de los miembros del Consejo pertenecientes a la regi\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, queremos declarar que, a nuestro juicio, el resultado de esta reuni\u00f3n, plenamente satisfactorio par a todos, nos compromete una vez m\u00e1s a seguir unidos sin distinciones en el prop\u00f3sito com\u00fan de que la FAO trabaje cada d\u00eda mejor y m\u00e1s eficientemente en favor de todos los Estados Miembros, particularmente de aquellos en v\u00edas de desarrollo. Usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, ha contribuido much\u00edsimo al buen \u00e9xito de este per\u00edodo de sesiones Fue una. reuni\u00f3n plena de temas controvertidos, y en cierto momento hubo inquietudes, alcanzaron a agitarse las aguas. Pero usted, se\u00f1or Presidente, afortunadamente afront\u00f3 todas estas situaciones con serenidad, ponderaci\u00f3n, mesura, que los Latinoamericanos y del Caribe queremos reconocerle. Usted ha actuado con inteligencia y con imparcialidad y puede estar seguro de que al concluir hoy sus labores est\u00e1 rodeado por todos nosotros, se\u00f1or Presidente, un\u00e1nimemente con el tributo de respeto y de la admiraci\u00f3n que le profesamos.

Los Latinoamericanos pensamos que \u00e9ste ha sido un buen Consejo. El informe es muy aceptable, equilibrado y contiene orientaciones muy positivas para el \u00eduturo de nuestra Organizaci\u00f3n. Los miembros del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n actuaron todos con sincero deseo de acertar y de procurar el consenso en todas las oportunidades. Gracias a nuestros compa\u00f1eros de ese Comit\u00e9, que estuvo presidido por un colega y amigo que no obstante su juventud ya sobresale por su inteligencia, sus grandes capacidades, su consagraci\u00f3n y la firmeza con que suele defender sus convicciones democr\u00e1ticas. Con su labor como Presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez-Portillo Romano, digno representante de una gran naci\u00f3n como M\u00e9xico, ha honrado a su pa\u00eds, ha prestado un valioso servicio al Consejo y nos ha hecho sentir profundamente orgullosos a sus colegas y amigos, particularmente a nosotros los de su propia regi\u00f3n de Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe. El Comit\u00e9 de Redacci\u00f3n tuvo una Secretar\u00eda femenina atrayente y eficaz. El Director General, y pedimos al se\u00f1or Walton que le transmita este sentimiento, debe sentirse plenamente satisfecho. Sabemos que \u00e9l como Jefe de esta Organizaci\u00f3n recibe este reconocimiento bien merecido, con serenidad, con \u00e1nimo positivo porque en esta Sala Roja est\u00e1 representada toda la comunidad internacional y el Director General nos representa a todos sin distingos de ning\u00fan orden.

Durante seis a\u00f1os yo le hab\u00eda tenido de vecino de la derecha, y el Embajador Ariza a su izquierda. El Embajador Tchicaya nos har\u00e1 mucha falta, porque ellos han hecho valios\u00edsimas contribuciones. Finalmente, soplan vientos de oto\u00f1o; se aproximan las Navidades y 1986 toca a su final. Con todo respeto por las creencias religiosas de cada uno de los miembros del Consejo, les deseam os unas Navidades felices y serenas y que 1987 traiga para todos nosotros y nuestras familias todo lo mejor: paz, amor, alegr\u00eda, dicha y prosperidad. M. Afzal QADIR (Pakistan): Speaking on behalf of the Asian group, I would like to say how beholden we are to you for the excellent manner in which you have conducted the deliberations of this Council leading to fruitful and productive conclusion to this gathering. As Ambassador Bula Hoyos pointed out there were problems that were handled during the Session but with your wisdom, with your patience, with your charm and with your firmness we have been able to overcome these problems resulting in the happy conclusion we have been able to achieve. I would not like to go into details over the members of the Secretariat and members of the staff who have ably assisted you in producing the results that the Council was able to achieve. These things which have already been mentioned by Ambassador Bula Hoyos, we would like to endorse the tributes that he has paid to them, and as I say, we wish you success. We look forward to seeing you at the next meeting and it was a great pleasure working with you and we can assure you we will continue to extend wholehearted cooperation in the future. Having said this, I would like to raise a point which relates to the reply, which Afghanistan wanted to make to my reply which was brought about by a statement I had made. Now, you delayed him, you had disallowed him from taking the floor but before you silenced him he was able to say a few words and I would request you order the expungement of those. Adel Helmy EL SARKI (Egypt) (Original language Arabic): As we are at the conclusion of our Session, on behalf of the Egyptian delegation we would like to express our appreciation to you for your excellent guidance, your patience and your wisdom in listening to statements of our colleagues and to ours. I would like to thank all those who have presented the different documents that were discussed. I would like to support all those who saluted the efforts of the Drafting Comm ittee and we would like to reassure you that we will always cooperate with FAO. Mrs Milllcent M. FENWICK (United States of America): Canada is not here so I dare to speak for North America and I would like to thank you, Mr Chairman, and all of you six veterans up there on the podium, and Mr Roche, I see in the background there . It is endurance, endurance is one of our great virtues, and I would like to say something about my friend, L\u00f3pez-PortiIlo. I am not exactly a Latin American, but he is a very near and a very dear neighbour, and so I would like to say how much we have appreciated his work and how many compliments I have to send him, mail letters reporting all the compliments he has been getting as Chairman of the Drafting Committee. All of us here, and my colleagues, and the new members, those who have not been veterans as so many of us have of so many of these meetings, but we are all in it together and we all have purpose and however disparate our ways of reaching that goal may seem the important thing is that we are trying to do something useful in t he world, that is the point. If I think, as you know, of nothing but the little man at the end of the line, he is my target; other people have broader, more educated ideas, more expert, I am not denying it, but everybody tries to do it in his own way. I just would like to thank Miss killlngsworth especially, sitting up there. Everybody has joined in this enterprise in which I think it was from Mali we had a representative; this enterprise in which we are all partners. Jacques POSIER (France): Je n'ai pas eu le temps de Colombie, mais je ferai de cette grande comp\u00e9tence et du sens \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la n\u00e9gociation, d e mon coll\u00e8gue de Colombie, je termine aujourd'hui la session de mon mandat.
