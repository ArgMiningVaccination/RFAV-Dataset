Lai X, Wang J, Nabar Pan S, Tang C, Huang Y (2012). Proteomic response to acupuncture objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a LA protocol, developed and applied by nurses in patients with SAH. This study was based on the hypothesis that the application of AP as a technology for nursing care promotes a significant and who multicenter, a random assignment rate set at 50% per arm. This study was performed at the Laboratory of the Integrated Research-Assistance Programme (Pipa), Anna Nery School of Nursing, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (EEAN/UFRJ), the coordinating center of the study; and at the family health units linked to the Municipal Health Secretariats of the city of Maric\u00e1, in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and the city of Vit\u00f3ria, in the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo. This study was funded by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation/National Council for Scientific and Technological Development/Ministry of Health (MCTI/CNPq/MS), Public Notice number 007/2013, health practices, contributing to the displacement of the research team and for the purchase of equipment and inputs for the development of this study. Sample size was calculated based on in BP values after the application of AP protocols, with a 95% confidence level and 80% power. The sample consisted of 102 participants with SAH, regardless of both sexes, who met the following inclusion criteria: age between 30 and 75 years, undergoing drug treatment for SAH for a year or more, with difficulty to control blood pressure and maintaining the readings performed health professionals auriculotherapy, yoga, meditation, among others) were excluded. Patients with upper or lower limb amputations or amputations in areas located at acupuncture points, patients with cardiovascular complications or lesions target the patients cared for by them to the research team. Once the criteria for inclusion in the study were met, participants were referred to a nursing consultation with a nurse who was part of the research team, trained to obtain and register the variable under analysis. This professional provided guidance on the objectives of the study, risks, benefits, of participant being included in the simulation arm, through their expressed agreement. read (ICF) with the appropriate participant was given a registration number in and was referred to the random assignment carried out by another team member, specifically designated to this purpose. The random assignment was performed by block in a ratio of 1:1, using an outsourced service for the random assignment through the internet (http://www.sealedenvelope.com). The number assigned to the participants was entered into the system that automatically generated their assignment in one of the study arms, without the interference of participants, ensuring equal and independent inclusion chances, that is, both in Arm A - Intervention (acupuncture) and in Arm B - Control (simulation). Only the research assistant responsible for the random assignment was not blinded, being aware of the assignment groups of each participant and being responsible for the confidentiality of the random assignment sequence, as well as the preparation of the equipment for intervention of the research process. For this purpose, an equipment was used that had the same physical and structural characteristics of the equipment used for intervention, except absence of the internal emitting infrared laser. The participants, the evaluator nurse and the acupuncturist were carried out during the entire period of the study for the operationalization of the nursing care of participants in both arms. The nursing process guided the nursing consultations, with Martha of unitary human beings as theoretical basis. At the yoga, acupuncture) and changes in lifestyle. The same protocol was adopted for arms A and B, which was developed based on systematic review studies and a Nogier frequency of 6 MW, for 24 minutes and an interval of one week between the interventions. The selected acupoints, located in the head (frontal and (hands and arms) and lower (feet) limbs, received the direct application of the equipment on the skin.

For this purpose, BP was measured before and after each intervention, following a universal oscillometric method, with a precision registered at the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa), at the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (Inmetro), and recommended by the British Hypertension Society (BHS). The results were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, being under the responsability of the research assistant responsible for the random assignment and subsequently exported to the statistical analysis software. Statistica\u00ae software, version 12.0, was used for data analysis. Descriptive and association analyzes between variables were used, with a significance level set at 5% (p<0.05). The normal distribution of variables was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S); the comparison between the results of the pre and blood (CEP) of the Ana Nery School of Nursing/S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro approved this study, with the the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC), under the code UTN: Results In each arm consisted who were recruited from September to December 2014, at the research-coordinating center and at the health units of the participating center in the city of Vit\u00f3ria, ES. At the participating center in the city of Maric\u00e1, RJ, recruitment was carried out from March to May six-week follow-up period took place following the recruitment phase, and the study was completed in September 2015, due to the results. In that month, previous analyzes of the and the showed a significant difference between the control and intervention arms. A power of around 100% was found for the sample in the comparison between the moments in both arms. Based on these results, it was decided to discontinue the study, not including any other in (n=36) in arm B. Males represented 33.3% (n=17) of those assigned in arm A and 29.4% (n=15) in arm B. The mean and median ages of participants were 55.4-53.5 years, respectively, for women and 55.5-55.0 years for men. The mean BP of study participants was 158.8 the The length of drug treatment of participants was classified into three inclusion ranges: from 1 to 4 years, 36.3% (n=37), from 5 to 10 years, 37.2% (n=38) and from>10 years, 26.5% (n=27). The use of monotherapy for the treatment of blood pressure of participants was not identified, with combination therapy participants did not attend the visits without removal of their dropping out due various reasons such as the need for frequent travel, new job and change of address. This resulted in loss of follow-up in both arms of the study ( [Figure 2]()). In arm A, there was a loss of 15.6% (n=8), while in arm B (n=15), loss of of the sample among women in arm B which had a reduction of 33.3% (n=12) when compared the arm A (intervention), whose reduction was 14.7 % (n=5). In the period from August to September 2015, an interim analysis was performed considering 79 participants in total. On that occasion, 23 losses were observed in total, which did not compromise the reliability of the results, as demonstrated by the K-S test for normality, since the null hypothesis (p>0.05) was not rejected in the normal probability exposures the median varied from 5 to 6 exposures, being more regular in arm A, with an average of 5 exposures and SD=1.4\u00b11.3 for the sexes, 1](). Distribution of participants in the research. Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, 2015 In the final analysis, it was considered only the total number of participants attending all sessions, that is, 43 participants in arm A and 36 in arm B. It was noted that the study was initiated, in arms A and B, with BP redings above 140x90 mmHg in the pre- and post-intervention moments. arm A, significant differences were observed in BP levels at different moments of observation, with a trend of constant reduction, reaching a plateau of 128x80 mmHg (at moment post-intervention). In arm B, no significant differences were observed in the mean BP values, at the different moments of observation, in pre- and post-exposure measurements in both arms of the study. Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, 2015 By comparing the moments between 1 and 6, it was observed a significantly higher variation in BP reduction in arm A than that observed in arm B. These results for SBP and DBP in both arms of the study. Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, 2015 No undesirable effects or adverse events that required the need to exchange participants between groups or compromised the quality of the study were identified or reported. Discussion This study confirmed the hypothesis that AP, combined with drug treatment, has efficacy in the acute control of BP in patients with difficulty controlling their blood pressure levels. In studies using other therapies for BP control77 Kim HM, Cho SY, Park SU, Sohn IS, Jung WS, Moon SK, et al.

It is considered that nurses specialized in AP, by incorporating it as a nursing care technology, may help hypertensive patients to effectively control their BP, since its use helps to achieve the therapeutic goal for BP.

The effects of acupuncture on the levels of blood pressure and nitric oxide in BP but a very small reduction in its levels, as observed in Arm B ( [Table 2]()), were also noticed in control groups of studies in which AP was used1414 Wang, J,Xiong, X,Liu,W. essential hypertension.

Acupuncture the posture adopted by the participants during the course of the research, by assuming a commitment with the treatment, especially those with failures in the drug treatment due to low adherence or forgetfulness. The care component, provided in the relationship between the health and research team and the patient, may also have had an impact. It seems consider patient/health professionals bond is favored because of the need for weekly attendance at the health unit to perform the procedure. In addition, there has been a significant in BP monitoring, making it possible the early recognition of the need for adjustments in the medication doses and other non-drug interventions. This health promotion contribution participation, conversations that occurred throughout the study. It be noted that longitudinal effects, after discontinuation of therapy, have not yet been addressed, which is a limiting factor of this research for generalizing the results, a similar situation also found in other studies on the efficacy of the method1414 Wang, J,Xiong, X,Liu,W. for essential hypertension. DZ, Zhou Y, Yang YN, Ma YT,1 Li XM, Yu J et al. Acupuncture indicate that people of both sexes, in an age group with predominance of SAH, without complications, undergoing the recommended drug treatment, who do not participate in special programs of physical activity or diets and with difficulty in controlling their blood pressure levels, may benefit from this type of intervention. It is worth stressing that this clientele profile is very common, especially in the area of basic health care. Another relevant aspect is the use of protocols in health practices aimed at a single and holistic care, as is the case of AP, inserted in the list of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (CIP). It is noteworthy that the adoption of predefined terapy protocols with the use of AP in its different techniques is an important limitation to be studies, need to prove the efficacy of these techniques. In this context, in order to overcome the aforementioned limitation and, at the same time, contemplate the fundamental characteristics of the RTC method and the theoretical-philosophical principles of the TCM/AP, the protocol elaborated in this was developed based on the human processes frequently affected in people with SAH, according to the different interpretations of SAH by the TCM. Therefore, it is inferred that the reasoning used for the development of this protocol has positively favored the achievement of the results. When participants review studies that investigated the of AP for the treatment of SAH66 Zhao XF, YN, Ma YT,1 Li XM, Yu J et al. Acupuncture initial and final nursing consultations and no were that to BP alterations. The same reasoning was used for exclusion of smokers and alcoholics, considering that possible interruption of smoking and alcohol consumption could interfere in the reduction of blood pressure levels. The exclusion of the use of other CIP by participants during the intervention possible as the use of other CIP, concomitant with drug treatment, may also influence the BP Salles .

The limitations this the participants, the non-measurement of longer time interval and/or less regularity in the performance of the the results did study and the obtained results. it is considered that the results observed contribute to the improvement of scientific knowledge in Nursing since they show a new therapeutic possibility for intervention and care of people with arterial hypertension, to be performed by acupuncturist nurses or recommended by nurses who recognize this practice as a method for the care of their patients. Conclusion Based on the results, it was possible to confirm the efficacy of the protocol. There was an acute reduction and a significant BP control in all participants of arm A during the intervention period, indicating the possibility of using this technology in the care of hypertensive patients. In order to further deepen and better understand the results of the protocol in a long term, as well as the improvement of BP levels after its discontinuation other diseases influence the complica\u00e7\u00f5es em hipertensos/diab\u00e9ticos de uma regional sanit\u00e1ria do nordeste brasileiro.
