In our setting we not have data available on poisoned patients requiring admission to the ICU in the 21st century because the last nationwide study was published back in the 1980s. [1](#bib0005) The objective of this paper is to know the epidemiology of poisoned patients requiring admission to the ICU during 2 different periods of time, and the variations that have occurred in both periods. It is a multicenter required ICU admission in hospitals between 2006. The second phase prospectively included poisoned patients admitted to 16 Spanish ICUs 2013 and 2014. Data analysis was performed using SAS\u00ae University Edition software. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, the Breslow-Day test, and the Wilcoxon and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The categorical variables were expressed as n (%) and quantitative variables as mean (standard deviation). The first study phase included 340 patients and the second, 561. The rate of poisoned patients was 1.90% admitted to these units during the second study period (data on the first period are not available). The demographic characteristics and types of toxic agents are SD, standard deviation. During the first period a total of 672 toxic agents/patient were reported, with a ratio of 1.98 toxic agents/patient. A total of 994 toxic agents (1.77 toxic agents/patient) were reported during the second period. most common agents of each phase are shown on [Table 2](#tbl0010). The most common one in both periods were benzodiazepines, but the distribution of other toxic agents has changed significantly. Alcohol intoxication has improved (P = .0002), and in up to 60 cases (48%) it is the only toxic agent involved, which represents 10.70% of the patients from the period. Most toxic agents respect to the total number of toxic agents). In both periods, around half of the patients had used more than just 1 toxic agent. The most common ones associated with other toxic agents were psychoactive medications and substance abuse. Although between both periods, the only significant difference was found intoxications with ethanol P = .007). The intentionality of poisoning within the first period was self-harm in 172 patients (46.11%), accidental in 62 (16.62%), and recreational in 96 (28.24%). The intentionality within the second period was never recorded. Regarding specific ICU setting was 10.53% (32 patients) the first study period, and 6.06% (34 patients) during the second period (P = .018). Acute poisonings are still a rare entity at the ICU setting. Although the distribution of the different toxic agents a change in substance abuse habits as confirmed by the more likely, indicative of consumption of alcohol. However, opioid poisoning has dropped, although it has gone up in countries like the United States. [2,3](#bib0010) The evolution of both alcohol and heroin use is associated with the data shown in the 2018 report published by the Spanish Observatory on Drugs and Addictions. [4](#bib0020) Although we there are no data available on the study period since the EDADES survey was collected for the last time, it seems that in our setting opioid abuse is not a problem, [5](#bib0025) which would explain the differences seen with respect to the United States. The increased substance abuse is also evident on the patients. Although the second period the study not include the intentionality of poisoning, the population older age may have something to do with this. On the other hand, mortality rate is high in both study periods compared to data from other neighboring countries 2%. [8,9](#bib0040) Still, has 42% between the 2 periods studied down to rates similar to the ones described by the last multicenter study on Spanish ICUs published in 1983. [1](#bib0005) The higher prevalence of poisoning due to industrial products seen within the first period can be the reason behind such a high mortality rate. Still, in the future, the adequacy of the therapies administered should be studied in close is that, although some centers participate in both periods, others only did so in one study period. This means that geographic variability may explain some of the differences seen. Also, no incidence rate of this type of disease with respect to ICU admissions was collected within the first study period. No past medical history, severity or sex distribution was collected within the second study period either. Although most of the poisonings that end up in the Spanish ICUs are due to psychoactive drugs, there are differences in the types of toxic agents involved in relation to the different patterns of consumption. of them probably reflect the appearance of dangerous patterns of consumption as the case of ethanol epidemic of deaths due to opioids seen in the United States. This study is part of a PhD program in psychiatry conducted at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain.
