All systems and organs of the human body are reflected in the feet. Each area and point on the legs reflects a particular organ and area in the body. The feet are a reflection of the body. Special presses and massages of these points, allow to treat and alleviate a variety of medical problems throughout the through feet improves brings balance and helps the natural healing power of the body and mind. The word reflexology is divided into two: Reflex Derived from which means reflection - symbolizes the reflection of the body as well as the mind and spirit in the feet. In addition, Reflex in English means reaction that touching the foot, causes a reaction in the body. Logic meaning, science. A bit of history: There is evidence that as early as 2000-3000 years ago there were therapists through the feet in both the Far East and Egypt. Anita Diamant's book The Red Tent deals with birth treatments and the like as early as ancient Egypt. Today's reflexology was founded at the beginning of the last century when the surgeon Dr. William Fitzgerald who conducted various studies on his patients realized that pressing in the foot leads to pain relief or anesthesia. Dr. Fitzgerald called this method Various body systems. Along with the same doctor, a physiotherapist nurse named Eunice Ingham worked. She who of to the method used today and succeeded in proving that the whole human body can be treated through the feet. Sister Ingham was the one who gave the field the name reflexology, created the first reflexology map and also wrote the first book of reflexology (stories that feet tell). Because there is a direct connection between body and mind, reflexology works in an amazing combination on both. Since humans are part of nature, reflexology reflects nature in the feet. Nature has 4 main elements and reflexology maps these 4 components and their reflection in the feet as well: The earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element. - Soil - The soil element in the body is from the pelvis down. In the foot the earth element is located in the heel (360 degrees). - Water - The water element in the body is from the pelvis to below the chest (diaphragm muscle). In the foot the water element is located from the heel terminal to below the tread pad (360 degrees) - Fire - The fire element in the body is below the chest to the middle of the throat. In the foot the fire element is located in the entire area of the tread pad (360 degrees). - Air - The air element in the body is from the end of the throat to the tip of the head. In the foot the air element is located throughout the toe area (360 degrees). Each physiological systems as well as personal characteristics: - The earth element - represents all the bones and teeth in the body, stability, roots, determination, instincts, basic needs of man and the past. - The water element - represents all the fluids in the body, calmness, flow, power, rejuvenation, intuitions, adaptability, emotions and the present. - The fire element - represents all the muscles and tendons desires and the near future. - The air element - represents the nervous system, spirituality, situations, thoughts distant future. In a Western way, the various organs in the human body communicate with each other, work in harmony with each other, pass information between them and dispose of waste. Holistically, similar to the body's physiological lymphatic system, there is a network of energetic channels between the organs which drains into the feet, where there are \"drainage ponds\". When there is a certain problem with one organ or another, a lot of waste accumulates in the \"drainage pool\" and the body strives to dispose of this waste. The ancients lived in nature and walked barefoot on the ground, vegetation receive a the feet would be transferred to the ground. Today, we also walk less and when we are already walking, we wear shoes and usually walk on straight surfaces. By doing so we have effectively severed the connection of the feet with the ground and we prevent grounding to the body. As a result, there is a situation where there is a production of waste but it is not possible to dispose of it. The energy waste begins to accumulate and turn into small grains like sand. Over time the grains accumulate into \"crystals\" which are actually crystals that are the surface. At this point the Western approach fits in, as the \"crystals\" are known and recognized conventional medicine. felt the therapist and often pressing on them is painful for the patient. With the help of reflexology treatment, the therapist breaks down the \"crystals\" the the waste is drained by the bloodstream, urine and other systems out of the body. In this way, reflexology combines the forces of body and mind and brings about a relaxation that is not possible in daily life, now the body can activate its natural healing mechanisms and bring about massagers and pressure are applied to certain points in the foot, in this way, a message passes to the body and the brain and begins a process of healing and releasing blockages. The pressures and massages of the feet lead to better blood flow, give life and strengthening to the internal organs, allow cleansing and release of waste and toxins the body by sweating, urinating and normal bring about a cleansing load and fatigue from the head and thus help in healing the sick body even the patient has complained of. Over the years, reflexology has been recognized by conventional medicine as a complementary and effective treatment for a variety of body and mind problems. Today reflexology is common in medical institutions and "}
