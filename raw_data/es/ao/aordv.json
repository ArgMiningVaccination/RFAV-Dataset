G. catenatum is most abundant during March and April, usually associated with water temperatures between 18 and 25 \u00baC and an increase in nutrients. In vitro studies of G. catenatum strains from different bays along the Pacific coast of Mexico show that this species can grow in wide ranges of salinities, temperatures, ratios. differences are observed in the toxicity and toxin profile, but the presence of dcSTX, dcGTX2-3, C1, and C2 are usual components. A common characteristic of the toxin profile found in shellfish, when G. catenatum is present in the coastal environment, is the detection of dcGTX2-3, one pair, compared with strains from other regions. 1. Introduction This review covers the state of knowledge of scientific studies of Gymnodinium catenatum Graham from the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico. Many of the relevant studies have only been published in journals with low international impact, however this species is the most algal blooms a cosmopolitan species, occurring in the North Pacific, South East Pacific, Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, South Caribbean Sea, East Arabian Sea, China Sea, South East Indian Ocean, and the Tasmanian Sea. This species is an unarmored is a potential threat to species including human health. 2. Distribution of Gymnodinium catenatum along the Western Coasts of Mexico and Associated Toxic Events In Mexico, G. catenatum has only been reported along the Pacific coast ( [Figure 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)). Blooms of this species were first observed in 1939 in the northern central part of the Gulf of California [ [1](#b1-marinedrugs-08-01935), [2](#b2-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. G. catenatum is by Oshima et al. [ [4](#b4-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Probably the first record of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) on the Mexican Pacific was in 1939 [ [5](#b5-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. The first PSP linked to G. catenatum occurred from the coast of Sonora to Jalisco states in 1979, with a toxicity reaching up to 7,500 g STXeq were most seriously affected were between five and 14 years old [ [6](#b6-marinedrugs-08-01935), [7](#b7-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Since 1979, 10 cases of intoxication have occurred in this bay [ [8](#b8-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. During the last few years, reports of HAB and presence of this species in several bays along the have focused mainly on local blooms. most [55](#b55-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Blooms usually few or weeks [ [54](#b54-marinedrugs-08-01935)], causing the sea to appear [56](#b56-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. 3. Ecological Studies Nutrients play an important role in relation ecosystems [ [57](#b57-marinedrugs-08-01935)- [59](#b59-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Eutrophication seems to be the principal reasons for the increase in frequency and the number of species causing HAB events as well as duration of blooms [ [60](#b60-marinedrugs-08-01935), [62](#b62-marinedrugs-08-01935)- [66](#b66-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Along the Pacific coast of Mexico, few studies have been done relating variations of nutrients with the presence or Most studies result from opportunistic observations; therefore, they lack physical and chemical data. In this section, we review the published information and, for the sake of clarity, the ecological studies are separated into four geographical regions: the Gulf of California, the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula, the central Mexican Pacific, and the southern Mexican Pacific (see [Figure 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)). 3.1. Gulf of California The Gulf of California is a subtropical, semi-enclosed sea with exceptionally of nutrient inputs mainly coming from agriculture activities of the East coast [ [68](#b68-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Several bays are found in this area: Bah\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles, Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, Bah\u00eda de La Paz, Bah\u00eda Bacochibampo, and Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n. The biggest urban developments in this region are the cities of La Paz and Mazatl\u00e1n. The hydrography and seasonal productivity in the the number species and duration of HAB events in the Gulf of California has increased [ [12](#b12-marinedrugs-08-01935), [54](#b54-marinedrugs-08-01935)], with G. catenatum being one of toxic species that frequently forms blooms. Graham [ [1](#b1-marinedrugs-08-01935)] found G. catenatum for the first time in samples collected in March 1939 in the northern part of the Gulf of California (~29\u00b0 N), forming a visible bloom \u00d7 \u00b0C and 35.07-35.50 psu. More recently in this area, this species was reported in Puerto Libertad [ [9](#b9-marinedrugs-08-01935)] and Bah\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles [ [11](#b11-marinedrugs-08-01935)] ( [Table In present without forming and is abundant when the water column is stratified with high concentrations of nutrients localized [ In this et al. [ [16](#b16-marinedrugs-08-01935)] reported a temperature range between 22 \u00b0C and for G. catenatum ( [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/table/t1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)) and suggested that the in outbreaks in of 298 g SXT eq 100 g1 in May 1999 [ [13](#b13-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n is one of the few bays where studies on cyst dynamics have been done. Yields of cysts of G. catenatum are low, but seem to be a constant inoculum that sustains its population for long periods [ [75](#b75-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Cysts of this species have a short maturation period and can germinate under a wide range 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)), red tide events were monitored from 1970 through to 1994, with G. catenatum being one of the responsible species; however, were This bay and other dinoflagellate species [10](#b10-marinedrugs-08-01935)] and winds. at \u00b1 0.99 1.03 psu, with phosphates and nitrates ranging from 0.54 to 3.0 mg L 1 and 0.1 to 0.2 mg L 1, respectively. In Bah\u00eda de La Paz ( [Figure 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)), G. with from 1.6 \u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 106 cell L1 within a temperature range from 18 to 26.5 \u00baC. In some events toxins have been detected in phytoplankton net samples and scallops, but toxin concentrations in scallops have never been above the maximum level for human consumption (0.14-67 g SXT eq 100 g1) has also coincided with other bloom forming species. In June 2003, low cell densities (800-1,200 cells L1) of this species were bloom of Chaetoceros 2007, N. scintillans [ [21](#b21-marinedrugs-08-01935)], during G\u00e1rate-Liz\u00e1rraga et al. [ of the and Gyrodinium instriatum Freudenthal et Lee. In June 2003, the presence of G. catenatum was associated with upwelling waters with high concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate (4.5 M, 7.4 M, and 1.4 M, respectively). However, these nutrient concentrations did not to the dominance of the diatom. In June-July of 2006, another HAB event was recorded in Bah\u00eda de La Paz [ [19](#b19-marinedrugs-08-01935), [20](#b20-marinedrugs-08-01935)], under low nitrates, ammonium, and phosphates were low (1.0, 0.9, and 0.8 M, respectively) [ [20](#b20-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Along the coastal lagoons of Sinaloa (eastern shore of the Gulf of California), G. catenatum is a common bloom forming species [ [78](#b78-marinedrugs-08-01935), [79](#b79-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. The first HAB reported in Mexico of this species was in Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n ( [Figure 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)) from February to April of 1979. was very intense and extensive, with average cell densities of 1.2 \u00d7 106 cells PST in bivalves ( [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/table/t1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)). Since this event, this area has been one of the most extensively monitored in our country. Between 1981 and 2006, many blooms of G. catenatum have been reported, however toxin analyses have not always been reported. From 2003 to 2007, PST in mollusks were between 63 and 1315 g SXTeq 100 g1[ [30](#b30-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Analysis of the HAB of G. catenatum occurring in this area demonstrate that these events occurred mainly in late winter and early spring [ [9](#b9-marinedrugs-08-01935), [15](#b15-marinedrugs-08-01935), [23](#b23-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. The effect of the El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a event for this species is not clear since Alonso-Rodr\u00edguez and Ochoa [ [80](#b80-marinedrugs-08-01935)] did not find any bloom of G. catenatum during La Ni\u00f1a 2000 in Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n, however in Bah\u00eda de Bacochibampo, blooms of G. catenatum found to increase during a La Ni\u00f1a events[ [55](#b55-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n, G. catenatum has August 1996) with wind mixing processes, which to the resuspension February 1996, an 2.5 \u00b0C in the mean surface temperature (from 24.5 \u00b0C to 22 \u00b0C) followed by a rapid rise in temperature to 24.0 \u00b0C, over a three day time period, coincided with a bloom of G. catenatum [ [83](#b83-marinedrugs-08-01935)], suggesting that the temperature change favored the growth of species. Recently, in Laguna de Macapule, a coastal lagoon in Sinaloa, G. catenatum was reported with an of 38.8 \u00d7 103 cell L1 [ [32](#b32-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Clearly, Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n is one of the zones in Mexico with the highest number of studies on the presence of red tide events caused by G. catenatum. Palynological records show that G. catenatum cysts have been present in the Gulf of California since ~1483 [ [81](#b81-marinedrugs-08-01935)], with higher to 1994 as the SST increased in this area. 3.2. West Coast of Baja California Peninsula The western coast of the Baja California Peninsula is influenced by the California and North-equatorial Currents [ [83](#b83-marinedrugs-08-01935)], and El Ni\u00f1o events [ [86](#b86-marinedrugs-08-01935), [90](#b90-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. It has a low human influence that is mainly linked to local fisheries of sardines and mollusks [ Bah\u00eda Magdalena, found coastal upwelling [ [90](#b90-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In this bay, been found in low concentrations (1200 to 4200 cells L1) near Punta Colnett, during summer when regional upwelling is dominant [ [33](#b33-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. 3.3. Central Mexican Pacific This area is important zone, and The principal bays in this area are Bah\u00eda Banderas and Bah\u00eda de Manzanillo. In Bah\u00eda de Manzanillo the main merchant ship commerce is found [ [91](#b91-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Eutrophication [ discharges have been observed [ [92](#b92-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In Puerto Vallarta, G. catenatum was reported for the first time in 1979 ( [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/table/t1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)), during the same event that extended from La Cruz de Elota, Sinaloa to Jalisco [ [6](#b6-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In the winter and spring of 1999, a bloom of G. catenatum lasted approximately three months covering a large [41](#b41-marinedrugs-08-01935)] ( [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/table/t1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)); g-at L1). dispersed the biomass, which avoided anoxic conditions that limit the length of the bloom [ [93](#b93-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. During 2000 and 2001, HAB of G. catenatum were documented in Puerto Vallarta and Bah\u00eda de Banderas ( [Figure 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)) [ [35](#b35-marinedrugs-08-01935)- [37](#b37-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. [37](#b37-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In toxin was high (235 g STXeq 100 g1) [ [42](#b42-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In a recently monitored area (L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Michoac\u00e1n), a G. catenatum bloom was reported for the first time in November 2005, with density proposed for explain the presence of these blooms: eutrophication linked [ [38](#b38-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. detailed be carried out to confirm these hypothesis. 3.4. Southern Mexican Pacific In this area important tourist influence is observed of nutrients [ [95](#b95-marinedrugs-08-01935), [96](#b96-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. The principal bays are Bah\u00eda de Acapulco, Laguna Corralero-Alotengo, and Bah\u00edas de Huatulco. Bah\u00eda de Acapulco ( [Figure 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)) is a shallow bay (average depth, 20 high anthropogenic impact and land drainage [ [95](#b95-marinedrugs-08-01935), [96](#b96-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In March-April 1999, a red tide of G. catenatum was registered for the first time in Bah\u00eda de Acapulco ( 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/figure/f1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)), with cell concentrations 103 cells L1), January 2006 (10 \u00d7 106 cells L1), and December 2007 (1942 \u00d7 103 cells L1) [ [47](#b47-marinedrugs-08-01935), [97](#b97-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. These G. catenatum abundances are the values in mollusks during these events varied 100 g1( [Table 1](/pmc/articles/PMC2901831/table/t1-marinedrugs-08-01935/)) [ [48](#b48-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Further Oaxaca, blooms of [ [52](#b52-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. 2001, however was another PSP toxin producer. 4. Grazing Studies There are few records on the effect of grazing activity on G. catenatum under G. catenatum by N. scintillans may by the high swimming velocity of N. scintillans. Grazing of N. scintillans on cells of G. catenatum (chains of 4-16 cells per Noctiluca) has also been observed in Bah\u00eda de Los Angeles, Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, and Bah\u00eda de La Paz [ [47](#b47-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In vitro studies catenatum, with no visible short time harmful effects on the copepod [ [101](#b101-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. These data suggest that N. scintillans grazing be G. Toxin from phytoplankton net samples is a method to confirm that a toxic organism is found in the plankton community, and can help us understand the toxin profile of a toxic species in the environment. The toxin profile in net phytoplankton samples for Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, Bah\u00eda de La Paz, and Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n has been variable, however STX, neoSXT, GTX2-3, are usually the toxins with a high molar contribution [ [15](#b15-marinedrugs-08-01935), [21](#b21-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Average toxin content reported in field samples from Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n varied from 3.8 to 639.1 ng PSP filter1, and in Bah\u00eda de La Paz from 4.32 to 90.54 ng PSP filter1, Differences in the toxin profile have observed in event; these differences could be explained by the different development stages of the red tide [ [21](#b21-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. More data are needed from field samples in order explain these of G. catenatum S trains Very limited data exists on the toxin content of natural populations of G. catenatum. G\u00e1rate-Liz\u00e1rraga et al. [ [102](#b102-marinedrugs-08-01935)] and Band-Schmidt et al. [ [103](#b103-marinedrugs-08-01935), [104](#b104-marinedrugs-08-01935)], found that the toxin content of the G. catenatum strains of the Gulf higher in the environment. However, more data on toxin content per cell under natural needs to be obtained confirm these differences. the toxin catenatum are only in some strains and in low molar percentage (below 3 mol%) [ [17](#b17-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. In is (from [104](#b104-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. not strain origin composition in differences chain length, since cultures with a higher percentage of long chains had more neoSTX, while those with a higher proportion of short chains had a lower concentration cell1), to changes culture N:P ratios. For example, when cultivating a strain from BACO with N:P ratios ranging from 1:6 to 32:1, no observable differences were found in the toxin profile across the different [ [105](#b105-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. neoSTX often varies [Table the a differential of saxitoxin analogs of G. catenatum [ [104](#b104-marinedrugs-08-01935), [105](#b105-marinedrugs-08-01935)]: after the tenth day of growth with different N:P ratios, an increase the composition during the first eight days of culture, with a carbamoyl production from 9 to 14% and decarbamoyl production below 5% [ [105](#b105-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. It seems that strains from the Gulf of California are characterized by the presence of neoSTX, and they seem to have evolved particular physiological responses to their environment that are reflected in their toxin profiles, suggesting different populations. Also, in the toxin profiles of G. catenatum isolated from different zones of the Mexican Pacific (Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n, and Bah\u00eda de La Paz), could be related to the differences in the source and concentration of nutrients of each [ [102](#b102-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. 5.3. Presence PST Mollusks Linked to HAB of G. catenatum The analyses of the toxin content in different clams and scallops of several embayments from the Gulf of California has been done the presence of in de STXeq mollusk species. In general, mollusks usually contained a high of C1 and in marine bivalves has been performed in Bah\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles, Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, Bah\u00eda de La Paz, and Bah\u00eda de and abundance of G. catenatum cells in the water column, showing clear were the most abundant toxins, contributing usually more than 60% of the total toxin content. These high molar percentage contributions of the N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins involved. toxic that toxicity in scallops from the Gulf of California are linked to this dinoflagellate [ [108](#b108-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. The presence of PST (GTX-2 and C1) has also been found in the liver of puffer fish Sphoeroides annulatus Jenyns from Bah\u00eda Paz and the mucus of Arothron meleagris Laceep\u00e9de from Punta Pericos. The analyses the of these organisms, and the existence of PST dinoflagellates (e.g. G. catenatum) in the zone suggest the transfer of these toxins via mollusks[ [109](#b109-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. 6. Effects of Marine Organisms or Toxic Effects of G. catenatum on Other Organisms 6.1. Laboratory Studies Experimental work utilizing ischemic zone in the liver border. A degeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum was also observed in histological observations of on higher consumption of G. catenatum. In the same experiment, the also on larvae (Litopenaeus vannamei Boone) was lethal [99](#b99-marinedrugs-08-01935)] longer period and histological damages were observed in the heart, gastric gland, and brain tissue. These observed to G. catenatum cells. Mortality of Artemia exposed to G. catenatum has been observed previously [ [113](#b113-marinedrugs-08-01935)], and it has been demonstrated that Artemia can transfer PST via the marine damages were observed in the heart, in these studies were observed; the strain used by Estrada et al. [ [115](#b115-marinedrugs-08-01935)] was rich in gonyautoxins, while the toxin profile of the strain those reported previously [ [17](#b17-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. These differences could be suggests a biotransformation process [ depuration rate day in the clam [ [108](#b108-marinedrugs-08-01935)] and 0.4 day in the scallop [ [115](#b115-marinedrugs-08-01935)], the toxin content after the thirteenth day in clams was only 4-5% of that found at the time of initiation. Short-term effects (24 h) on the immunological system of the clam N. subnodosus, when fed with G. catenatum, were also antioxidant exposed to G. catenatum cells [ [120](#b120-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Different responses to toxin exposure can be expected, other toxic species along the coast of Sinaloa (Gulf of California), caused the death of nauplii G. catenatum in the water introduced to the ponds by the pumping system. The mortality occurred with the events of HAB of G. catenatum from February to March 2001, concluding that the conditions, inadequate can delay in the growth of the shrimp and decrease their production through massive mortality. Sierra-Beltr\u00e1n et al. [ [122](#b122-marinedrugs-08-01935)] speculated that in the central part of the Gulf of California, the urban aquatic residues and the eutrophication generated by the shrimp be responsible proliferation of G. and other species. Garc\u00eda-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [10](#b10-marinedrugs-08-01935)] larvae producing laboratories are deposited without treatment to Bah\u00eda Kun Kaak, which is known to be a highly productive ecosystem. This natural condition, and the water phosphorus compounds, to of tides. Other regions of the coasts of Sonora (Gulf of California) had high nitrogen contributions, related to fertilization process, by runoff (36.8 \u00d7 106-201 \u00d7 106 moles N) that this loss by irrigation can support phytoplankton blooms in the Gulf of California. It is probable that the eutrophication processes in this ecosystem are seasonal events [ [123](#b123-marinedrugs-08-01935)] are influenced by upwelling events, agriculture, and aquaculture Dumping and wastewater treatment regulations are recommended to good and in of the quality that flows into and out of shrimp culture systems. 7. Growth Variations of G. catenatumStrains of the Gulf of California Growth rates of different mL1 and are usually obtained between 14 and 18 days of growth. Table highest growth rates (0.18-0.21 day1) are obtained salinity range (15-40 ups) is also Concepci\u00f3n. The optimal temperature and salinity ranges coincide with the temperatures and salinities at which G. catenatum has been reported in different regions of the Mexican Pacific, with the exception of the Northern Gulf of California where G. catenatumhas been reported at temperatures (see ecological studies). 8. LSUrDNA Sequences amplifications of Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n strains the fragment of the nuclear large subunit rDNA gene resulted in a single product of approximately 889 base pairs [ [124](#b124-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Strains from Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n present a constant a single nucleotide polymorphism was mutation catenatum produces PST, is distributed along the Mexican Pacific coast, and has been related to the presence of PST in mollusks. Scarce reports exist on the physical conditions coastal ecosystem associated with blooms of G. catenatum. Nevertheless, from available information, we tolerates N:P ratios which probably has allowed its distribution along the Mexican Pacific. Its toxicity has been related to nutrient availability. Its capacity to produce PST and human health costs has directed more attention towards the study of this species, increasing the number of published records in recent years as well as records in different regions of the country. However, many of these publications remain as thesis and/or have been published in Spanish journals, thus limiting their access for international colleagues. A high percentage of these blooms have been associated with an increase the nutrient events or periods in the water column, and with low SST. In many occasions, G. catenatum has been found with other bloom forming species. Future investigations need to focus on the evaluation the eutrophication process with systematic monitoring that the alterations the organic matter balance, inorganic nutrients, and the interaction of different species associated with the presence of G. catenatum. In addition, more attention needs to be of and their possible role on the development or regulation of HAB of this species. The toxin profile found in net phytoplankton samples, shellfish, and G. catenatum strains of the Gulf of California is variable, however a common characteristic is that dcGTX2-3, dcSTX, C1, and C2 are always present. Unfortunately, many programs monitoring HAB events of G. catenatum in our country do not have the possibility to determine toxin content in mollusks, and so far, no studies have been done on the benzoate and deoxy decarbamoyl type toxins. In some regions, data the toxin analyses of phytoplankton net samples have proved to be useful in the monitoring activities of HAB of G. catenatum, an early detection method for planktonic toxin producing organisms. More data on the toxin content per cell of field samples of G. catenatum be However, latitudinal have the toxin profile in cultured strains from different embayments of the Gulf of California. So far strains from Bah\u00eda de Mazatl\u00e1n have a between environmental factors and toxin variability. show that Mexican G. catenatum strains effects were observed in the copepod A. clausi, when fed with this dinoflagellate. It has been stated that the copepod and Noctiluca could play a key role in controlling the occurrences of red tides of this species. Clearly, more research must be done to evaluate the role of G. catenatumin the ecosystem and aquaculture activities of D1-D2 LSU rDNA sequences of the same region in strains examined from Europe, Asia or Australia. This suggests that this species in the Gulf of California is not an introduced species, and could be used as a genetic marker for this population. At the moment, the design of DNA probes for the detection of G. catenatum in water samples is being carried out. This is supported with palinological studies that have demonstrated the presence of G. catenatum in this region since ~1483 [ [25](#b25-marinedrugs-08-01935)]. Despite the toxicity of G. catenatum and its wide distribution within most regions of the Mexican Pacific, there has been low monitoring effort, and probably many events have gone unnoticed. The increase in the reports of this species during last decades is probably due to the increased interest in HAB events of this species, and the number of colleagues researching HAB. In spite of being one of the most studied toxic dinoflagellate species in Mexico, there are still many research areas that have not been addressed, such as Mexico. We thank M.C.
