Diphtheria, tetanus, and thick covering in It can lead to breathing problems, painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw so his mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in up to 10 cases. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes coughing spells so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink, or breathe. These spells can last for weeks. It can lead to pneumonia, seizures (jerking and pertussis vaccine (DTaP) can help prevent these diseases. Most children who are vaccinated with DTaP will be protected throughout childhood. Many more would get these diseases if we stopped vaccinating. DTaP is safer version of an older vaccine called DTP. DTP is no longer used in the United States. 2 Who should get DTaP vaccine and when? Children should get 5 doses of DTaP vaccine, one dose at each of years DTaP may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some children should not get DTaP vaccine or should wait Children with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. But children who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting vaccine. Any child who allergic reaction after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose. Any child who suffered a brain or nervous system disease within 7 days after a dose of DTaP should not get another dose. Talk with your doctor if your child: - had a seizure or collapsed after a dose of DTaP,- cried non-stop for 3 hours or more after a dose of DTaP, - had a fever over 105\u00b0F after a dose of DTaP. Ask your doctor for more information. Some of these children should not get another dose of pertussis vaccine, but may get a vaccine without pertussis, called DT. 4 Older children and adults DTaP is not licensed for adolescents, adults, or children 7 years of age and older. But older people still need protection. A vaccine called Tdap is similar to DTaP. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for people 11 through 64 years of age. Another vaccine, called Td, protects against tetanus and diphtheria, but not pertussis. It is recommended every 10 years. There are separate Vaccine Information Statements for these vaccines. 5 What are causing serious problems, such risk DTaP serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Mild problems (common) Fever (up to about 1 child in 4) Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4) These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th doses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses. Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which the shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1 child in 30). Other mild problems include: Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3) Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10) V omiting (up to about 1 child in 50) These problems generally occur 1-3 days Seizure out of 14,000) Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000) High fever, over 105\u00b0F (about 1 child out of 16,000) Severe problems (very rare) Serious allergic reaction (less of a million other severe problems have been reported after seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine. Controlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is also important if another family member has had seizures. You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an aspirin-free pain reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following the package instructions. 6 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high or severe allergic reaction fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it severe reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 8 How can I learn more?

The Illinois Department of Health care and Fa mily Services ( HFS) reimburses providers for the administration of vaccine to Medicaid- enrolled children, but does not reimburse for the cost of the vaccines that ar e available through VFC Program . The VFC Program removes vaccine cost as a barrier to immunization for eligible children, reduces referral s to public clinics for immunization, and facilitates children remaining in a medical home for comprehensive care. The program promotes implementation of new vaccines recommended by the Centers for provides publicly -purchased vaccines from birth through enrolled (including Indian or Native Underinsured (only at Federally Qualified Health Centers) Section VFC parent s providers thousands vaccine.

In addition, the agreement requests information about all prescribing immunizations within the practice and general inform ation about the overall clinic . It is required that the physician with overall responsibility for the clinic 's use of VFC vaccine completes and sign s by the organization and its employed staff with the responsibilities outlined in the Provider physician's name should also be typed or printed the next to the signature. All enrolled providers are verified through HFS for eligibility to participate in the VFC Program . Medical license and National Provider I dentif ication (NPI) numbers must be submitted for this verification process. Every step of the VFC Program is intended to be as simple as possible for the provider, while ensuring that standards for eligibility and vaccine accountability are maintained. To enroll in the Chicago VFC Program, a provider is required to: 1. Com VFC handbook by signing and dating the Provider Agreement 3.

Providers maintain control of who they accept as patients. Therefore, a private health care provider is not required to accept a child into his or her practice merely because the child is eligible for VFC vac cines. To enroll in the Chicago VFC Program , a representative from the program will schedule a visit to the provider's site. This visit has three purposes: (1) t o provide information about VFC policies and procedures, (2) to inspect the refrigerators and freezers to be us ed for vaccine storage, and (3) to provide VFC training to the on- site designated Vaccine Coordinator and the back - up Vaccine Coordinator . The site visit the signed originals must follow before the first vaccine order is processed. If the documents are compl finalize the not at this should be mailed to the Chicago VFC Program, where they will be kept on file. The Provider Profile Form must be completed for individual public and private facilities approved by the Chicago VFC Program for participation in the VFC Program. The Provider Profile Form helps the Chicago VFC Program determine the amount of vaccine to be supplied through the program. This form is also used to Reenrollment (Recertificati on) The Chicago VFC Program providers annually use based on vaccines ordered the previous year by the provider.

Screening and Documenting Patient Eligibility Providers have the responsibility only are required to Patient Eligibility Screening Record on all VFC -eligible children. The screening record is typically included in the patient paper chart or Electronic Medical Record (EMR). The record can be maintained as a log if charts are not used, as in the case of mobile care vans. The records of screening must be maintained for a minimum period of three (3) years. Providers are required to screen all children and document the results from each screening at every immunization visit. This is because insurance coverage and Medicaid eligibility may change between heal th care visits.

This includes any act that constitutes fraud under federal or state law. 3\" Possible examples of the types of fraud that may occur with respect to the VFC Program may include, but are not limited to: 1. A health care provider bills Medicaid for administration reimbursement when no vaccines were given. A provider administer s VFC-supplied vaccine and then bills the child's private insurance company for the cost. 3. A provider charges a patient for the cost of the VFC - supplied vaccine. 4.

Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 18 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Vaccine Security and Equipment Maintenance It is important to routinely monitor that the vaccine storage unit is working properly in order to protect the vaccine supply. If the vaccine storage unit is not working properly, providers should refer to their clinic's emergency vaccine storage and handling plan and try to identify the cause of the problem. Below are a few basic ways to maintain the proper functioning of vaccine storage units and protect vaccines. 1. Do not use outl ets with built -in circuit switches (they have little reset buttons) for refrigerator/ freezers. 2. Avoid wall outlets that can be activated by a wall switch. 3. Use a safety -lock plug or an outlet cover to reduce the chance of the unit becoming inadvertently unplugged. Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 19 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK 4. Post a \"Do Not Unplug\" or \"Warning\" sign next to the outlet and on the electrical panel to warn people not to unplug or disconnect the refrigerator/freezers. A copy of the sign is available at the end of this section. 5. Limit access to the vaccine supply to authorized only. 6. Check that doors are properly sealed each time the door they are closed. 7. Providers with a large quantity of VFC vaccines should use a back -up generator in case of a major power failure. Use Certified Thermometers All refrigerator and freezer units that are used store VFC must be equipped with a certified and calibrated thermometer with a current certificate of calibration at all times. The Centers for Disease Control requires use of a certified, calibrated thermometer and a back -up thermometer in each storage unit used to store VFC vaccine. CDC requires sure that clinic staff understands how to r ead the thermometer (s) used thermometers have an easy -to-read screen o n which the temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit and/or Celsius. Some have optional features, including a display of the minimum and maximum temperatures, a temperature alarm that can be set to ring at a specified temperature, and a temperature probe in glycol Vaccine Management Section 4 - Page 20 (Rev. 01/20 14) CHICAGO DEPARTMENT O F PUBLIC HEALTH VACCINES FOR CHILDRE N PROVIDER HANDBOOK Digital Data Loggers Digital data loggers are small, battery -operated, electronic devices that may be programmed to record temperatures at intervals throughout the day. capable data loggers used in vaccine storage are accompanied by special software that is installed in a computer.

After a vaccine is licensed, VAERS is one of the mechanisms used to monitor any problems, or \"adverse events,\" happen after vaccination. Not all events reported are caused by the vaccine. Even though careful studies are done before a vaccine is licensed, rare adverse effects may not be found until a vaccine is given to millions of people with different backgrounds and medical histories. By continued monitoring, VAERS helps to make sure that far greater than risks. Anyone who receives a vaccine should or concerns should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always use the vaccine with the soonest expiration date first. Move vaccine with the soonest expiration date to the front of the storage unit and mark it to be used first. Keep vaccine vials in their original boxes. Store vaccine appropriately. Place vaccines in refrigerator or freezer immediately upon receiving Keep vaccine vials in their - aging. Place vaccine in clearly labeled wire baskets containers with a 2-3\" separation between baskets and from wall of unit. Separate vaccines that have been supplied from your state's Vaccines for Children program from vac - cines that are privately purchased. Do not store vaccines in the door or on the floor of the unit.Stabilize temperatures. Store ice packs in the freezer and large jugs of water in the refrigerator along with the vaccines. This will help maintain a stable, cold temperature in case of a power failure or if the re - frigerator or freezer doors are opened to temperature variations inside, which could affect vaccine efficacy. For this reason you should not store food or beverages in the refrigerator or freezer. Safeguard the electrical refrigerator and freezer are plugged into outlets in a protected area where they cannot be disconnected ac - cidentally. Label the refrigerator, freezer, electrical outlets, fuses, and circuit breakers on the power circuit with informa - tion that clearly identifies the perishable nature of vaccines and immediate steps to be taken in case of interruption of power. If your building has auxiliary power, use the outlet supplied refrigerator. Refer to package insert for specific instructions on the storage of each vaccine. If you have questions about the condition of the vaccine upon arrival, you should immediately place the vaccine in recommended storage, mark it \"do not use,\" and then call your state health department or the vaccine manufacturer(s) to determine whether the potency of the vaccine(s) has been affected. For other questions, call the immunization program at your state or local health department.

Additional sources of information and reference materials available on the internet are also included. Can patient records be reviewed by health department staff, or their contractual agents such as th e American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) or the Visiting Nurses Association (VNA), for the purpose of conducting AFIX provider site visits? Yes. Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, covered entities may health authorization to public health authorities that are authorized by law to collect such information for public health purposes. AFIX, authorized under section 317 of the Public Health Service Act, is a public health strategy to raise immunization co verage levels and improve standards providers, as covered entities, may share patient records with health department staff or their contractors because a health department is a public health authority authorized by law to review patient records for AFIX purposes, or because health department contractors are acting under a grant of authority from a public health authority. In addition, state health departments may have authority under applicable state law to collect t his information. Can patient records be reviewed by health officials or their agents for the purpose of conducting VFC provider site visits? Yes.

Under the VFC 42 1396s(c)(2), as a in the VFC program providers must share immunization records with health verif y compliance with VFC program requirements, including: 1. screening of all children in their practice to determine VFC eligibility; 2. to determine provider compliance with the provider with applicable State law, including any such law relating to any religious or other exemption; 4. to verify that VFC vaccine -eligible children are not being charged for the cost of the vaccine; 5. to verify that any administration fees caps established by CMS; 6. to verify that the provider does not deny administration of vaccine to vaccine -eligible children due to the inability of the child's parent to pay a n administration fee. Can health care providers, daycare operators, Head Start and school officials share immunization information with another provider or school to update missing immunization history or bring children into compliance with daycare, Head Start and school requirements? Health care providers (or other covered entities) may share immunization information with other health care providers as needed to make treatment decisions, further immunizations. Providers may also e immunization information to schools, without authorization, if permitted or required by State law. These State laws would not be preempted by the Privacy Rule. (45 CFR 160.203(c)). In the absence of such a State law, it appears that such disclosures to s chools will require individual authorization. Immunization records held by day care centers and schools are not protected health information under the Privacy Rule. Disclosures of immunization information by schools is covered by the Family Educational Rig hts and Privacy Act (FERPA). (45 CFR 164.501).

I-CARE, or Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange is an immunization record -sharing computer program developed by the Illinois Department of Public Health. The program allows public and private health care providers to share the immunization records of Illinois residents. Currently, the program contains more than 37 million immunization records. Besides keeping track of the immunizations a child on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pedi atrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians. What is the purpose of I -CARE? I-CARE is designed to help health care providers record, track and report their patients' immunizations. Participation The registry allows information about immunizations administered outside their practices. What is the goal of I -CARE? The primary goal of I -CARE is to increase the immunization coverage level of Illinois' 2 -year-olds to 90 percent. In 2008, approximatel Illinois' 2 -year-olds were properly immunized, according to a National Immunization Survey. While this goal focuses on 2 -year-olds, keep in mind that patients of all ages can be included in the I -CARE program. How does I -CARE work? I-CARE u sers can exchange data with the statewide registry in one of two ways: Electronic Data Interchange (coming soon) I-CARE Web -based computer program Electronic Data Interchange allows the sharing of electronic data in a structured HL7 (Health Level 7 stand ard) compatible format between computer programs. It allows health care facilities with their own HL7 compatible immunization tracking programs to share information with I -CARE. The I -CARE computer program is robust, allowing health care providers to colle ct, store, analyze and report immunization data at individual sites. Here are the main features of the computer program: Calculation of immunization due dates Print option for school physical form and patient immunization history report Remind/Recall fea ture to and notify patients of due Vaccine inventory feature due for shots Refrigerator/Freezer Temperature Log feature to track and report Report creation feature for several required forms and reports Information Statement module to update and print VIS forms and report What about security and patient information. Confidentiality is maintained through several security controls. Open access to the statewide registry is not allowed. Only registered I -CARE users have access to the data and information is available only on a need -to-know basis. In other words, I -CARE user cannot patient records. name or ID search crit eria must be used to access information in the statewide registry. An audit log at the statewide registry tracks all updates to patient records and which I -CARE user made each update. In addition, a site can only produce reports for patients seen at its cl inic site. What kind of equipment is needed to operate I -CARE? A high -speed Internet connection is needed to access the I -CARE Web site and Adobe Reader is used to open and print reports and forms. What if a patient does not want to participate in I -CARE? As of July 1, 2011, I -CARE switched from an opt -in to an opt -out registry . This change to the registry now requires health care providers using I -CARE to provide patient patient's parent/guardian with a printed immunization data exemption for m only once, prior to entering immunization records into I -CARE. The new \"opt -out\" registry will improve immunization data reporting by allowing physicians and health departments to enter all patient immunization data into the registry unless the patient information about the benefits of including their records on form supplement the \"opt-out\" is ng a new patient. This will provide the parent/patient with the necessary information I signing the \"opt -out\" form without reading it first. Keep in mind that any patient, of any age, can be included in your local I -CARE clinic, thereby allowing you to use the program's tracking for all of your patients. (Source: http://illinoisaap.org/2011/09/i -care-now-an-opt-out-registry/) How do I register to use I -CARE? Contact the Illin ois Department of Public Health if you would like to register for the I -CARE program. License agreements and other registration materials will be sent to you to complete and return. The department will then send you instructions to create a Web portal (Int ernet) account to access I -CARE. If you would like to register for I -CARE or if you have questions, please call the Department's Immunization Registry staff at 800 -526-4372 Staff are available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.

A (Minimum age: 12 months)Routine vaccination: Initiate vaccine series at 12 through 23 months; separate the 2 doses by 6 to 18 months. Children who have received 1 dose of HepA vaccine before age 24 months should receive a second dose 6 to 18 months after the first dose. For any person aged 2 years and older who has not already received the HepA vaccine series, 2 doses of HepA vaccine separated by 6 to 18 months may be administered if immunity against hepatitis is desired. Catch-up vaccination: The minimum interval doses 6 months. Special populations: Administer 2 doses of 6 months apart to previously unvaccinated who live in areas where vaccination programs target older children, or who are at increased risk for infection. This includes persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of infection; illicit persons who work with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory; persons with clotting-factor disorders; persons with chronic liver disease; and persons who anticipate close, personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity.

If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. 1. Is the child sick today? 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? 5. If the child to be vaccinated is between the ages of 2 and 4 years, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems? 8.

Is the person to be vaccinated pregnant or could she be - come pregnant within the next month? Pregnant women or women planning the inactivated injectable vaccine. 11. the person to be had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome? It is prudent to avoid vaccinating people who are not at high risk for severe influenza complications but who are known to have developed syndrome within receiving tion. As an might consider using influenza antiviral che - moprophylaxis for these people. Although data are limited, the established benefits of influenza vaccination for the majority of people who have a history of GBS, and who are at high risk for severe complications from influenza, justify yearly vaccination. 12. Does the person to be vaccinated live with or expect to have close contact with a person whose immune system is severely compromised and who must be in protective isolation (e.g., room of a unit)? Inactivated injectable influenza vaccine is preferred contact with a protective isolation (e.g., activated injectable influenza vaccine or LAIV may be used in people who have close contact with people having lesser degrees of immunosuppression. 13. Has the person to be vaccinated received any other vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? People who were given an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, varicella, zoster, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks should wait 28 days before receiving LAIV. There is no reason to defer giving LAIV if people were vac - cinated with an inactivated vaccine or if they have recently received blood or other antibody-containing blood products the person to be There is no evidence acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine acute have improved. Minor illnesses with or without fever do not contraindicate use of influenza vaccine. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2. Does person to be vaccinated have an allergy to eggs or to a component of the influenza vaccine? A history of anaphylactic or non-anaphylactic reaction\u2014such as tradename recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine (RIV) may be used in people age 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any severity who have no other contraindications. People with egg allergies who do not meet the age criteria for RIV can usually be vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV); consult ACIP recommendations (see source 3). For a complete list of vaccine components (i.e., excipients and culture media) used in the production of the vaccine, check the package insert (at www. immunize.org/ packageinserts) or go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/ appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf. 3.

Q1: Who decides what immunization schildren need ? A:Each year, t opdisease experts and doctors who care for children work together to decide what torecommend that will best protect U.S. c hildren from diseases. The schedule is evaluated needed. approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Q2: How are the timing is scheduled for the age when the body's immune system will work the be st. Second, it is balanced with the need to provide protection to infants and children at the earliest possible age. Q3: Why are there so many doses? A:Researchers are always studying how well vaccines work. For many vaccines three or four doses areneeded to full yprotect your child. The doses need tobe spaced out a certain amount to work the A:Your child's health and safety are important to your child's doctor. The schedule is considered the ideal schedule for healthy children but there may be exceptions. For example, your child might not receive certain vaccines if she has allergies to aningredient in the vaccine, or if she ha sa weakened immune system due to illness, a chronic condition, or medical treatment. Sometimes a shot needs to be delayed for a short time, and not given at all . Your pediatrician stays updated about newexceptions to the immunization schedule. This is one reason your child's complete medical history is taken at the pediatrician's office, and why it is important for your child's health care providers to be familiar with your child's medical history. Q5: Why can't the shots be spread out over a longer period of time? There are 25 shots recommended in of years? A: First, you would not want your child to go unprotected that long. Babies are hospitalized and die more often from some diseases, so it is important to vaccinate them as soon as it is safe. Second, the schedule is towork best with child's at certain ages and at specific times . There is no research to show that a child would beequally protected against diseases with a very different schedule . Also, there is reason why spreading out the shots would be safer. But we do know that any length of time without immunizations is a time without protection. Q6: I've seen another schedule in a magazine that allows the shots to be spread out. It was developed by a pediatrician. Why can't I follow that schedule? My child would still get his immunizations in time for school. A: There is no scientific basis for such a schedule . No one knows how well it would work to protect your child from diseases . And many more quickly .Also, people who are too sick or too young to receive vacc inesareplaced at risk when they are around unvaccinated children. For example, following one alternative schedule would leave children without full polio protection until age 4. Yet it would take only one case of polio to be brought into the U.S. for the disease to take hold again in this country. This schedule also delays the measles vaccine until age 3. already seen outbreaks of measles in some parts of the country because children were not immunized .This is a highly infectious disease that c ancause serious harm --even de ath. The reason we recommend vaccines when we do is because young children are more vulnerable to these diseases. Pediatricians want parents to have reliable, complete, and science -based information, so that they can make the best decision for their child about vaccination. Q7: Isn't it possible that my child has natural immunity to one or more diseases? If he does, can't he skip the shot? A:Tests for immunity to Isn't it overwhelming a child's give so many shots in one visit? A:Infants and children are exposed to many germs every day just by playing, eating, and breathing. Their immune systems fight those germs, also called anti gens, to keep the body healthy. The amount of antigens that children fight every day is much more than the antigens in any combination of vaccines on the current schedule. children's immune systems are not overwhelmed by vaccines. Q9: There are no sho ts given at 9 months, other than maybe flu vaccine or catch -up vaccines. W hynotgive some at that visit instead of at 6 months or 12 months? A: Waiting until 9 from some diseases , but 9 months is too early for some of the12-18 month vaccines .For example, i t is too the live measles, mumps, rubella and varicella ofprotection from their mother during the pregnancy, and could make the vacc . contained should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician. There may be variations in treatment that your pediatrician may recommend based on individual facts and of Pediatrics, October 2008 Questions and Answers about Vaccine Ingredients Q. What ingredients are in vaccines? A. All vaccines contain antigens. Antigens make a vaccine is chosen because studies show it is the best way a particular infection. Antigen forms include: They form of the disease, but the body still recognizes virus and creates and immune response to protect itself. In the United States, t he polio, hepatitis A, influenza and rabies vaccines contain inactivated v iruses. Partial viruses. These are made up of the specific part of the dead virus that will prompt a protective immune response. Some vaccines are made including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines. Partial bacteria. These are made up of the specifi c part of the dead bacteria that will prompt a protective immune response. Some and more effective. They Preservatives They help the immune response. These are aluminum salts . Additives. They production process. Some ingredients are needed to make the vaccine. Although these ingredients are removed, tiny (resi dual) amounts are left in the final product. Depending on how the vaccine is made, it may include tiny amounts of antibiotics (neomycin), egg protein, or Q. Are these other ingredients in vaccines safe? A. Yes. Q. Why are these other ingred in vaccines? A. Each ingredient has a specific function in a vaccine. These ingredients have been studied and are safe for humans in the vaccines. This amount is much less than children encounter in their environment, food and water. Aluminum salts. Aluminum salts help your body create a better immune response to vaccines. Aluminum salts are necessary to make some of the vaccines we use more effective. Without an adjuvant like aluminum, people could need more doses of shots to be protected. Everyone is exposed to aluminum because there is much aluminum in the earth's crust. It's present in our food, air and water, including breast milk and formula. The amount of aluminum in vaccines is similar to that found in 33 ounces of infant form ula. Aluminum has been used and studied in vaccines for 75 years to inactivate a virus. The tiny amount which may be left in these vaccines is safe. Vaccines ar e not the only source of formaldehyde your baby is exposed to. Formaldehyde is also in products like paper towels, mascara and Our bodies normally present in some vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination when the vaccine is made. Trace amounts antibiotics Egg protein. Influenza and yellow fever vaccines are produc ed in eggs, so egg proteins are present in the final product and can cause allergic reaction . Measles and eggs. The much the MMR mumps, rubella) vaccine does not usually cause allergic children. Gelatin. Some vaccines contain gelatin skin creams and toothpaste) is used in vaccines an d is safe. It is used to inactivate the influenza virus in some influenza vaccines. It is also used any mercury. Methylmercury, which is found in fis h and other animals (including humans) can be toxic and lead in a form of mercury called ethylmercury, whic is processed by the body very differently than methylmercury, and is not associated with the same adverse effects . It is still present in some influenza vaccines. Thimerosal is still used in the manufacture of some vaccines to prevent contamination. The thimerosal is removed at the end of the manufacturing process. In some cases, a tiny amount of thimerosal remains. The remaining amount is so small, that it is not possible for it to have any effect. Valid scientific studies have shown there is no link bet ween thimerosal and autism. In fact, autism thimerosal childhood vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) agree that science does not support a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. For the IOM report, go to http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3793/4705/4717.aspx . Q. Do vaccines contain fetal tissue? A. No. vaccines viruses the 1960s . The fetuses were ab orted medical for the purpose of producing These cell lines have aborted fetuses are ever used No fetal tissue is included in the vaccines, either, so children are not injected with any part of an aborted fetus. Q. in vaccines is very small. In fact, we are exposed to much higher levels of these chemicals in our everyday lives. In vaccines, these ingredients are used t o make the vaccine safer and more effective. Each vaccine is tested many times to make sure it is safe and works. Taking ingredients out might affect the ability of the vaccine to protect a child. Research is always being done to make sure that the ingredi ents in vaccines continue to be the safest and best available for children.

La difteria y la tos ferina pasan de una persona a otra. El t\u00e9tano entra al cuerpo por cortadas o heridas. LA DIFTERIA causa un recubrimiento espeso en la parte posterior de la garganta. Esto puede causar problemas respiratorios, par\u00e1lisis, fallo card\u00edaco y hasta la muerte. EL T\u00c9TANO causa espasmos dolorosos de los m\u00fasculos, por lo general en todo el cuerpo. Puede causar \"trabadura\" de la mand\u00edbula, de modo que la v\u00edctima no puede abrir la boca ni tragar. El t\u00e9tano es mortal en hasta 2 de cada 10 casos. LA TOS FERINA (Pertusis) produce ataques de tos tan intensos que a los beb\u00e9s les resulta dif\u00edcil comer, beber o respirar. Estos ataques pueden durar semanas. Puede causar neumon\u00eda, convulsiones (ataques de sacudidas del cuerpo y fijaci\u00f3n de la mirada), da\u00f1o al cerebro y la muerte. La vacuna contra la difteria, el t\u00e9tano y la tos ferina (DTaP) puede ayudar a prevenir estas enfermedades. La mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os que reciben la vacuna DTaP estar\u00e1n protegidos durante toda la ni\u00f1ez. Si dej\u00e1ramos de vacunarlos, muchos m\u00e1s ni\u00f1os tendr\u00edan estas enfermedades. La vacuna DTaP es una versi\u00f3n m\u00e1s segura de una vacuna m\u00e1s vieja llamada DTP. La DTP se ha dejado de usar en los Estados Unidos. Los ni\u00f1os deben recibir 5 dosis de la vacuna contra DTaP, una dosis en cada una de las siguientes edades. A los: 2 meses 4 meses 6 meses 15-18 meses 4-6 a\u00f1os La DTaP se puede dar al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas.LO QUE USTED NECESITA SABER \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 vacunarse?1 Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis - Spanish 5/17/2007DIFTERIA T\u00c9TANO Y TOS FERINA La vacuna DTaP no est\u00e1 autorizada para adolescentes, adultos ni ni\u00f1os de 7 a\u00f1os de edad y mayores. Pero las personas mayores tambi\u00e9n necesitan protecci\u00f3n. Existe una vacuna llamada Tdap, que es similar a la DTaP. Se recomienda una sola dosis de la vacuna Tdap para las personas de 11 a 64 a\u00f1os de edad. Otra vacuna, llamada Td, protege contra el t\u00e9tano y la difteria, pero no contra la tos ferina. Se recomienda cada 10 a\u00f1os. Cada una de estas vacunas tiene su propia Hoja de Informaci\u00f3n sobre la Vacuna.\u00bfQui\u00e9nes deben vacunarse contra la DTaP, y cu\u00e1ndo?2Algunas personas no deben recibir la DTaP, o deben esperar3 Ni\u00f1os de mayor edad y adultos4 Los ni\u00f1os con enfermedades leves, como un resfr\u00edo, se pueden vacunar. Pero los ni\u00f1os que est\u00e1n moderadamente o muy enfermos por lo general deben esperar hasta recuperarse para vacunarse. Todos los ni\u00f1os que tuvieron una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica que puso en peligro su vida despu\u00e9s de una dosis de la DTaP no deben recibir otra. Todos los ni\u00f1os que sufrieron una enfermedad del cerebro o del sistema nervioso dentro de los 7 d\u00edas de haber recibido una dosis de la DTaP no deben recibir otra. Hable con su doctor si su hijo: - tuvo convulsiones o sufri\u00f3 un colapso despu\u00e9s de una dosis de la DTaP - llor\u00f3 sin parar 3 horas o m\u00e1s despu\u00e9s de una dosis de la DTaP - tuvo fiebre de m\u00e1s de 105\u00baF despu\u00e9s de una dosis de la DTaP. Pida m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n a su profesional de la salud. Algunos de estos ni\u00f1os no deben recibir otra dosis de la vacuna contra la tos ferina, pero pueden recibir una vacuna sin tos ferina llamada DT. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son los riesgos de la vacuna DTaP?

Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HA V). HA V is found in the stool of people with hepatitis A. It is usually spread by close personal contact and some\u00ad times by eating food or drinking water containing HA V . A person who has hepatitis A can easily pass the disease to others within the same household. Hepatitis A can cause: \"fl u-like\" illness pains and diarrhea (children) People with hepatitis A often have to be hospitalized (up to about 1 person in 5). Adults with hepatitis A are often too ill to work for up to a month. Sometimes, people die as a result of hepatitis A (about 3-6 deaths per 1,000 cases). Hepatitis A vaccine can prevent hepatitis A. 2 Who should get hepatitis A vaccine and when? WHO? Some people should be routinely vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine: All children between their rst and second birthdays (12 through 23 months of age). Anyone 1 year of age and older traveling to or working in countries with high or intermediate prevalence of hepatitis A, such as those located in Central or South America, Mexico, Asia (except Japan), Africa, and eastern Europe. For more information see www.cdc.gov/travel. Children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age who live in states or communities where routine vaccination has been implemented because of high disease incidence. Men who have sex with men. People who use street drugs. People with chronic liver disease. People who are treated with clotting factor concentrates. People who work with HA V-infected primates or who work with HA V in research laboratories. Members of households planning to adopt a child, or care for a newly arriving adopted child, from a country where hepatitis A is common. Other people might get hepatitis A vaccine in certain situations (ask your doctor for more details): Unvaccinated children or adolescents in communities where outbreaks of hepatitis A are occurring. Unvaccinated people who have been exposed to hepatitis A virus. Anyone 1 year of age or older who wants protection from hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccine is not licensed for children younger than 1 year of age. WHEN? For children , the rst dose should be given at 12 through 23 months of age. Children who are not vacci\u00ad nated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at later visits. For others at risk, the hepatitis A vaccine series may be started whenever a person wishes to be protected or is at risk of infection. For travelers , it is best to start the vaccine series at least one month before traveling. (Some protection may still result if the vaccine is given on or closer to the travel date.) Some people who cannot get the vaccine before traveling, or for whom the vaccine might not be effective, can get (IG). IG gives immediate, temporary vaccine lasting protection. These doses should be given at 6 months apart. Hepatitis A vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get hepatitis A vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had allergic to a previous dose A vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies, including a severe allergy to latex. All hepatitis who is moderately or shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant. Because hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated (killed), the risk to a pregnant woman or her unborn baby is believed to be very low. But your doctor can weigh any theoretical risk from the vaccine against the need for protection. 4 What are the risks fromhepatitis A vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of hepatitis A vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting hepatitis A vaccine given (about 1 out of 2 adults, and up to 1 out of 6 children) headache (about 1 out of 6 adults and 1 out of 25 children) loss of appetite (about 1 out of 12 children) tiredness (about 1 out of 14 adults) If these problems occur, they usually last 1 or 2 days. Severe problems serious allergic reaction, within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot (very rare). 5 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? What should I look for? as a high fever or behavior. serious beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov , or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does advice. 6 The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about ling a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 7 How can I learn more?

La hepatitis A es una enfermedad hep\u00e1tica grave provocada por el virus de la hepatitis A (VHA). El VHA se encuentra en las heces de las personas infectadas con hepatitis A. Normalmente se contagia por contacto personal cercano y, a veces, al ingerir alimentos o agua que contienen el VHA. Una persona que tiene hepatitis A puede contagiar f\u00e1cilmente la enfermedad a otras personas que conviven con ella en la misma casa. La hepatitis A puede provocar: enfermedad \"similar a la gripe\" ictericia (coloraci\u00f3n amarilla en la piel o los ojos, orina de color oscuro) dolores de est\u00f3mago y diarrea severos (ni\u00f1os) Las personas con hepatitis A a menudo deben ser hospitalizadas (alrededor de 1 de cada 5 personas). Los adultos con hepatitis A a menudo se sienten demasiado enfermos como para trabajar durante hasta un mes. A veces, las personas mueren como resultado de la hepatitis A (alrededor de 3 a 6 muertes cada 1000 casos). La vacuna contra la hepatitis A puede prevenir la hepatitis A.Las hojas de informaci\u00f3n sobre vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en muchos otros idiomas.

Una vacuna, como cualquier medicamento, puede provocar problemas graves, como reacciones al\u00e9rgicas severas. Sin embargo, el riesgo de que la vacuna contra la hepatitis A ocasione un da\u00f1o grave, o la muerte, es casi insignificante. Vacunarse contra la hepatitis A es mucho m\u00e1s seguro que contraer la enfermedad. Problemas leves dolor en el lugar donde se puso la inyecci\u00f3n (alrededor de 1 de cada 2 adultos, y hasta 1 de cada 6 ni\u00f1os) dolor de cabeza (alrededor de 1 de cada 6 adultos y 1 de cada 25 ni\u00f1os) p\u00e9rdida del apetito (alrededor de 1 de cada 12 ni\u00f1os) cansancio (alrededor de 1 de cada 14 adultos) Si estos problemas ocurren, normalmente duran entre 1 y 2 d\u00edas.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States. More than half of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some time in their lives. About 20 million Americans are currently infected, and about 6 million more get infected each year. HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. Most HPV infections don't cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths among women around the world. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it. HPV is also associated with less common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. There is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the problems it causes can be treated. 2 HPV vaccine - Why get vaccinated? HPV vaccine is important because it can prevent most cases of cervical cancer in females, if it is given before a person is exposed to the virus. Protection from HPV vaccine is expected to be long-lasting. But vaccination is not a substitute for cervical cancer screening. Women should still get regular Pap tests. The vaccine you are getting is one of two vaccines that can be given to prevent HPV. It may be given to both males and females. In addition to preventing cancer, and and anal cancer in both males and females. The other vaccine is given to females only for prevention of cervical cancer. 3 Routine Vaccination HPV vaccine is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age. It may be given to girls starting at age 9. Why is HPV vaccine given to girls at this age? It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before their rst sexual contact - because they won't have been exposed to human papillomavirus. Once a girl or woman has been infected with the virus, the vaccine might not work as well or might not work at all. Females: Catch-Up Vaccination The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age who did not get all 3 doses when they were younger. Males Males 9 through 26 years of age may get HPV vaccine. As with females, it is best to be vaccinated before the rst sexual contact. HPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series 1st Dose Now 2nd Dose 1 to 2 after Dose 1 3rd Dose 6 months after Dose 1 Additional (booster) doses are not recommended. HPV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 4 Some people should not get HPV vaccine or should wait Anyone who ever life-threatening allergic reaction to component a previous dose of HPV vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting vaccinated has any severe allergies, What are risks from this vaccine? HPV is not women. However, receiving HPV vaccine when not a reason consider terminating the pregnancy. Women who are breast feeding may get the vaccine. Any woman who learns she was pregnant when she got this HPV vaccine is encouraged to contact the manufacturer's HPV in pregnancy registry at 800-986-8999. This will help us learn how pregnant women respond to the vaccine. People who are mildly ill when a dose of HPV vaccine is planned can still be vaccinated. with a moderate or severe illness should wait until they are better. This HPV vaccine has been used in the U.S. and around the world for several years and has been very safe. However, any medicine could possibly cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine causing a injury, or death, is extremely small. Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it would be within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. Several mild to moderate problems are known to occur with HPV vaccine. These do not last long and go away on their own. Reactions in the arm where the shot was given: - Pain (about 8 people in 10) - Redness or swelling (about 1 person in 4) Fever: - Mild (100\u00b0 F) (about 1 person in 10) - Moderate (102\u00b0 F) (about 1 person in 65) Other problems: - Headache (about 1 including vaccination.

Pero el HPV puede causar c\u00e1ncer del cuello del \u00fatero en las mujeres. El c\u00e1ncer del cuello del \u00fatero es la segunda causa principal de muertes por c\u00e1ncer entre las mujeres del mundo. En Estados Unidos, cerca de 10,000 mujeres contraen c\u00e1ncer del cuello del \u00fatero todos los a\u00f1os y se espera que unas 4,000 mueran a causa de \u00e9l. El HPV tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 asociado a varios c\u00e1nceres menos comunes, como el c\u00e1ncer de la vagina y de la vulva en las mujeres y a otros tipos de c\u00e1nceres en hombres y mujeres. Tambi\u00e9n puede causar verrugas genitales y verrugas en la garganta. La infecci\u00f3n por el HPV no tiene cura, pero algunos de los problemas que causa se pueden tratar. La vacuna contra el HPV, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 vacunarse?2Mujeres: Vacunaci\u00f3n de rutina La vacuna contra el HPV se recomienda para las ni\u00f1as de 11 \u00f3 12 a\u00f1os de edad. Se puede dar a ni\u00f1as a partir de los 9 a\u00f1os de edad. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se aplica la vacuna contra el HPV a ni\u00f1as a estas edades? Es importante que las ni\u00f1as se vacunen contra el HPV antes de su primer contacto sexual, porque no habr\u00e1n estado expuestas al virus del papiloma humano. Una vez que una ni\u00f1a o una mujer ha sido infectada por el virus es posible que la vacuna no funcione tan bien o que no funcione en absoluto. Mujeres: Vacunaci\u00f3n para ponerse al d\u00eda La vacuna tambi\u00e9n se recomienda para ni\u00f1as y mujeres de 13 a 26 a\u00f1os de edad que no recibieron las 3 dosis completas cuando eran m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes. Varones y Hombres Los varones y hombres de 9 a 26 a\u00f1os de edad pueden vacunarse contra el HPV para prevenir verrugas genitales. Al igual que en las mujeres, es mejor vacunarse antes del primer contacto sexual. La vacuna contra el HPV se da en una serie de 3 dosis 1\u00aa dosis Ahora 2\u00aa dosis 1 a 2 meses despu\u00e9s de la 1\u00aa dosis 3\u00aa dosis 6 meses despu\u00e9s de la 1\u00aa dosis No se recomiendan dosis adicionales (de refuerzo).

More than half of sexually active men and women are infected with HPV at some time in their lives . About 20 million Americans are currently infected, and about 6 million more get infected each year. HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. Most HPV infections don't cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths among women around theworld. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it. HPV is also associated with less common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat. There is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the problems it causes can treated. HPV vaccine - Why get vaccinated?2Routine Vaccination HPV vaccine is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age . It may be given to girls starting at age 9. Why is HPV vaccine given to girls at this age? It is important for girls to get HPV vaccine before their rst sexual contact - because they won't have been exposed to human papillomavirus. Once a girl or woman has been infected with the virus, the vaccine might not work as well or might not work at all. Catch-Up Vaccination The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age who did not get all 3 doses when they were younger. HPV vaccine is given as a 3-dose series 1st Now 2nd Dose 1 to 2 after Dose 1 3rd Dose 6 months after Dose 1 Additional (booster) doses are not recommended.

Moderate problems: Young children who get inactivated fl u vaccine and pneu- mococcal vaccine (PCV13) at the same time appear to be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information. Tell your doctor if a child who is getting fl u vaccine allergic are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. In 1976, a type of inactivated in fl uenza fl u) then, fl clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current fl u vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe in fl uenza, which prevented by Injury Compensation Program (VICP) was created in 1986. People who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about ling a claim by fl vaccine, called A fl uria, should not be given to children 8 years of age or younger, except in special circumstances. A related vaccine was associated with fevers and fever-related seizures in young children in Australia. Your doctor can give you more information.The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

Es causada por el virus de la influenza, que se puede transmitir al toser, estornudar o mediante las secreciones nasales. A cualquiera le puede dar influenza, pero los \u00edndices de infec - ci\u00f3n son mayores entre los ni\u00f1os. La mayor\u00eda de las personas solo experimentan s\u00edntomas por unos pocos d\u00edas e incluyen: fiebre/escalofr\u00edos dolor de garganta tos dolores musculares cansancio dolor de cabeza nariz moquienta o congestionada Otras enfermedades pueden tener los mismos s\u00edntomas y a menudo se confunden con la influenza. Los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, las personas mayores de 65 a\u00f1os de edad, las mujeres embarazadas y las personas con ciertas condiciones de salud, como enfermedades del coraz\u00f3n, pulm\u00f3n o ri\u00f1\u00f3n o un sistema inmunol\u00f3gico debilitado, se pueden enfermar mucho m\u00e1s. La influenza puede causar fiebre alta y neumon\u00eda y puede empeorar condiciones de salud preexistentes. Puede causar diarrea y convulsiones en los ni\u00f1os. Miles de personas mueren cada a\u00f1o por la influenza y muchas m\u00e1s requieren hospitalizaci\u00f3n. Si se vacuna, puede protegerse usted mismo y evitar contagiar a otros. \u00bfQui\u00e9nes deben recibir la vacuna desactivada contra la influenza y cu\u00e1ndo?3 Hay dos tipos de vacuna contra la influenza: 1. La vacuna desactivada (virus muerto), o \"vacuna contra la influenza\" que se inyecta en el m\u00fasculo. 2. La vacuna viva atenuada (debilitada), que se aplica como roc\u00edo en las fosas nasales. Esta vacuna se describe en una Hoja de Informaci\u00f3n sobre las Vacunas, por separado. Hay una \"dosis m\u00e1s alta\" de vacuna desactivada disponible para personas mayores de 65 a\u00f1os. Para m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n, consulte a su doctor. Cada a\u00f1o los cient\u00edficos tratan de que los virus de la vacuna coincidan con los que tienen m\u00e1s probabilidades de causar la influenza ese a\u00f1o. La vacuna contra la influenza no prevendr\u00e1 otras enfermedades causadas por otros virus, inclu- yendo los virus de influenza que no est\u00e1n incluidos en la vacuna. Despu\u00e9s de la vacunaci\u00f3n, toma hasta 2 semanas para desarro- llar protecci\u00f3n. La protecci\u00f3n dura hasta un a\u00f1o. Algunas vacunas desactivadas contra la influenza contienen un conservante llamado timerosal. La vacuna libre de timerosal tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 disponible. Consulte a su doctor para m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n. QUI\u00c9NES Todas las personas mayores de 6 meses de edad deben recibir la vacuna contra la influenza. La vacunaci\u00f3n es especialmente importante para las personas con mayor riesgo de experimentar un caso grave de influenza y las que est\u00e1n en contacto directo con ellas, incluyendo al personal m\u00e9dico, y las personas en contacto cercano con beb\u00e9s menores de 6 meses de edad. CU\u00c1NDOReciba la vacuna tan pronto como est\u00e9 disponible. Esto le dar\u00e1 la protecci\u00f3n necesaria en caso de que la temporada de influenza llegue temprano. Puede vacunarse durante todo el tiempo en el que la enfermedad siga ocurriendo en su comunidad. La influenza puede ocurrir a cualquier momento, pero la mayor\u00eda de influenza ocurre desde octubre hasta mayo. En las \u00faltimas temporadas, la mayor\u00eda de las infecciones han ocurrido en enero y febrero. Vacun\u00e1ndose en diciembre, o a\u00fan despu\u00e9s, ser\u00e1 bene-ficioso en casi todos los a\u00f1os. Los adultos y los ni\u00f1os mayores requieren una dosis de la va - cuna contra la influenza cada a\u00f1o. Sin embargo, algunos ni\u00f1os menores de 9 a\u00f1os de edad necesitan dos dosis para estar prote - gidos. Consulte a su doctor. Se puede dar la vacuna contra la influenza a la misma vez que otras vacunas, incluyendo la vacuna antineumoc\u00f3cica.Hojas de Informaci\u00f3n sobre las Vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en muchos otros idiomas.

El riesgo de que la vacuna cause un da\u00f1o serio, o la muerte, es sumamente peque\u00f1o. Problemas serios de la vacuna desactivada contra la influenza ocurren muy rara vez. Los virus en la vacuna desactivada est\u00e1n muertos o sea que no se puede enfermar de influenza mediante la vacuna. Problemas leves: molestia, hinchaz\u00f3n o enrojecimiento o en el lugar donde lo vacunaron ronquera; dolor, enrojecimiento y picaz\u00f3n en los ojos; tos fiebre dolores dolor de cabeza picaz\u00f3n cansancio Si estos problemas ocurren, en general comienzan poco tiempo despu\u00e9s de vacunarse y duran 1 \u00f3 2 d\u00edas. Problemas moderados: Los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os que reciben la vacuna contra la influenza desactivada y la vacuna antineumoc\u00f3cica (PCV13) durante la misma cita parecen correr mayor riego de tener convulsiones por causa de fiebre. Consulte a su doctor para m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n. Diga a su doctor si el ni\u00f1o que est\u00e1 recibiendo la vacuna contra la influenza ha tenido una convulsi\u00f3n. Problemas graves: Las reacciones al\u00e9rgicas que amenazan la vida ocurren muy rara vez despu\u00e9s de la vacunaci\u00f3n. Si ocurren, por lo general es a los pocos minutos o a las pocas horas de haberse vacunado. En 1976, un tipo de la vacuna desactivada contra la influenza (gripe porcina) estuvo asociado al s\u00edndrome de Guillain-Barr\u00e9 (GBS). Desde entonces, las vacunas contra la influenza no se han asociado claramente al GBS. Sin embargo, si hay un riesgo de GBS por las vacunas contra la influenza que se usan actualmente, no debe ser de m\u00e1s de 1 \u00f3 2 casos por mill\u00f3n de personas vacunadas. Eso es mucho menor que el riesgo de tener una influenza fuerte, que se puede prevenir con vacunaci\u00f3n .Programa Nacional de Com- pensaci\u00f3n por Lesiones Causa-das por las Vacunas7 El Programa Nacional de Compensaci\u00f3n por Lesiones Causadas por las Vacunas (VICP) fue creado en 1986.

Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and the spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who live, another 11%-19% lose their arms or legs, have problems with their systems, become deaf or mentally retarded, suffer seizures or strokes. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most common in infants less than one year of age and people 16-21 years. Children with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen, increased of getting meningococcal with drugs such as penicillin. Still, many people who get the disease die from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. 2 Meningococcal vaccine There are two kinds of vaccine in U.S.: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4) is the preferred vaccine people 55 years of age and younger. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( MPSV4) has been available since 1970s. It is the only meningo- coccal vaccine licensed for people older than prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. There are other types of meningococcal disease; the vaccines do not protect against get and doses of MCV4 are recommended for adolescents 11 through 18 years of age: the rst dose at 11 or 12 years of age, with a booster dose at age 16. Adolescents in this age group with HIV infection should get three doses: 2 doses 2 months apart at 11 or 12 years, plus a booster at age 16. If the rst dose (or series) is given between 13 and 15 years of age, the booster should be given between 16 and 18. If the rst dose (or series) is given after the 16th birthday, a booster is not needed. Other People at Increased Risk College freshmen living in dormitories. Laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to meningococcal bacteria. U.S. military recruits. Anyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the world where meningococcal disease is common, such as parts of People have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak. Children between 9 and 23 months of age, and anyone else with certain medical conditions need 2 doses for adequate protection. Ask your doctor about the number and timing of doses, and the need for booster doses. MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people in these groups who are 9 months through 55 years of age. MPSV4 can be used for adults older than 55. 4 Some people should not get meningococcal vaccine or should wait. not get dose of vaccine. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who is moderately or severely shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women. MCV4 is a fairly new vaccine and has not been studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4 has. It should be Except for children with sickle cell disease without a working spleen, meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 5 What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal often adolescents, and they can result in falls and injuries. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after getting the shot - especially if you feel faint - can help prevent these injuries. Mild problems As many as half the who meningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, was given. If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people a mild fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. 6 What if there is a moderate orsevere reaction? What should a a severe allergic reaction occurred, it would be within a few minutes to an hour after the shot. Signs of or swelling of the throat. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form.

Es una de las causas principales de meningitis bacteriana en ni\u00f1os de 2 a 18 a\u00f1os en los Estados Unidos. La meningitis es una infecci\u00f3n de las membranas que cubren el cerebro y la m\u00e9dula espinal. La enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica tambi\u00e9n causa infecciones de la sangre En los Estados Unidos, aproximadamente entre 1,000 y 1,200 personas por a\u00f1o contraen la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica. Entre el 10% y el 15% de ellas mueren, incluso si se las tratan con antibi\u00f3ticos. De las que sobreviven, entre el 11% y el 19% pierden los brazos o las piernas, presentan problemas en el sistema nervioso, quedan sordas o con retraso mental, o sufren convulsiones o derrames cerebrales. Cualquiera puede contraer la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica, pero es m\u00e1s com\u00fan en beb\u00e9s de menos de un a\u00f1o y en personas entre 16 y 21 a\u00f1os. Los ni\u00f1os con ciertos problemas m\u00e9dicos, como la falta de bazo, tienen mayor riesgo de contraer la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica. El riesgo tambi\u00e9n es mayor en estudiantes universitarios de primer a\u00f1o que viven en residencias estudiantiles. Las infecciones meningoc\u00f3cicas se pueden tratar con medicamentos como la penicilina. Aun as\u00ed, muchas personas que contraen la enfermedad mueren a causa de ella y muchas otras quedan afectadas de por vida. Por eso, la prevenci\u00f3n de la enfermedad a trav\u00e9s de la vacuna contra el meningococo es importante para las personas con mayor riesgo.Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages.

Visite http://www.immunize.org/vis 1\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica? Existen dos tipos de vacuna contra el meningococo en los Estados Unidos: La vacuna conjugada contra el meningococo (MCV4) se recomienda para personas menores de 55 a\u00f1os. La vacuna polisac\u00e1rida contra el meningococo (MPSV4) ha estado disponible desde los a\u00f1os setenta. Es la \u00fanica vacuna contra el meningococo autorizada para personas mayores de 55 a\u00f1os. Ambas vacunas pueden prevenir 4 tipos de enfermedades meningoc\u00f3cicas, incluyendo 2 de los 3 tipos m\u00e1s comunes en los Estados Unidos y un tipo que causa epidemias en \u00c1frica. Existen otros tipos de enfermedades meningoc\u00f3cicas, pero las vacunas no protegen contra ellos. 3\u00bfQui\u00e9n debe ponerse la vacuna contra el meningococo y cu\u00e1ndo? Vacunaci\u00f3n de rutina Se recomiendan dos dosis de MCV4 para los adolescentes de 11 a 18 a\u00f1os: la primera dosis a los 11 \u00f3 12 a\u00f1os, con una dosis de refuerzo a los 16 a\u00f1os. Los adolescentes en este grupo de edad con infecci\u00f3n de VIH se deben poner tres dosis: 2 dosis con 2 meses de diferencia a los 11 \u00f3 12 a\u00f1os, m\u00e1s un refuerzo a los 16. Si la primera dosis (o serie) se pone entre los 13 y 15 a\u00f1os, el refuerzo se debe poner entre los 16 y los 18 a\u00f1os. Si la primera dosis (o serie) se pone despu\u00e9s de cumplir los 16 a\u00f1os, no se necesita un refuerzo. Otras personas con mayor riesgo Estudiantes universitarios de primer a\u00f1o que viven en residencias estudiantiles. Personal de laboratorio que est\u00e1 expuesto habitualmente a la bacteria meningoc\u00f3cica. Reclutas militares de los Estados Unidos. Cualquier persona que viaje a cualquier parte del mundo donde la enfermedad meningoc\u00f3cica sea com\u00fan, como en algunas partes de \u00c1frica, o que viva en tales zonas. Cualquier persona cuyo bazo est\u00e9 da\u00f1ado o se le haya extirpado. Cualquier persona que tenga una deficiencia del complejo terminal del complemento (un trastorno del sistema inmunitario). Personas que podr\u00edan haber estado expuestas a meningitis durante un brote. Los ni\u00f1os entre 9 y 23 meses y cualquier otra persona con ciertas afecciones m\u00e9dicas necesitan 2 dosis para tener una protecci\u00f3n adecuada. Pregunte a su m\u00e9dico sobre la cantidad de dosis y el momento en que se deben aplicar, y la necesidad de dosis de refuerzo. La MCV4 es la recomendada para las personas entre 9 meses y 55 a\u00f1os que se encuentran en estos grupos. La MPSV4 se puede usar en adultos mayores de 55 a\u00f1os.4Algunas personas no se deben poner la vacuna contra el meningococo o deben esperar. 5\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los riesgos relacionados con las vacunas contra el meningococo? Al igual que cualquier medicamento, las vacunas podr\u00edan causar graves problemas, como reacciones al\u00e9rgicas graves. El riesgo de que la vacuna contra el meningococo provoque da\u00f1os graves, o la muerte, es sumamente bajo. Problemas leves La mitad de las personas que se ponen las vacunas contra el meningococo tienen efectos secundarios leves, como enrojecimiento o dolor en el lugar de la inyecci\u00f3n. Si se producen estos problemas, por lo general duran 1 \u00f3 2 d\u00edas. Son m\u00e1s comunes despu\u00e9s de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la MCV4 que de la MPSV4. Un peque\u00f1o porcentaje de las personas que reciben la vacuna presentan un poco de fiebre. Problemas graves Las reacciones al\u00e9rgicas, despu\u00e9s de unos minutos o unas horas de ponerse la vacuna, son muy poco frecuentes.6\u00bfQu\u00e9 sucede si se produce una reacci\u00f3n moderada o grave? 7Programa Nacional de Compensaci\u00f3n por Da\u00f1os Derivados de Vacunas El Programa Nacional de Compensaci\u00f3n por Da\u00f1os Derivados de Vacunas (VICP) se cre\u00f3 en 1986.

Las personas que tenga una alergia grave (que ponga en peligro su vida) a cualquier componente de la vacuna no deben ponerse la vacuna. Informe a su m\u00e9dico si tiene alergias graves. Las personas que tengan una enfermedad moderada o grave al momento de ponerse la vacuna deben esperar hasta recuperarse. Pregunte a su m\u00e9dico. Las personas con una enfermedad leve generalmente se pueden vacunar. Las vacunas contra el meningococo pueden aplicarse a mujeres embarazadas. La MCV4 es una vacuna bastante nueva y no se ha estudiado tanto en mujeres embarazadas como la MPSV4. Se debe emplear solo en casos claramente necesarios. Los fabricantes de MCV4 mantienen registros de las mujeres embarazadas que reciben la vacuna. A excepci\u00f3n de los ni\u00f1os con anemia de c\u00e9lulas falciformes o que no tienen un bazo funcional, las vacunas contra el meningococo se pueden aplicar al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas. Despu\u00e9s de una vacunaci\u00f3n, pueden ocurrir episodios de desmayo de corta duraci\u00f3n y s\u00edntomas relacionados (como espasmos o movimientos similares a una convulsi\u00f3n). Estos suceden m\u00e1s a menudo en adolescentes y pueden provocar ca\u00eddas y lesiones. Sentarse o recostarse por unos 15 minutos despu\u00e9s de obtener la vacuna, en especial si se siente mareado, puede ayudar a prevenir estas lesiones.\u00bfA qu\u00e9 debo prestar atenci\u00f3n?

But if we stopped vaccinating they would return. 2 Who should get MMR vaccine and when? Children should of vaccine: First Dose: 12-15 months of age Second Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 28 days after dose of MMR if they are traveling out of the country. (This dose will not count toward their routine also get Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have either been vaccinated or had all three diseases. MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children between 1 and 12 years of age can get a \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV , which contains both MMR and (chickenpox) a separate Vaccine Information Statement for MMRV . 3 Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait. Anyone who life-threatening any other component of MMR vaccine, should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who had vaccine should not get another dose. Some people who are sick at the time the shot is scheduled may be advised to wait women should not get MMR vaccine. Pregnant women who need the birth. weeks after vaccination with MMR vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person getting the vaccine: - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids - Has any kind of cancer - Is being treated for cancer with radiation or drugs- Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)- Has gotten another vaccine within the past 4 weeks- Has recently had a transfusion or received other blood products Any of these might be a reason to not get the vaccine, or delay vaccination until later. 4 What are the risks from MMR vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, serious problems, such risk MMR serious harm, or death, is extremely rubella. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it. Mild problems Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (about 1 person out of 75) If these problems occur, it is usually within 6-14 days after the staring) caused out of 3,000 doses) Temporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) Temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe problems (very rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been reported after a MMR Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness- Permanent brain damage These are so rare that it is hard to tell whether they are caused by the vaccine. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high or severe allergic reaction fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it severe reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the Reporting System (V AERS).

Antes de que existieran las vacunas eran muy comunes, en especial entre los ni\u00f1os. Sarampi\u00f3n El virus del sarampi\u00f3n provoca erupci\u00f3n, tos, secreci\u00f3n nasal, irritaci\u00f3n de los ojos y fiebre. Puede dar lugar a infecci\u00f3n en los o\u00eddos, pulmon\u00eda, convulsiones (movimientos espasm\u00f3dicos y episodios catat\u00f3nicos), da\u00f1o cerebral y la muerte. Paperas El virus de las paperas provoca fiebre, dolor de cabeza, dolor muscular, p\u00e9rdida del apetito y ganglios inflamados. Puede dar lugar a sordera, meningitis (infecci\u00f3n del cerebro y del revestimiento de la m\u00e9dula espinal), hinchaz\u00f3n dolorosa de los test\u00edculos o de los ovarios y, muy rara vez, esterilidad. Rub\u00e9ola (sarampi\u00f3n alem\u00e1n) El virus de la rub\u00e9ola provoca erupci\u00f3n, artritis (sobre todo en mujeres) y fiebre leve. Si una mujer se contagia de rub\u00e9ola mientras est\u00e1 embarazada, podr\u00eda tener un aborto espont\u00e1neo o su beb\u00e9 podr\u00eda nacer con defectos de nacimiento graves.

MMR VIS - Spanish (4/20/2012)4\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los riesgos de la vacuna MMR? Una vacuna, como cualquier medicina, es capaz de provocar problemas graves, como reacciones al\u00e9rgicas severas. El riesgo de que la vacuna MMR ocasione un da\u00f1o grave, o la muerte, es extremadamente peque\u00f1o. Recibir la vacuna MMR es mucho m\u00e1s seguro que enfermarse de sarampi\u00f3n, paperas o rub\u00e9ola. La mayor\u00eda de las personas que reciben la vacuna MMR no tienen ning\u00fan problema grave con ella. Problemas leves Fiebre (hasta en 1 de cada 6 personas) Erupci\u00f3n leve (alrededor de 1 de cada 20 personas) Ganglios inflamados en las mejillas o en el cuello (alrededor de 1 de cada 75 personas) Si ocurre alguno de estos problemas, por lo general se presenta entre 6 y 14 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de la inyecci\u00f3n. Ocurren con menos frecuencia despu\u00e9s de la segunda dosis. Problemas moderados Convulsiones (movimientos espasm\u00f3dicos y episodios catat\u00f3nicos) provocadas por fiebre (alrededor de 1 de cada 3,000 dosis) Dolor temporal y rigidez en las articulaciones, sobre todo en mujeres adolescentes o adultas (hasta en 1 de cada 4) Niveles bajos pasajeros de plaquetas, que pueden provocar un trastorno de sangrado (alrededor de 1 de cada 30,000 dosis) Problemas severos (Muy raros) Reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica grave (menos de 1 en un mill\u00f3n de dosis) Se han reportado otros problemas severos despu\u00e9s de aplicar la vacuna MMR a ni\u00f1os, incluidos: - Sordera - Convulsiones a largo plazo, coma o disminuci\u00f3n del estado de consciencia - Da\u00f1o cerebral permanente Estos problemas son tan raros que es dif\u00edcil determinar si son provocados por la vacuna.5\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si se presenta una reacci\u00f3n grave?

These diseases can spread from person to person through the air. Varicella can be through with fluid from chickenpox blisters. Before vaccines, these diseases were very common in the United States. MMRV Vaccine 2 MMRV vaccine may be given to children from 1 through 12 years of age to protect them from these four diseases. Two doses of MMRV vaccine are recommended: - The rst dose at 12 through 15 months of age - The second dose at 4 through 6 years of age These are recommended ages. But children can get the second dose up through 12 years as long as it is at least 3 months after the rst dose. Children may also these as same protection. One less shot with MMRV . Children who got the first dose as MMR V have had more fevers and fever-related seizures (about 1 in 1,250) than children who got the first dose as separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines on the same day (about 1 in 2,500).

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine infants bacteria can from to through close problems, and meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain. Pneumococcal meningitis is fairly rare (less than 1 case per 100,000 people each year), but it leads to other health problems, including deafness and brain damage. In children, it is fatal in about 1 case out of 10. Children younger than two are at higher risk for serious disease than older children. People with certain medical conditions, people over age 65, and cigarette smokers are also at higher risk. Before vaccine, pneumococcal infections caused many problems each year in the in children younger than 5, including: more than 700 cases of meningitis, 13,000 blood infections, about 5 million ear infections, and about 200 deaths. About 4,000 adults year because vaccination more important. 2 PCV13 vaccine There are more than 90 types of pneumococcal bacteria. PCV13 protects against 13 of them. These 13 strains cause most severe infections in children and about half of infections in adults. PCV13 is routinely given to children at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age. Children in this age range are at greatest risk for serious diseases caused by pneumococcal infection. PCV13 vaccine for some older children or adults. Your doctor can give you details. A second type of pneumococcal vaccine, called PPSV23, may also be given to some children and adults, including anyone over age 65. There is a separate Vaccine Information Statement for this vaccine. 3 Precautions Anyone who has ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a dose of this vaccine, to an earlier pneumococcal vaccine called PCV7 (or Prevnar), or any component of PCV13 should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if the person being vaccinated has any severe allergies. If doctor might decide to reschedule the shot on another day. Your doctor can give you more information about any of these precautions. 4 What are the risks of PCV13 vaccine? With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. Reported problems dose age, but generally: About half of children became drowsy after the shot, had a temporary loss of appetite, had redness or tenderness where the shot was given. About 1 out of 3 had swelling where the shot was given. About 1 out of 3 had a mild fever, and about 1 in 20 had a higher fever (over 102.2\u00b0F). Up to about 8 out of 10 became fussy or irritable. Adults receiving the vaccine have reactions from any vaccine are very rare. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high or severe allergic reaction fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it severe reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the Reporting System (V AERS).

Se recomienda la vacuna neumoc\u00f3cica conjugada (llamada PCV13 o Prevnar 13) para proteger a los lactantes y ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, y a algunos ni\u00f1os m\u00e1s grandes y adultos con determinadas afecciones de salud contra la enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica. La enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica se produce por una infecci\u00f3n con las bacterias Streptococcus pneumoniae . Estas bacterias pueden diseminarse de persona a persona a trav\u00e9s del contacto cercano. La enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica puede provocar problemas de salud severos, lo que incluye neumon\u00eda, infecciones de la sangre y meningitis. La meningitis es una infecci\u00f3n del recubrimiento del cerebro. La meningitis neumoc\u00f3cica es bastante poco frecuente (menos de 1 caso cada 100,000 personas cada a\u00f1o), pero produce otros problemas de salud, que incluyen sordera y da\u00f1o cerebral. En ni\u00f1os, es mortal en aproximadamente 1 de 10 casos. Los ni\u00f1os menores de dos a\u00f1os tienen un riesgo m\u00e1s alto de presentar enfermedades graves que los ni\u00f1os m\u00e1s grandes. Las personas con determinadas afecciones m\u00e9dicas, las que son mayores de 65 a\u00f1os y los fumadores de cigarrillos tambi\u00e9n tienen un riesgo m\u00e1s alto. Antes de la vacuna, las infecciones neumoc\u00f3cicas produc\u00edan muchos problemas cada a\u00f1o en los Estados Unidos en ni\u00f1os menores de 5 a\u00f1os, incluidos: M\u00e1s de 700 casos de meningitis. 13,000 infecciones de la sangre. Aproximadamente 5 millones de infecciones en el o\u00eddo. Aproximadamente 200 muertes. Cerca de 4,000 adultos a\u00fan mueren todos los a\u00f1os a causa de infecciones neumoc\u00f3cicas.

La PCV13 lo protege contra 13 de estos tipos. Estas 13 cepas producen la mayor\u00eda de las infecciones severas en los ni\u00f1os y aproximadamente la mitad de las infecciones en los adultos. La PCV13 se administra en forma rutinaria a ni\u00f1os de 2, 4 y 6 meses, y de 12 a 15 meses. Los ni\u00f1os en este rango etario son los que tienen el riesgo m\u00e1s grande de presentar enfermedades graves provocadas por una infecci\u00f3n neumoc\u00f3cica.

Aproximadamente, 1 de cada 3 ni\u00f1os present\u00f3 hinchaz\u00f3n en la zona donde se administr\u00f3 la inyecci\u00f3n. Aproximadamente, 1 de cada 3 ni\u00f1os tuvo fiebre moderada y , aproximadamente, 1 de cada 20 ni\u00f1os tuvo fiebre m\u00e1s alta (superior a los 102.2 \u00b0F). Hasta 8 de cada 10 ni\u00f1os, aproximadamente, se volvieron quisquillosos o irritables. Los adultos que recibieron la vacuna han reportado enrojecimiento, dolor e hinchaz\u00f3n en la zona donde se administr\u00f3 la inyecci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n se han reportado fiebre moderada, fatiga, dolor de cabeza, escalofr\u00edos o dolor muscular. Reacciones al\u00e9rgicas potencialmente mortales a causa de cualquier vacuna son muy poco frecuentes. indicios podr\u00edan comenzar entre algunos minutos y algunas horas despu\u00e9s de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la vacuna. \u00bfQu\u00e9 debo hacer? Si cree que es una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa u otra emergencia que no puede esperar, lleve a la persona al hospital m\u00e1s cercano o llame al 911. De lo contrario, llame a su m\u00e9dico. Luego, debe reportarse la reacci\u00f3n al \"Sistema de Notificaci\u00f3n de Reacciones Adversas a las Vacunas\" (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS).

It enters the body through the mouth. Usually it does not cause serious illness. But sometimes it causes paralysis (can't move arm or leg), and it can cause meningitis (irritation of the lining of the brain). It can kill people who get it, usually by paralyzing the muscles that help them breathe. Polio used to be very common in the United States. It paralyzed and killed thousands of people a year before we had a vaccine. 2 Why get vaccinated? Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) can prevent polio. History: A 1916 polio epidemic in the United States killed 6,000 people and paralyzed 27,000 more. In the early 1950's there were more than 25,000 cases of polio reported each year. Polio vaccination was begun in 1955. By 1960 the number of reported cases had dropped to about 3,000, and by 1979 there were only about 10. The success of polio vaccination in the U.S. and other countries has sparked a world-wide effort to eliminate polio. Today: Polio has been eliminated from the United States. But the disease is still common in some parts of the world. It would only take one person infected with polio virus coming from another country to bring the disease back here if we were not protected by vaccine. If the effort to eliminate the disease from the world is successful, some day we won't need polio vaccine. Until then, we need to keep getting our children vaccinated. Who should get polio vaccine3 and when? IPV is a shot, given in the leg or arm, depending on age. It may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children Children get 4 doses of IPV , at these ages: A dose at 2 at getting these vaccines may get one more (5th) dose of polio vaccine. This is not a problem. Adults Most adults 18 and older do not need polio vaccine because they were vaccinated as children. But some adults are at higher risk and should consider polio vaccination: (1) people traveling to areas of the world where polio is common, (2) laboratory workers who might handle polio virus, and (3) health care workers treating patients who could have polio. Adults in these three groups: who have never been vaccinated against polio should get 3 doses of IPV: -Two doses separated by 1 to 2 months, and -A third dose 6 to 12 months after the second. who have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine in the past should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses. 4 It doesn't matter how long it has been since the earlier dose(s). who have had 3 or more doses of polio vaccine in the past may get a booster dose of IPV . Your doctor can give you more information. Some people should not get IPV or should wait. These people should not get IPV: B, should not get polio vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who had previous polio shot one. These people should wait: Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting polio vaccine. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. Ask your doctor for more information. 5 What are the risks from IPV? Some people who get IPV get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people don't have any problems at all with it. However, any medicine could cause a serious side effect, such as a severe allergic reaction or even death. The risk of polio vaccine causing serious harm is extremely small. What if there is a moderate or severe problem? What should I look for? condition, such a serious allergic reaction, reaction occurred, it would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. Signs of a serious allergic breathing, or swelling of the throat. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS) form. Or you can le this report through the V AERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does provide medical advice.

La polio es una enfermedad causada por un virus. Entra en el cuerpo a trav\u00e9s de la boca. Por lo general no causa una enfermedad grave, pero a veces causa par\u00e1lisis (no poder mover un brazo o una pierna) y puede causar meningitis (irritaci\u00f3n del recubrimiento del cerebro). Puede matar a las personas que se contagian, por lo general al paralizar los m\u00fasculos que las ayudan a respirar. La polio sol\u00eda ser muy com\u00fan en los Estados Unidos. Paraliz\u00f3 y mat\u00f3 a miles de personas un a\u00f1o antes de que tuvi\u00e9ramos una vacuna. 2\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es necesario vacunarse? La vacuna inactivada contra la polio (Inactivat-ed Polio Vaccine, IPV) puede prevenir la polio. Historia: en 1916 una epidemia de polio en los Estados Unidos mat\u00f3 a 6,000 personas y paraliz\u00f3 a 27,000 m\u00e1s. A principios de la d\u00e9cada de 1950 se reportaban m\u00e1s de 25,000 casos de polio cada a\u00f1o. La vacuna contra la polio co-menz\u00f3 en 1955. Para 1960 el n\u00famero de casos reportados hab\u00eda bajado a alrededor de 3,000 y para 1979 solo hab\u00eda alrededor de 10. El \u00e9xito de la vacuna contra la polio en los EE. UU. y en otros pa\u00edses ha desencadenado un esfuerzo a nivel mundial para eliminar la polio. En la actualidad: la polio ha sido eliminada de los Estados Unidos, no obstante la enferme-dad sigue siendo com\u00fan en algunas partes del mundo. Solo se necesitar\u00eda que una persona infectada con el virus de la polio llegara de otro pa\u00eds para que trajera la enfermedad de regreso si no estuvi\u00e9ramos protegidos por la vacuna. Si el esfuerzo para eliminar la enfermedad del mundo tiene \u00e9xito, alg\u00fan d\u00eda no necesitaremos la vacuna contra la polio. Hasta que eso suceda, necesitamos seguir vacunado a nuestros hijos. 3\u00bfQui\u00e9n debe vacunarse contra la polio y cu\u00e1ndo? La IPV es una inyecci\u00f3n que se aplica en la pier- na o en el brazo dependiendo de la edad. Puede aplicarse al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas. Ni\u00f1os Los ni\u00f1os reciben 4 dosis de la IPV, a las siguientes edades: Una dosis a los 2 meses Una dosis a los 4 meses Una dosis a los 6-18 meses Una dosis de refuerzo a los 4-6 a\u00f1os Algunas vacunas \"combinadas\" (varias vacunas diferentes en la misma inyecci\u00f3n) contienen la IPV. Los ni\u00f1os que reciben estas vacunas pueden recibir una dosis m\u00e1s (5 a) de la vacuna contra la polio. Esto no representa un problema. Adultos La mayor\u00eda de los adultos de 18 a\u00f1os y mayores no necesitan la vacuna contra la polio porque fueron vacunados cuando eran ni\u00f1os. Pero algunos adultos est\u00e1n en mayor riesgo y deben considerar aplicarse la vacuna contra la polio: (1) personas que viajan a \u00e1reas del mundo en donde la polio es com\u00fan, (2) trabajadores de laboratorios que podr\u00edan manipular el virus de la polio, y (3) trabajadores de la salud que atienden a paci - entes que podr\u00edan tener polio. Los adultos en estos tres grupos: que nunca han sido vacunados contra la polio deben aplicarse 3 dosis de la IPV: - Dos dosis con un periodo de separaci\u00f3n de entre 1 y 2 meses y - Una tercera dosis entre 6 y 12 meses despu\u00e9s de la segunda. que se hayan aplicado 1 o 2 dosis de la vacuna contra la polio en el pasado deben aplicarse 1 o 2 dosis restantes. No importa cu\u00e1nto tiempo haya pasado desde la(s) primera(s) dosis.Muchas de las declaraciones informativas sobre vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y otros idiomas.

Polio VIS - Spanish (11/8/11)Las siguientes personas no deben aplicarse la IPV: Personas que presenten una alergia, que pueda poner en peligro la vida, a alguno de los com- ponentes de la IPV, incluyendo los antibi\u00f3ti-cos neomicina, estreptomicina o polimixina B, no deber\u00e1n aplicarse la vacuna contra la polio. Informe a su m\u00e9dico si ha tenido alguna alergia severa. Personas que hayan tenido una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9r- gica a una inyecci\u00f3n contra la polio no deben aplicarse otra. Estas personas deben esperar: Personas con una enfermedad moderada o se- vera en el momento en que est\u00e9 programada la vacunaci\u00f3n por lo general deben esperar hasta recuperarse antes de aplicarse la vacuna con-tra la polio. Las personas con enfermedades menores, como gripe, pueden vacunarse. Consulte a su m\u00e9dico para obtener m\u00e1s infor-maci\u00f3n. A algunas personas que se aplican la IPV les aparece un \u00e1rea sensible en donde se aplic\u00f3 la inyecci\u00f3n. No se conocen problemas graves causados por la IPV, y la mayor\u00eda de las perso-nas no tienen problemas con ella. Sin embargo, cualquier medicina puede causar un efecto secundario grave, como una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa o incluso la muerte. El riesgo de que la vacuna contra la polio cause lesiones graves es extremadamente peque\u00f1o. 6\u00bfQu\u00e9 hago si se presenta un problema moderado o severo? \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 debo estar pendiente? Busque todo signo inusual, como una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa, fiebre alta o cambios inusu- ales en la conducta. Si ocurriera una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa, esta deber\u00eda presentarse en cuesti\u00f3n de minutos y hasta unas cuantas horas despu\u00e9s de la inyec-ci\u00f3n. Los signos de una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica grave pueden incluir dificultad para respirar, debili-dad, ronquera o jadeos, pulso acelerado, urticar-ia, mareos, palidez o hinchaz\u00f3n de la garganta. \u00bfQu\u00e9 debo hacer? Llame a un m\u00e9dico o lleve a la persona al m\u00e9dico de inmediato. D\u00edgale al m\u00e9dico lo que ocurri\u00f3, la fecha y la hora en la que ocurri\u00f3, y cu\u00e1ndo le pusieron la vacuna. P\u00eddale a su m\u00e9dico que reporte la reacci\u00f3n presentando un formulario del Sistema de reporte de eventos adversos derivados de las vacunas (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS).

Rotavirus is a virus that causes diarrhea, mostly in babies and young children. The be severe, and lead to dehydration. V omiting and fever are babies with rotavirus. Before rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus disease was a common and serious health problem for children in the United States. Almost all children in the U.S. had at least one rotavirus infection before their 5 th birthday. Every year: more than 400,000 young children had to see a doctor for illness caused by rotavirus, more than 200,000 had to go to the emergency room, 55,000 to 70,000 had to be hospitalized, and 20 to 60 died. Rotavirus vaccine has been used since 2006 in the United States. Because children are protected by the vaccine, hospitalizations, and emergency visits for rotavirus brands of rotavirus vaccine are available. Your baby will get either 2 or 3 doses, depending on which vaccine is used. Doses of rotavirus vaccine are recommended at these ages: - First Dose: 2 months of age - Second Dose: 4 months of age - Third Dose: 6 months of age (if needed) Rotavirus vaccine is a liquid that is swallowed, not a shot. Rotavirus vaccine may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines. Rotavirus vaccine is very good at by rotavirus. Almost all will be protected from severe rotavirus diarrhea. And most of these babies will not get rotavirus diarrhea at all. The vaccine will not prevent diarrhea vomiting caused by other germs.Another virus called porcine circovirus (or parts of it) can be found in both rotavirus vaccines. This is not a virus that infects people, and there is no known safety risk. For more information, see www.fda.gov/ BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ ucm205547.htm. 3 Some babies should not get this vaccine A baby who has had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of rotavirus vaccine should not get another dose. A baby who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of rotavirus vaccine should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if your baby has any severe allergies that you know of, including get a type of bowel blockage called \"intussusception\" should not get rotavirus vaccine. Babies who are mildly ill can probably get the vaccine today. Babies who are moderately or severely ill should severe Check system weakened because of: other disease drugs 4 Risks of a vaccine reaction With a vaccine, like any medicine, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious side effects are also possible, but are very rare.Most babies who get rotavirus vaccine do not have any problems with it. But some problems have problems is a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital, and could require surgery. It happens \"naturally\" in some babies every year in the United States, and usually there is no known reason for it. There is also a small risk of intussusception from rotavirus vaccination, usually within a week after the 1 st or 2nd vaccine dose. This additional risk is estimated to range from about 1 in 20,000 U.S. infants to 1 in 100,000 U.S. infants who get rotavirus vaccine. Your doctor can give you more information. 5 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? For intussusception , signs of stomach pain along with severe crying. Early on, these episodes could last just a few minutes and come and go several times in an hour. Babies might pull might also vomit several times or have blood in the stool, or could appear weak or very irritable. These signs would usually happen during the first week after the 1st or 2nd dose of rotavirus vaccine, but look for them any time after vaccination. Look for anything else that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high or severe allergic reaction fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.What should I do? If you think it is intussusception , call a doctor right away. If you can't reach your doctor, take your baby to a hospital. Tell them when your baby got the vaccine. If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get your baby to the nearest hospital. Afterward, Y our doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 6 The National V accine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines.

Visite www.immunize.org/visVacuna contra el rotavirus Lo que usted necesita saber 1 \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es necesario vacunarse? El rotavirus es un virus que causa diarrea, principalmente en beb\u00e9s y ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os. La diarrea puede ser severa, y provoca deshidrataci\u00f3n. Los v\u00f3mitos y la fiebre tambi\u00e9n son comunes en beb\u00e9s con rotavirus. Antes de que existiera la vacuna, la enfermedad del rotavirus era un problema de salud grave y com\u00fan para los ni\u00f1os en los Estados Unidos. La mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os en los Estados Unidos tuvo, al menos, una infecci\u00f3n por rotavirus antes de cumplir los 5 a\u00f1os. Cada a\u00f1o: m\u00e1s de 400,000 ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os acudieron a un m\u00e9dico por enfermedades provocadas por el rotavirus, m\u00e1s de 200,000 acudieron a salas de emergencias, entre 55,000 y 70,000 fueron hospitalizados, y entre 20 y 60 murieron. La vacuna contra el rotavirus es utilizada en los Estados Unidos desde el a\u00f1o 2006. Debido a que los ni\u00f1os est\u00e1n protegidos por la vacuna, las hospitalizaciones y las visitas de emergencia por rotavirus han disminuido considerablemente. 2 Vacuna contra el rotavirus Hay dos marcas de vacunas contra el rotavirus disponibles. Su beb\u00e9 recibir\u00e1 2 o 3 dosis, seg\u00fan la vacuna que se utilice. Se recomiendan las dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus en estas edades: - Primera dosis: 2 meses de edad - Segunda dosis: 4 meses de edad - Tercera dosis: 6 meses de edad (si es necesario) La vacuna contra el rotavirus es un l\u00edquido que se toma por v\u00eda oral, no una inyecci\u00f3n. La vacuna contra el rotavirus puede administrarse en forma segura al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas. La vacuna contra el rotavirus es muy eficaz para evitar la diarrea y los v\u00f3mitos que provoca este virus. Casi todos los beb\u00e9s que reciben esta vacuna estar\u00e1n protegidos contra la diarrea severa provocada por el rotavirus. Y la mayor\u00eda de estos beb\u00e9s no tendr\u00e1n diarrea por rotavirus. La vacuna no evitar\u00e1 la diarrea o los v\u00f3mitos provocados por otros g\u00e9rmenes.Otro virus llamado circovirus porcino (o algunas partes de este) se pueden encontrar en ambas vacunas contra el rotavirus. Este no es un virus que infecta a las personas, y no se conocen riesgos de seguridad. Para obtener m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n, consulte www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm205547.htm. 3 Algunos beb\u00e9s no deben recibir esta vacuna Un beb\u00e9 que haya tenido una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa (que haya puesto en riesgo su vida) a una dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus no deber\u00eda recibir otra dosis. Un beb\u00e9 que tenga una alergia severa (que ponga en riesgo su vida) a alg\u00fan componente de la vacuna contra el rotavirus no deber\u00eda recibir la vacuna. Informe a su m\u00e9dico en caso de que sepa que su beb\u00e9 tiene alguna alergia severa, incluida una alergia severa al l\u00e1tex. Los beb\u00e9s con \"inmunodeficiencia combinada severa\" (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, SCID) no deben recibir la vacuna contra el rotavirus. Los beb\u00e9s que hayan tenido un tipo de obstrucci\u00f3n intestinal llamada \"invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal\" no deben recibir la vacuna contra el rotavirus. Los beb\u00e9s que se encuentran ligeramente enfermos posiblemente puedan recibir la vacuna hoy. Los beb\u00e9s que tienen una enfermedad moderada o severa posiblemente deban esperar hasta su recuperaci\u00f3n. Esto incluye a beb\u00e9s con diarrea o v\u00f3mitos moderados o severos. Consulte a su m\u00e9dico si el sistema inmunitario de su beb\u00e9 est\u00e1 debilitado a causa de: - VIH/SIDA u otra enfermedad que afecta el sistema inmunitario; - un tratamiento con drogas, como esteroides a largo plazo; o - c\u00e1ncer, o tratamiento contra el c\u00e1ncer con radiograf\u00edas o drogas. Rotavirus Vaccine - Spanish (8/26/13) 4 Riesgos de una reacci\u00f3n a la vacuna Con una vacuna, como con cualquier medicamento, hay probabilidades de que se produzcan efectos secundarios. Generalmente son leves y desaparecen por s\u00ed solos. Tambi\u00e9n es posible que se produzcan efectos secundarios graves, pero son muy poco frecuentes. La mayor\u00eda de los beb\u00e9s que reciben la vacuna contra el rotavirus no tienen ning\u00fan tipo de problema con ella. Sin embargo, algunos problemas se han asociado con la vacuna contra el rotavirus: Problemas leves Los beb\u00e9s pueden presentar irritabilidad, o tener diarrea o v\u00f3mitos leves y temporales luego de recibir una dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus. Problemas graves La invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal es un tipo de obstrucci\u00f3n intestinal que se trata en un hospital, y puede necesitar cirug\u00eda. Sucede \"naturalmente\" en algunos beb\u00e9s cada a\u00f1o en los Estados Unidos, y en general no se conoce la raz\u00f3n por la cual se produce. Existe tambi\u00e9n un riesgo peque\u00f1o de invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal por la vacuna contra el rotavirus, generalmente la semana siguiente a la 1. a o 2.a dosis de la vacuna. Se estima que este riesgo adicional oscila entre 1 en 20,000 beb\u00e9s y 1 en 100,000 beb\u00e9s estadounidenses que reciben la vacuna contra el rotavirus. Su m\u00e9dico puede proporcionarle m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n. 5 \u00bfQu\u00e9 hago si ocurre una reacci\u00f3n grave? \u00bfA qu\u00e9 debo prestar atenci\u00f3n? Para la invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal, preste atenci\u00f3n a dolores en el est\u00f3mago junto con llanto severo. Al principio, estos episodios pueden durar apenas unos pocos minutos y aparecer y desaparecer varias veces en una hora. Los bebes pueden flexionar las piernas hacia el pecho. Es posible que su beb\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n vomite varias veces, que se muestre muy irritable o d\u00e9bil, o aparezca sangre en las heces. Estos signos generalmente podr\u00edan aparecer durante la primera semana luego de la 1. a o 2.a dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus.

It can lead to tightening of muscles in the head and neck so you can't open your mouth, swallow, or sometimes even breathe. Tetanus kills about 1 out of 5 people who are infected. DIPHTHERIA can cause a thick coating to form in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing weight loss, incontinence, and rib fractures. Up to 2 in 100 adolescents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, which could include pneumonia or death. These diseases are by pertussis scratches, or wounds. Before vaccines, the United States saw as many as 200,000 cases a year of diphtheria and pertussis, and hundreds of cases began, and diphtheria have about Tdap Tdap is routinely given at age 11 or 12. People who did not get Tdap at that age should get it as soon as possible. Tdap for health care a baby the risk for severe, complications pertussis. A similar vaccine, given every 10 years. Tdap may be given as one of these boosters if you have not already gotten a dose. Tdap may also be cut or burn to prevent tetanus infection. Your doctor can give you more information.Tdap may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get this vaccine If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction tetanus, diphtheria, containing vaccine, OR if you have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you should not get Tdap. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. If you had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a childhood dose of DTP or DTaP, you should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found. You can still get Td.

El T\u00c9TANOS (trismo) causa espasmos musculares dolorosos y rigidez, por lo general en todo el cuerpo. Puede resultar en tensi\u00f3n de los m\u00fasculos de la cabeza y del cuello por lo que la v\u00edctima no puede abrir la boca ni tragar, y a veces incluso no puede respirar. El t\u00e9tanos mata aproxi - madamente a 1 de cada 5 personas infectadas. La DIFTERIA puede ocasionar que una membrana gruesa cubra la parte posterior de la garganta, lo cual puede resultar en problemas para respirar, par\u00e1lisis, insuficiencia card\u00edaca e incluso la muerte. La TOS FERINA (tos convulsiva) causa accesos de tos seve- ros que pueden resultar en dificultad para respirar, v\u00f3mitos y alteraciones del sue\u00f1o. Puede dar lugar a p\u00e9rdida de peso, incontinencia, fractura d e costillas y desmayos por la tos violenta. Hasta 2 de cada 100 adolescentes y 5 de cada 100 adultos con tos ferina son hospitalizados o tienen complicaciones, incluyendo pulmon\u00eda y la muerte. Estas tres enfermedades son causadas por bacterias. La difteria y la tos ferina se contagian de persona a persona. El t\u00e9tanos entra en el cuerpo a trav\u00e9s de cortadas, raspones o heridas. En los Estados Unidos se presentaban hasta 200,000 casos al a \u00f1o de difteria y tos ferina antes de que las vacunas estuvieran disponibles, y centenares de casos de t\u00e9tanos. Desde entonces, l os casos de t\u00e9tanos y difteria se han reducido aproximadamen- te hasta un 99% y los casos de tos ferina hasta un 92%.Los ni\u00f1os de 6 a\u00f1os y menores reciben la vacuna DTaP para protegerlos contra estas tres enfermedades. Pero los ni\u00f1os m\u00e1s grandes, adolescentes y adultos tambi\u00e9n necesitan protecci\u00f3n.Muchas de las declaraciones informativas sobre vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y otros idiomas.

Existen dos vacunas disponibles para proteger a las personas de 7 a\u00f1os de edad y mayores de estas enfermedades: La vacuna Td se ha usado desde hace muchos a\u00f1os. Protege contra el t\u00e9tanos y la difteria. La vacuna Tdap fue autorizada en 2005. Es la primera vacuna para adolescentes y adultos que protege contra la tos ferina, el t\u00e9tanos y la difteria. Se recomienda una dosis de refuerzo de la vacuna Td cada 10 a\u00f1os. La Tdap se aplica solo una vez. Los adultos (incluidas las mujeres que tengan la posibilidad de quedar embarazadas y los adultos de 65 a\u00f1os y mayores) que esperan estar en contacto cercano con un beb\u00e9 de menos de 12 meses de edad deber\u00e1n recibir una dosis de Tdap con el fin de proteger al beb\u00e9 de la tos ferina. Los profesionales de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica que tengan contacto d irecto c on p acientes en hospitales o cl\u00ednicas deben recibir una dosis de Tdap. Protecci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de una herida Es posible que una persona que sufra una cortada o quema- dura severa necesite una dosis de Td o Tdap para evitar una infecci\u00f3n por t\u00e9tanos. Se debe aplicar la vacuna Tdap en cualquier persona que nunca antes haya recibido una dosis. Se debe aplicar la vacuna Td si la vacuna Tdap no est\u00e1 dis- ponible o en: - cualquier persona que ya haya recibido una dosis de Tdap, - ni\u00f1os de 7 a 9 a\u00f1os de edad que hayan completado la serie de DTaP infantil, o - adultos de 65 a\u00f1os y mayores. Mujeres embarazadas Las mujeres embarazadas que nunca se hayan aplicado una dosis de Tdap deben aplicarse una, despu\u00e9s de las 20 sema- nas de gestaci\u00f3n y de preferencia durante el tercer trimestre. Si no se aplican la vacuna Tdap durante el embarazo, debe- r\u00e1n aplicarse una dosis tan pronto como sea posible despu\u00e9s del parto. Las mujeres embarazadas que ya antes se hayan aplicado la vacuna Tdap y necesiten una vacuna contra el t\u00e9tanos o contra la difteria mientras est\u00e1n embarazadas deben aplicarse la vacuna Td. La vacuna Tdap o Td pueden aplicarse al mismo tiempo que otras vacunas.1\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es necesario vacunarse? 2Vacunas para adolescentes y adultos: Td y Tdap 3\u00bfCu\u00e1l vacuna y cu\u00e1ndo? Entre los 7 y los 18 a\u00f1os de edad Se recomienda una dosis de Tdap a los 11 o 12 a\u00f1os. Esta dosis podr\u00eda ser administrada a ni\u00f1os desde 7 a\u00f1os que se saltaron una o m\u00e1s dosis infantiles de DTaP. Los ni\u00f1os y adolescentes que no recibieron la serie completa de inyecciones de DTaP cuando ten\u00edan 7 a\u00f1os deben comple- tar la serie con una combinaci\u00f3n de Td y Tdap. Personas de 19 a\u00f1os y mayores Todos los adultos deben aplicarse una dosis de refuerzo de Td cada 10 a\u00f1os. Los adultos menores de 65 a\u00f1os que nunca hayan recibido la Tdap deben aplicarse una dosis de Tdap como su pr\u00f3xima dosis de refuerzo. Los adultos de 65 a\u00f1os y mayores pueden aplicarse una dosis de refuerzo de Tdap.4Algunas personas no deben vacunarse o deben esperar Cualquier persona que haya presentado una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgi- ca despu\u00e9s de la aplicaci\u00f3n de una dosis de cualquier vacuna contra el t\u00e9tanos, la difteria o la tos ferina no debe aplicarse la Td ni la Tdap. Cualquier persona que tenga alergia severa a cualquiera de los componentes de una vacuna no deber\u00e1 aplicarse esa va- cuna. I nforme a s u m \u00e9dico si la persona a la que se le aplicar\u00e1 la vacuna tiene alguna alergia severa. Cualquier persona que haya estado en coma, o que haya tenido convulsiones largas o m\u00faltiples dentro de los deber\u00e1 aplicarse la vacuna Tdap, a menos que se haya encontrado una causa diferente a la vacuna. Estas personas pueden apli - carse la vacuna Td. Informe a su m\u00e9dico si la persona que se aplicar\u00e1 alguna de las vacunas: - tiene epilepsia u otro problema del sistema nervioso, - tuvo hinchaz\u00f3n severa o dolor severo despu\u00e9s de una dosis previa de de las vacunas DTP, DTaP, DT, Td o Vacuna Td o Tdap Lo que usted necesita saberCualquier persona que tenga una enfermedad moderada o se- vera el d\u00eda en que est\u00e9 programada la aplicaci\u00f3n de la vacuna por lo general debe esperar hasta recuperarse antes de ponerse la vacuna Tdap o Td. Por lo general, una persona co n una enfermedad leve o con poca fiebre puede vacunarse. Con una vacuna, como con cualquier medicina, siempre hay un peque\u00f1o riesgo de reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica que pueda poner en peligro la vida u ocasionar otro problema grave. Despu\u00e9s de cualquier procedimiento m\u00e9dico, incluida la vacu- naci\u00f3n, pueden presentarse desmayos y s\u00edntomas relacionados (como movimientos espasm\u00f3dicos repentinos). Sentarse o acostarse durante unos 15 minutos despu\u00e9s de una vacunaci\u00f3n puede ayudar a evitar desmayos y lesiones causadas por ca\u00eddas. Informe a su m\u00e9dico si el paciente se siente mareado o aturdi-do, o si tiene cambios en la visi\u00f3n o zumbido en los o\u00eddos. Es mucho m\u00e1s probable que al contraer la enfermedad de t\u00e9ta- nos, difteria o tos ferina se produzcan problemas mucho m\u00e1s severos que al ponerse las vacunas Td o Tdap.

It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. It causes a rash, itching, fever, lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and faster. 2Who should get chickenpox vaccine who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at 1st Dose: 12-15 months of age 2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. Catch-Up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person's age. Ask your provider. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV, which and MMR vac\u00ad cines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait 3 People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is should wait women should until after they have given birth. Women get pregnant for getting chickenpox vaccine. Some people should check with the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks longer -Has any kind of cancer -Is getting cancer treatment or a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine.

Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose than after the second. Mild Problems Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this Moderate Problems Seizure Other serious problems, including severe brain reac\u00adtions and low blood count, after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and fever than has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also MMR V . 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or I look a high fever, beat or dizziness. What should I do?

Puede conducir a infecciones serias de la piel, cicatrices, neumon\u00eda, da\u00f1o cerebral o la muerte. El virus de la varicela se puede transmitir de una persona a otra por el aire o por contacto con el l\u00edquido de las ampollas de la varicela. A\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, a una persona que tuvo varicela le puede dar un sarpullido doloroso llamado culebrilla. Antes de la vacuna, en Estados Unidos cada a\u00f1o unas 11,000 personas eran hospitalizadas por varicela. Antes de la vacuna, en Estados Unidos cada a\u00f1o unas 10 personas mor\u00edan debido a la varicela. La vacuna contra la varicela puede prevenir la varicela. A la mayor\u00eda de las personas vacunadas contra la varicela no les da varicela. Pero si alguien vacunado se enferma de varicela, por lo general es muy leve. Tendr\u00e1 menos ampollas, ser\u00e1 menos propenso a tener fiebre y se recuperar\u00e1 m\u00e1s pronto.Nota: Una vacuna \"combinada\" llamada MMRV, la cual contiene tanto la vacuna contra la varicela como la vacuna contra el sarampi\u00f3n, las paperas y la rub\u00e9ola (MMR), puede ser administrada en lugar de dos vacunas individuales para las personas de 12 a\u00f1os de edad o menos.

La mayor\u00eda de las personas que se vacunan contra la varicela no tienen ning\u00fan problema con la vacuna. Sin embargo, las vacunas, como cualquier medicamento, pueden causar problemas serios, como reacciones alergicas graves. El riesgo de que la vacuna contra la varicela cause un da\u00f1o serio, o la muerte, es sumamente peque\u00f1o. Problemas leves Dolor o hinchaz\u00f3n en el lugar donde se aplico la inyecci\u00f3n (cerca de 1 de cada 5 ni\u00f1os y hasta 1 de cada 3 adolescentes y adultos) Fiebre (1 persona de cada 10, 6 menos) Un sarpullido leve hasta un mes despues de la vacuna (1 persona de cada 20, 6 menos). Es posible que estas personas infecten a otras personas que viven con ellas, pero esto ocurre muy rara vez. Problemas moderados Convulsiones (ataques de sacudidas del cuerpo y fijaci\u00f3n de la mirada) causadas por fiebre (menos de 1 persona de cada 1,000). Problemas graves Neumon\u00eda (ocurre muy rara vez) Despu\u00e9s de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la vacuna contra la varicela se han informado otros problemas serios, incluyendo reacciones cerebrales graves y bajo recuento sangu\u00edneo. Estos problemas ocurren tan rara vez que los expertos no pueden decir si fueron causados o no por la vacuna. Si son causados por ella, es algo que ocurre muy rara vez. \u00bfA qu\u00e9 debo prestar atenci\u00f3n? Preste atenci\u00f3n a cualquier cosa fuera de lo com\u00fan, como fiebre alta o cambios en el comportamiento.

Visite www.immunize.org/vis Your baby will get these vaccines Ask your doctor about \"combination vaccines, \" which can reduce the number of shots baby needs. Combination vaccines given separately. pneumococcal disease About this vaccine information statement Please read this Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) before your baby gets his or her immunizations, and take it home with you afterward. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. This VIS tells you about the benefits and about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and how to get more information about vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases. (Individual VISs work children get their immune system usually produces protective \"antibodies, \" which keep them from getting the same disease again. But getting sick is no fun, and it can be dangerous or even fatal. Immunity from vaccines: Vaccines are made with the same bacteria or viruses that cause disease, but they have been weakened or killed\u2014or only parts of them are safe. child's system produces antibodies, as after exposure to the actual disease. This means the child will develop immunity in the same way, but without having to sick first.Vaccine benefits: why get vaccinated? Diseases have injured and killed many children over the years in the United States. Polio paralyzed about 37,000 and killed about 1,700 every year in the 1950s. Hib disease was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children under 5 years of age. About 15,000 people died each year from diphtheria before there was a vaccine. Up to 70,000 children a year were hospitalized because of rotavirus disease. Hepatitis B can cause liver damage and cancer in 1 child out of 4 who are infected, and tetanus kills 1 out of every 5 who get it. Thanks mostly to vaccines, these diseases are not nearly as common as they used to be. But they have not disappeared, either. Some are common in other countries, and if we stop vaccinating they will come back here. This has already happened in some parts of the world. When vaccination rates go down, disease go symptoms include a thick covering in the back of the throat that can make it hard to breathe. Diphtheria can lead to breathing problems, and include painful tightening of all over body. Tetanus can lead to stiffness of the jaw violent coughing spells that can make it hard for a baby to eat, drink, or breathe. These spells can last for weeks. Pertussis can lead to pneumonia, seizures, and brain damage. 4. Signs and symptoms can include trouble breathing. There may not be any signs or symptoms in mild cases. Hib can lead to meningitis the brain and spinal cord coverings); pneumonia; infections of the blood, joints, of the heart; brain damage; and deafness. 5. HEPATITIS can include tiredness, diarrhea and vomiting, pain in muscles, joints and stomach. But usually there are no signs or symptoms at all. Hepatitis B can lead to liver damage, and liver cancer. 6. POLIO Signs and symptoms can include flu-like illness, or there may be no signs or symptoms at all. Polio can lead to paralysis (can't move an arm or cord coverings), blood infections, ear infections, pneumonia, hospitalization. Any these diseases can lead to death. How do babies catch these diseases? Usually from contact with other children or adults who are already infected, sometimes without even knowing they are infected. A mother with Hepatitis B infection can also infect her baby at birth. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound; it is not spread from person to person.Routine baby children should not get pertussis vaccine. These children can get a vaccine called DT. Hepatitis B 3 Birth, 1-2 months, 6-18 monthsChildren may get an additional dose at 4 months with some \"combination\" vaccines. Polio months), 12-15 months There are 2 types of Hib vaccine. With one type the 6-month dose is vaccine. Rotavirus 2 3 2 months, 4 months, (6 months)Not a shot, but drops that are swallowed. There are 2 types of rotavirus vaccine. With one type the 6-month dose is not needed. Annual flu vaccination is also for children 6 of age and older. Precautions Most babies can safely get all of But some babies should not get certain vaccines. Y our doctor will help you decide. A child who has ever had a serious reaction, such as a life-threatening allergic after a vaccine dose should not get another dose of that vaccine. Tell your doctor if your child has any severe allergies, or has had a severe reaction after . (Serious reactions to vaccines and severe allergies are rare.) A child who is sick on the day vaccinations are scheduled might be asked to come back for them. Talk to your doctor... before getting DTaP vaccine, if your child ever had any of these reactions after a dose of DTaP: - A brain or nervous system disease within 7 days,- Non-stop crying for 3 hours or more,- A seizure or collapse,- A fever of over 105\u00b0F. before getting Polio vaccine , if your child has life-threatening allergy to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B. before getting Hepatitis B vaccine, if your child has a life-threatening allergy to yeast. before getting intussusception (bowel hospital). before getting PCV13 or DTaP vaccine, if your child ever Vaccines can cause Most vaccine reactions are mild: tenderness, redness, or swelling where given; or a mild fever. These happen to about 1 child in 4. They appear soon after the shot is given and go away within a day or two. Other reactions: Individual childhood vaccines have been associated with other mild or serious problems: DTaP Fussiness 1 child in 3); tiredness or poor appetite (up to 1 child in 10); vomiting (up to 1 child in 50); swelling of the entire arm or leg for 1-7 days (up to 1 child in 30)\u2014usually after the 4th or 5th child in 14,000); non-stop crying for 3 hours or longer (up to 1 child in 1,000); fever over 105\u00b0F (1 child in 16,000). term seizures, lowered reported. These problems happen so rarely that it is hard to tell whether they were actually caused by the vaccination or just happened afterward by chance.Polio vaccine / Hepatitis B vaccine / Hib vaccine These vaccines have not been associated with other mild problems, or During the vaccine, became drowsy or lost their appetite. Rotavirus vaccine Mild problems: Children who get rotavirus vaccine are slightly more likely than other children to be irritable or to have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting. This happens within the first week after getting a dose of the vaccine. Serious problems: Studies in Australia and Mexico have shown a small increase in cases of intussusception within a week after the first dose of rotavirus vaccine. So far, this increase has not been seen in the United States, but it can't be ruled out. If the same risk were to exist here, we would expect to see 1 to 3 infants out of 100,000 develop intussusception within a week after the first dose of vaccine. What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high or severe allergic reaction fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it severe reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call or get the person to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the Vaccine Reporting System (V AERS). Y our doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice.The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.

ACERCA DE ESTA HOJA DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS Lea esta Hoja de informaci\u00f3n sobre vacunas (Vaccine Information Statement, VIS) antes de que su beb\u00e9 reciba sus inmunizaciones y despu\u00e9s, ll\u00e9vesela a su casa. Consulte a su m\u00e9dico si tiene alguna pregunta. Esta VIS le informa acerca de los beneficios y los riesgos de seis vacunas infantiles que se aplican de rutina. Tambi\u00e9n contiene informaci\u00f3n acerca de c\u00f3mo reportar una reacci\u00f3n adversa y del Programa Nacional de Compensaci\u00f3n por Lesiones Ocasionadas por Vacunas, adem\u00e1s de c\u00f3mo obtener m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre vacunas y enfermedades prevenibles mediante la vacunaci\u00f3n. (Para estas vacunas, tambi\u00e9n hay disponibles VIS individuales). C\u00d3MO FUNCIONAN LAS VACUNAS Inmunidad por las enfermedades: Cuando los ni\u00f1os contraen una enfermedad infecciosa, su sistema inmunitario, con frecuencia, produce \"anticuerpos\" protectores que impiden que contraigan la misma enfermedad nuevamente. Pero enfermarse no es divertido; puede ser peligroso o incluso mortal. Inmunidad por las vacunas: Las vacunas est\u00e1n hechas con las mismas bacterias o virus que provocan la enfermedad en cuesti\u00f3n, pero estos han sido debilitados o destruidos, o solo se han utilizado partes de ellos, para hacerlos seguros. El sistema inmunitario de un ni\u00f1o produce anticuerpos, tal como suceder\u00eda despu\u00e9s de la exposici\u00f3n a la enfermedad real. Esto significa que el ni\u00f1o desarrollar\u00e1 inmunidad de la misma manera, pero sin tener que enfermarse primero. BENEFICIOS DE LAS VACUNAS: \u00bfPOR QU\u00c9 VACUNARSE? A lo largo de los a\u00f1os, muchos ni\u00f1os han tenido lesiones o han muerto a causa de enfermedades en los Estados Unidos. En los a\u00f1os cincuenta, la poliomielitis provocaba par\u00e1lisis en alrededor de 37,000 personas y produc\u00eda la muerte de alrededor de 1700 todos los a\u00f1os. La enfermedad Hib era la causa principal de meningitis bacteriana en ni\u00f1os menores de 5 a\u00f1os. Antes de que hubiera una vacuna, alrededor de 15,000 personas mor\u00edan de difteria todos los a\u00f1os. Hasta 70,000 ni\u00f1os por a\u00f1o eran hospitalizados debido a la enfermedad por rotavirus. La hepatitis B puede provocar da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico y c\u00e1ncer en 1 de cada 4 ni\u00f1os que est\u00e1n infectados y el t\u00e9tanos mata a 1 de cada 5 ni\u00f1os que lo contraen. Gracias a las vacunas principalmente, estas enfermedades no son, ni con mucho, lo comunes que sol\u00edan ser. Pero tampoco han desaparecido. Algunas son comunes en otros pa\u00edses y, si dejamos de aplicar vacunas contra estas, regresar\u00e1n aqu\u00ed. Esto ya ha sucedido en algunas partes del mundo. Cuando las tasas de vacunaci\u00f3n bajan, las tasas de enfermedades suben.HOJA DE INFORMACI\u00d3N SOBRE VACUNAS Las primeras vacunas de su beb\u00e9 Lo que usted necesita saberMuchas de las Hojas informativas sobre vacunas est\u00e1n disponibles en espa\u00f1ol y en otros idiomas.

Difteria, t\u00e9tanos y (Interim) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-26 11/16/2012Las vacunas infantiles pueden prevenir estas 8 enfermedades 1. DIFTERIA Los signos y los s\u00edntomas incluyen un recubrimiento espeso en la parte posterior de la garganta que puede dificultar la respiraci\u00f3n. La difteria puede provocar problemas de respiraci\u00f3n e insuficiencia cardiaca. 2. T\u00c9TANOS (contracci\u00f3n de los m\u00fasculos de la mand\u00edbula) Los signos y los s\u00edntomas incluyen tensi\u00f3n dolorosa de los m\u00fasculos, en general, en todo el cuerpo.El t\u00e9tanos puede provocar rigidez de la mand\u00edbula, de modo tal que las v\u00edctimas no pueden abrir la boca ni tragar. 3. PERTUSSIS (tos ferina) Los signos y los s\u00edntomas incluyen accesos de tos violentos que pueden dificultar la ingesta de alimentos y bebidas, y la respiraci\u00f3n en beb\u00e9s. Estos accesos pueden prolongarse durante semanas. La pertussis puede provocar neumon\u00eda, convulsiones y da\u00f1o cerebral. 4. HIB (Haemophilus influenzae tipo b) Los signos y los s\u00edntomas pueden incluir problemas para respirar. Es posible que no haya signos ni s\u00edntomas en los casos leves. La Hib puede provocar meningitis (infecci\u00f3n del recubrimiento del cerebro y de la m\u00e9dula espinal); neumon\u00eda; infecciones de la sangre, las articulaciones, los huesos y el recubrimiento del coraz\u00f3n; da\u00f1o cerebral y sordera. 5. HEPATITIS B Los signos y los s\u00edntomas pueden incluir cansancio, diarrea y v\u00f3mitos, ictericia (piel u ojos amarillos) y dolor en los m\u00fasculos, las articulaciones y el est\u00f3mago. Sin embargo, en general, no presenta signos ni s\u00edntomas. La hepatitis B puede provocar da\u00f1o hep\u00e1tico y c\u00e1ncer de h\u00edgado. 6. POLIOMIELITIS Los signos y los s\u00edntomas pueden incluir una enfermedad similar a la gripe, o es posible que no presente signos ni s\u00edntomas. La poliomielitis puede provocar par\u00e1lisis (no poder mover un brazo o una pierna). 7. ENFERMEDAD NEUMOC\u00d3CICA Los signos y los s\u00edntomas incluyen fiebre, escalofr\u00edos, tos y dolor en el pecho.La enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica puede provocar meningitis (infecci\u00f3n del recubrimiento del cerebro y de la m\u00e9dula espinal), infecciones de la sangre, infecciones de o\u00eddo, neumon\u00eda, sordera y da\u00f1o cerebral. 8. ROTAVIRUS Los signos y los s\u00edntomas incluyen diarrea acuosa (en algunos casos severa), v\u00f3mitos, fiebre y dolor de est\u00f3mago.El rotavirus puede provocar deshidrataci\u00f3n y hacer que sea necesaria la hospitalizaci\u00f3n. Cualquiera de estas enfermedades puede provocar la muerte. \u00bfC\u00f3mo contraen los beb\u00e9s estas enfermedades? En general, por el contacto con otros ni\u00f1os o adultos que ya est\u00e1n infectados, en ocasiones, sin saber que lo est\u00e1n. Una madre con una infecci\u00f3n por hepatitis B tambi\u00e9n puede contagiar a su beb\u00e9 en el momento del parto. El t\u00e9tanos ingresa al cuerpo a trav\u00e9s de un corte o una herida; no se transmite de persona a persona.

Es posible que un ni\u00f1o que est\u00e1 enfermo el d\u00eda en que est\u00e9n programadas las vacunas deba volver para recibirlas otro d\u00eda. Hable con su m\u00e9dico... ... antes de recibir la vacuna DTaP si su hijo alguna vez tuvo alguna de estas reacciones despu\u00e9s de recibir una dosis de DTaP: - Una enfermedad en el cerebro o en el sistema nervioso en el t\u00e9rmino de 7 d\u00edas. - Llanto continuo durante 3 horas o m\u00e1s. - Convulsi\u00f3n o colapso. - Fiebre de m\u00e1s de 40 \u00baC (105 \u00b0F). ... antes de recibir la vacuna contra la poliomielitis si su hijo tiene una alergia a los antibi\u00f3ticos neomicina, estreptomicina o polimixina B que representa un riesgo para la vida. ... antes de recibir la vacuna contra la hepatitis B si su hijo tiene una alergia a la levadura que representa un riesgo para la vida. ... antes de recibir la vacuna contra el rotavirus si su hijo: - Tiene inmunodeficiencia combinada severa (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, SCID). - Tiene un sistema inmunitario d\u00e9bil por alg\u00fan otro motivo. - Tiene problemas digestivos. - Recientemente ha recibido una transfusi\u00f3n de sangre u otro producto de la sangre. - Alguna vez tuvo una invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal (obstrucci\u00f3n intestinal que se trata en un hospital). ... antes de recibir la PCV13 o la vacuna DTaP si su hijo alguna vez tuvo una reacci\u00f3n severa despu\u00e9s de cualquier vacuna que contenga toxoide dift\u00e9rico (como DTaP). Multi-vaccine VIS - Spanish (11/16/2012) p. 3 of 4Riesgos Las vacunas pueden causar efectos secundarios, como cualquier medicamento. La mayor\u00eda de las reacciones a las vacunas son leves: sensibilidad, enrojecimiento o hinchaz\u00f3n donde se administr\u00f3 la inyecci\u00f3n; o fiebre leve. Estas se producen en alrededor de 1 de cada 4 ni\u00f1os. Aparecen inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de administrar la inyecci\u00f3n y desaparecen en el t\u00e9rmino de uno o dos d\u00edas. Otras reacciones: Las vacunas individuales infantiles han sido asociadas, en particular, con otros problemas leves o con problemas moderados o graves: Vacuna DTaP Problemas leves: Molestias (hasta 1 de cada 3 ni\u00f1os); cansancio o falta de apetito (hasta 1 de cada 10 ni\u00f1os); v\u00f3mitos (hasta 1 de cada 50 ni\u00f1os); hinchaz\u00f3n de todo el brazo o toda la pierna durante 1 a 7 d\u00edas (hasta 1 de cada 30 ni\u00f1os); por lo general, despu\u00e9s de la 4.a o 5.a dosis. Problemas moderados: Convulsiones (1 de cada 14,000 ni\u00f1os); llanto continuo durante 3 horas o m\u00e1s (hasta 1 de cada 1000 ni\u00f1os); fiebre de m\u00e1s de 40 \u00baC (105 \u00b0F) (1 de cada 16,000 ni\u00f1os). Problemas graves: Se han reportado convulsiones a largo plazo, coma, disminuci\u00f3n del estado de consciencia y da\u00f1o cerebral permanente. Estos problemas se producen con tan poca frecuencia que es dif\u00edcil determinar si realmente fueron provocados por la vacuna o si simplemente se produjeron con posterioridad por casualidad. Vacuna contra la poliomielitis / Vacuna contra la hepatitis B / Vacuna contra Hib Estas vacunas no han sido asociadas con otros problemas leves ni con problemas moderados o graves. Vacuna antineumoc\u00f3cica Problemas leves: Durante estudios de la vacuna, algunos ni\u00f1os se sintieron molestos o somnolientos, o perdieron el apetito. Vacuna contra el rotavirus Problemas leves: Los ni\u00f1os que reciben la vacuna contra el rotavirus tienen una probabilidad levemente mayor que otros ni\u00f1os de presentar irritabilidad o de tener diarrea o v\u00f3mitos leves temporales. Esto ocurre en el t\u00e9rmino de la primera semana despu\u00e9s de recibir una dosis de la vacuna. Problemas graves: Estudios realizados en Australia y M\u00e9xico han demostrado un peque\u00f1o aumento en los casos de invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal en el t\u00e9rmino de una semana despu\u00e9s de la primera dosis de la vacuna contra el rotavirus. Hasta la fecha, este aumento no se ha observado en los Estados Unidos; pero no puede descartarse. Si aqu\u00ed existiera el mismo riesgo, se prever\u00eda observar que entre 1 y 3 de cada 100,000 ni\u00f1os desarrollen invaginaci\u00f3n intestinal en el t\u00e9rmino de una semana despu\u00e9s de la primera dosis de la vacuna. \u00bfQu\u00e9 sucede si mi hijo tiene un problema grave? \u00bfA qu\u00e9 debo prestar atenci\u00f3n? Debe prestar atenci\u00f3n a cualquier aspecto que le preocupe, como signos de reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa, fiebre muy alta o cambios en la conducta. Los signos de una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa pueden incluir urticaria, hinchaz\u00f3n de la cara y la garganta, dificultades para respirar, pulso acelerado, mareos y debilidad. Estos podr\u00edan comenzar entre algunos minutos y algunas horas despu\u00e9s de la vacuna. \u00bfQu\u00e9 debo hacer? Si piensa que es una reacci\u00f3n al\u00e9rgica severa u otra emergencia que no puede esperar, llame al 9-1-1 o lleve a la persona al hospital m\u00e1s cercano. De lo contrario, llame a su m\u00e9dico. Luego, la reacci\u00f3n debe ser reportada al Sistema de reporte de eventos adversos derivados de las vacunas (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS). Su m\u00e9dico puede presentar este reporte, o puede hacerlo usted mismo a trav\u00e9s del sitio web del VAERS en, www.vaers.hhs.gov, o llamando al 1-800-822-7967.Programa Nacional de Compensaci\u00f3n por Lesiones Causadas por Vacunas En 1986, se cre\u00f3 el Programa Nacional de Compensaci\u00f3n por Lesiones Causadas por Vacunas (National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, VICP). Las personas que consideren que pueden haber tenido lesiones ocasionadas por una vacuna pueden informarse sobre el programa y sobre c\u00f3mo presentar un reclamo llamando al 1-800-338-2382 o visitando el sitio web del VICP en: www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation.

In an attempt to reduce the confu - sion over different strengths that have been blamed for past overdoses, some manufacturers are voluntarily offer - ing only the children. Until now, liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants has that as right now both concentrations of liquid acetaminophen are in cir - culation. Before giving the medica - tion, parents and caregivers need to know whether they have the less con - centrated version or the older, more concentrated medication. FDA is con - cerned that infants could be given too much or too little of the medicine if the different concentrations of acet - aminophen are confused. acetaminophen\" says Holquist, director of FDA's Division of Medical Error Prevention and Analysis. Here's what the agency wants par - ents and caregivers to do: Read the Drug Facts label on the package very carefully to concentration of the liquid acetaminophen, the dosage, and the directions for use. Do not depend on a banner proclaiming that the product is \"new.\" Some medicines with the old concentration also have this headline on their packaging. Use only the dosing device provided with the purchased product in order you're both talking about the same concentration. Overdosing Has Been a Risk An April 2011 report from FDA's Cen - ter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) found that confusion caused by different concentrations of liq - uid acetaminophen for infants and children was leading to overdoses that made infants seriously ill, with some dying from from 80 mg per 0.8mL or 80 mg per 1 mL to be the same con - centration as the liquid acetamino - new dosing directions and 2 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration DECEMBER 2 011 Consumer Health Information www.fda.gov/consumer and other Consumer Updates at www.fda.gov/ up for free e-mail subscriptions at www.fda.gov/ consumer/consumerenews.htmlmay have a new dosing device in the box, such as an oral syringe. But this is a voluntary change and some of the older, stronger concen - trations of acetaminophen and remain available. \"There is still some on store shelves; there is still some in homes; and there is still some in distribution,\" says Holquist. Why does this pose a danger? If a pediatrician prescribes a 5 mL dose of - uid acetaminophen, but the parents mL dose of the more concentrated the might not receive enough medication to fight a fever, she Drug Safety avoid confusion and potential dosing of acetaminophen. What Should You Do? Adding to the confusion is the fact that that the box and the bottle may look much the same for both old and new versions of the medication, Holquist says.

If the package says \"160 mg per 5 mL\" or \"160 mg (in mL)\", concentrated This medication should come syringe to help you measure the dose. If the package says \"80 mg per 0.8 mL\" or \"80 mg per 1 mL,\" then this is the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen.

As a new parent (or parent-to-be), it's hard not to hear the great debate in parenting circles these days\u2014do vaccines cause autism? If not, what causes autism and why is it on the rise? Let's start at the beginning\u2014just what is autism? Q: What is autism? Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is really a collection of several disorders that have three abnormal areas are other categories that fall under the ASD umbrella. There is a very broad range of severity within ASD. A child may have normal intelligence and language, but be socially awkward and have panic attacks if his sandwich is cut in triangles instead of squares. Or a child may appear out of touch with reality and spend his entire day rocking and flapping his hands. Both children have ASD. As you might suspect, children with severe problems as in classic autism are diagnosed much earlier than kids who can com - municate but have trouble with social skills, as in Asperger's Syn - drome. Children are usually diagnosed by 18-24 months of age when lan - guage delays are obvious. Many children with long before that time. Some early clues include: not smiling back at people, poor eye contact, not imitating, not gesturing (waving bye-bye), not responding to being called by name, and not trying to communicate/connect/engage with other people by 1 year of age. There also are some unusual behaviors. Cuddling may not be sooth - ing. In fact, an autistic child may get very upset by being touched. Bright lights and noises often bother them. Because they are bugged by the outside world, they may turn inward and comfort interest in playing with toys. Or they may play in an odd way\u2014 such as using a phone as a comfort object. Bottom line: Children with autism have autism long before their first birthdays, even though their \"official\" diagnosis usually occurs in their second year of life. Q: I have a friend whose child has autism. She said he was \"perfectly normal\" until he was about 18 months old. Does this happen? A small minority of ASD children have completely normal mile - stones and then regress, which is known as \"late onset autism.\" These likely have a distinct genetic abnormality that turns on or off without any trigger. However, for most kids with ASD, parents and doctors just miss (or dismiss) the early signs in the first year of life and the child's atypi - cal development only becomes apparent at 18 Doctors rely first-timers) don't know what is normal and what isn't. The mother of one of my ASD patients told me that she only real - ized how unusual her son's development was after she watched her second child, without ASD, breeze through her milestones. Even the most vocal ASD mom of all, Jenny McCarthy, agrees. Her son was 5 months old when he first smiled at her (that's abnormal), when all of her friends' babies smiled at 2 months of age (that's normal). Some parents report that their ASD child spoke a few words and then \"lost\" the ability to say them. If you delve a bit deeper, the child may have randomly said a few things, but was not consistently using words like \"juice\" or \"no\" to communicate his needs. There is growing research in language development that looks at brain anatomy. Primitive brain parts control early language develop - ment from birth to 18 months. At 18 to 24 months, the mature brain parts turn on and language takes off. With autistic children, mature language does not take off. But from a parent's perspective, it may look like a loss of Answers & Smart Advice About Your Shots Dr. Brown received her medical degree from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; she did her pediatric residency at Harvard Medical School/Boston Children's Hospital. In private practice since 1995, Dr. Brown is perhaps best known as the coauthor of the 411 parenting series \u2014 Expecting 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Pregnancy, Baby 411, and Toddler 411 (Windsor Peak Press). In response to the recent media attention given to vaccines, other vaccines, Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) has reprinted a special excerpt from Baby 411 that answers these questions and more. IAC thanks Dr. Brown for this clearly written information, but mostly, we are grateful for safe and effective vaccines . Immunization Action St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) abnormal brain development in a genetically predisposed baby? Maybe. And that exposure may happen at or shortly after conception, before a mother even knows she is pregnant. The embryo has a critical period of brain development at 20-24 days after conception. That is when the developing brain is most sensitive to injury. Studies done by the Environmental Working Group have detected cord blood, so pregnant moms are exposed to a variety of toxins. Could one of these be the autism trigger? We don't know. Viral infections during pregnancy a environmental environmental trigger? Researchers scientists have taken a long, hard look at vaccines\u2014and there is conclusive evidence that vaccine exposure is NOT the turn-on switch for autism.6 Bottom line: There's evidence that of certain proteins in their brains. So, whatever the trigger is (if there is one), it has been fired before the baby even enters the world. Prematurity: A developing brain is quite vulnerable. Premature, very low birth-weight babies (under three pounds) have a 25 percent chance developing an autism spectrum disorder.7 Older parents: Another possible reason of having babies at a later age. Moms who conceive after the age of 40 have a 30 percent increased risk of having a child with autism. Dads who conceive after the age of 40 have a 50 percent increased risk of children were conceived at least three years after their sibling was born closer-spaced and found after the birth of the first-born child were THREE times more likely to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Babies conceived from 12 to 23 months after the birth of the first-born child had almost two times the risk of ASD. And, even babies conceived 23 to 35 months after the first- born child had a slightly greater risk of ASD. Unfortunately, the researchers have no idea why the odds are greater when the spacing it's because a woman's stores have not had enough time to be replenished. Or maybe women who have put off parenthood until later in life have more closely spaced babies\u2014 and parental age itself is a risk factor for having a child with an ASD. This study alone should not necessarily influence your decision on how long to wait between pregnancies. However, the current recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is to wait at least 18 to 23 months between pregnancies for a mother's be harder to diagnose early on. Reviewing home movies of a child once the diagnosis is made often shows that early signs are overlooked.1 Q: OK, so what causes autism? The million-dollar question. In the 1980s, one in 10,000 kids was diagnosed with autism. Today, one in 150 American 8-year-olds has some form of autism. Boys outnumber girls four to one. The United States is not the only coun - try seeing this trend. It is increasingly diagnosed worldwide. For starters, is it really an epidemic? Or, are more people being diag - nosed? Many children who were diagnosed with mental retardation 30 years ago are children who are diagnosed with classic autism today. And mildly disabled ASD kids today are children who never would have had a diagnosis 30 years ago. Those verbal, but socially awkward, children account for the majority of new ASD cases. Here are the hottest areas of autism research today: Genetics: There is genetics plays a role. Autism runs in families. I have a family in my practice and all four children have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum. Studying twins is an obvious way to detect genetic disorders. If one identical twin has autism, up to 90 percent of the time, so will the other twin. To date, studies suggest there is more than just one \"autism gene\"; there appear to be several. ASD children have several different abnormalities with their DNA. However the X chromosome is one of interest because of the high prevalence of boys with ASDs.2 Fragile X Syndrome, which is a known genetic cause of autism, also points to a defective X chromosome in ASD. MECP2 gene located on the X chromosome.3 We also know that kids with autism and defects on Chromosome 11 have dysfunctional \"neurexin 1 looking into how this defective protein affects and infant brain growth. may help in genetic growth: ASD children have problems with Babies are born with immature like information superhighway. In the normally growing brain, some branches of this superhighway get \"pruned.\" In the autistic brain, pruning to defective. explain why babies who are autistic have abnormally rapid head growth under 1 year of age. No one has yet figured out what causes that defective nerve growth. Of note, boys with ASD have higher levels of hormones (insulin-like growth factor) that may contribute larger head size, weight, and body Answers & The to a way to prevent autism ... but we aren't there yet. Vaccines Q: Why do you care whether I vaccinate my child or not? For starters, we want your baby to be protected. But we also want you to realize that the decision to vaccinate your child impacts the health of other children in the community. Choosing NOT to vaccinate your child is choosing to put your child AND your community's children at risk. As a parent, you want to make the right choices to protect your child. I want you to ask questions. I want you to be informed. And I want you to get your child vaccinated. YOUR decision impacts ALL children. Why? There are two critical points for vaccination to work: 1. You need to be vaccinated. 2. Your neighbor needs to be vaccinated. This concept is called herd immunity. And yes, you are a member of a herd. When 90 to 95 percent of \"the herd\" is protected, it is nearly impossible a germ to cause an epidemic. Think of germs as rain. Vaccination is a raincoat. Even with a raincoat on, you can still get wet. You need an umbrella, too. The share their umbrella when it rains. But society can only buy umbrellas TOGETHER. And raincoats aren't made for newborns\u2014they need umbrellas! Some parenting decisions have little or no impact on the community at large. Deciding whether or not your child eats organic baby food, goes to preschool, or sleeps in a family bed is entirely up to you\u2014 your decision only affects your child. However, your decision whether or not to vaccinate your child affects all our kids. If you are a parent who is considering delaying or no entire country will see these horrible diseases of bygone days return. Fortunately, very few parents decide to do this. What is most concerning today is that there are pockets of under-vaccinated children. Birds of a feather flock together. Like-minded parents who don't vaccinate their kids tend to live in the same community and send their kids to the same schools. With lower immunization rates, there is no herd immunity. We have these \"Ground this true? No. Parents also hear that vaccinations cause multiple asthma, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). safety adverse No one wants to increase autism rates.One small case report of only eight patients in 1998 led a research group to feel that the combination measles, mumps, and rubella try to find the article online because the journal that published it later retracted it when a former member of the research lab revealed that the data reported in the study was fabricated!12 Twelve years later, the lead author lost his license to practice medicine in England and was accused of fraud. The whole thing was a hoax. Before this came to light, several reputable scientists tried to duplicate measles epidemics occurred in the United Kingdom and the United States as a result of these unfounded claims. Bottom line: Don't base health decisions for your child on one research study or what the media says! Talk to your child's doctor about any vaccine safety concerns. Q: If the MMR vaccine doesn't cause autism, why is the diagnosis made around the same time as the vaccination? One of the criteria used to make a diagnosis of autism is a language delay. Because children do not have significant expressive language under a year of age, doctors have to wait until 15 to 18 months to confirm a language delay and make the diagnosis. That's about the same time as the MMR vaccination, which leads some parents to Q: heard mercury preservative is few remain. Preservatives uncontaminated. popular of to months by 2001. This deserves repeating: YOUR young baby will not be getting vaccines that contain mercury (thimerosal) as a preservative. The one exception is the influenza vaccine that is found in multi-dose vials that need a preservative to prevent contamination. Influenza vaccine that is packaged in single dose vials does not need a preservative and many clinics choose to use these individual vials with the youngest patients. Remember, it's very important that children get vaccinated against influenza each fall or winter beginning when they are 6 months old. Despite the fact that most persists about vaccines mercury and links to autism. This speculation continues even after the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a conclusive report in 2004 negating any association between vaccines and autism. (The IOM spent four years studying both the mercury question and the MMR combo vaccine question and published a series of eight on the subject.) A quick & of 6the anticipated flu strains. Since millions of doses of flu vaccine are needed every year, the most efficient way to produce the shot is in multi-dose vials, which require a preservative. Hence, some flu flu the preservative thimerosal. However, there are single-dose preparations of flu vaccine that are mercury preservative-free. These can be given to young children and pregnant women. Ask your doctor for a thimerosal-free flu vaccine if you are concerned. Even though thimerosal is safe, it would be all vaccines to be thimerosal preservative-free\u2014this would put any concerns to rest. However, the technology just isn't there yet. The Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University has a chart online that tracks any thimerosal content in vaccines: thimerosal process or as a preservative. Reality Check: Worried about child's flu vaccine? Consider this: A tuna fish sandwich has five times more mercury than a thimerosal-preserved flu vaccine. 15 And the type of mercury (methylmercury) found in tuna is the one that has health concerns. Also, a baby who is exclusively breastfed for six months of life consumes about 0.36 mg of methylmercury from breast milk. That's 15 times the quantity of ethylmercury in one flu vaccine! Bottom line: As a doc, I am much more concerned about your baby's mercury exposure from the environment than what's in a flu shot. Here's a look at the numbers: Product Amount of Mercury Type of Mercury Tuna, 5.6 oz can 0.115 mg Methyl Breast milk, 1 liter Q: Does thimerosal cause autism? No. The Institute of Medicine reached this conclusion in 2004. What proof do we have? Thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines since 2001, but the rates of autism are still skyrocketing. A 2008 survey of autism rates in California confirms that mercury is essentially out and autism rates are still going up. If thimerosal was the cause and it was removed from vaccines seven years ago, autism rates would be going down by now. Why? Because autism spectrum disorders are usually diagnosed by 3 years of age. By now, any reduction in autism should have been obvious if suit shortly thereafter. However, autism going up too. Mad Hatter's Disease (mercury poisoning) and autism are very different disorders (see chart in next column). A study of 100,000 kids in England compared those receiving thimerosal-containing vaccines to those who did not. The ones who had the t-free shots had HIGHER rates of autism.17take the alcohol family. Methanol is anti-freeze; ethanol is a Bud Light. Keep this in mind when we discuss mercury. We are all exposed to small amounts of mercury. The type of mercury that has raised health concerns is called methylmercury. High concentrations of methylmercury can be found in tuna, swordfish and shark from contaminated waters. The information known about mercury poisoning comes from unfortunate communities that have experienced it. Example: There is a large amount of data from the Faroe Islands, near Iceland. The people there would eat whale seemed to have lower attention, and language tests than their unexposed peers. (They were get into the brain\u2014it takes almost two months to break down in the body. Ethylmercury (the type of mercury that was previously used as a vaccine preservative) is a large molecule that cannot enter the brain and is rapidly eliminated from the body within a week. Because of the increased number of vaccinations that children get, the potential cumulative exposure to mercury became a concern in 1999. There are three federal groups that set standards for acceptable daily mercury exposure (the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], the Food and Drug [FDA], and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Registry). When the higher than set the EPA only (the other groups' standards were higher). As a result of these findings, the Public Health Service (which includes the FDA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a joint statement as a as soon as possible.14 This was issued in 1999 before scientists had an opportunity to study the potential health effects of thimerosal-containing vaccines. Numerous studies relationship between vaccines, either with or without thimerosal, and the development of autism or other neurologic problems in children. Q: I heard that I should still ask my doctor if the vaccines for my baby are thimerosal-free. What do you suggest? We think you should ask as many questions as you need to feel comfortable. Remember that since 2001, most childhood vaccines given to infants and children went thimerosal (mercury) preservative- free. If your doctor has a 2001 vintage vaccine vial sitting on the shelf (which would be expired by now), he needs to re-stock. To give you some perspective, my practice buys its vaccine supply on a monthly basis. Why does flu vaccine need thimerosal or any other preservative? First, understand the flu vaccine is reformulated every year to reflect Clear Answers & Smart Advice About Your Baby's of 6Why enhances adequate immune response. Are there any health concerns with aluminum in vaccines? No. There is significantly less aluminum in vaccines than what babies are exposed to in the environment. Both the National Vaccine Program Office and the World Health Organization have determined that the aluminum content in the childhood vaccination series is safe. Does aluminum poisoning cause autism? No. People with aluminum poisoning have bone problems (osteomalacia) and anemia, impairment. been proposed as the cause of Alzheimer's Disease. To date, however, there is little evidence that aluminum causes that disorder.21 How much aluminum is in vaccines? Very little. If your baby follows the standard immunization schedule, he is exposed to about four to six milligrams (mg) of aluminum at six months of life. By comparison, he's also exposed to 10 mg of aluminum if he is breastfed, 40 mg if he is fed cow's milk-based formula, or 120 mg if he is fed soy formula. None of these are very large amounts, by the way. To put things in perspective, there are about 200 mg of aluminum in a standard antacid tablet. In fact, the average adult ingests seven to nine milligrams of aluminum every day. Here's a look at how much aluminum is in breast milk/formula, compared with DTaP/IPV/HIB vaccine 1.5 mg/dose Is it a good idea to space out vaccinations that contain aluminum salts? No. Since aluminum-containing vaccines do not cause any health risk, separating or spacing out these vaccines has no benefit. In fact, there is a risk to spacing out the vaccines\u2014your baby will go unprotected against real vaccine-preventable disease. A 2007 study showed that children between 7 and 10 years of age who got those mercury-containing vaccines (before 2001) have no significant differences in tests of attention and processing information. Although the study did not look specifically at autism, it showed that mercury preservatives did not make much of an impact on brain functions in general. A follow-up study that specifically addresses autism is underway.18 Did thimerosal cause autism? Notice the differences between autism Are there other additives in the vaccines? Yes. And you should know about them. Vaccines contain the active ingredients that provide immunity. But there inactive ingredients that improve potency and prevent contamination. Below is a list of additives and why they are there. These products are present in trace amounts and none harmful (bacteria, click on \"Bonus Material\") for a list of ingredients for the routine childhood vaccination series. Q: Why is aluminum in vaccines? Now that the mercury (thimerosal) saga is coming to an end, anti- vaccine crusaders have come up with a new bad guy: aluminum. Yes, trace amounts of aluminum salts are used in some childhood vaccines. Here's all you need to know (and more) about aluminum. Bottom line: We are not worried about it. Aluminum is everywhere. It's the most common metal in our earth's crust. So it is naturally present in our water, soil, and even in the air. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, flour, cereal, dairy products, and yes, even baby formula and breast milk ... all contain some aluminum. Do you wear It's in there, Smart Advice About Your Baby's Shots page 5 of 6 Reality Check: If vaccines contain ingredients like aluminum or formaldehyde, wouldn't it be better if vaccine makers got rid of these additives? Shouldn't vaccines be is amounts of preservatives or additives like aluminum. And your baby is exposed to many of these ingredients every day ... simply by eating or breathing. are used to sterilize the vaccine fluid so your child doesn't get something like flesh-eating Strep bacteria when he gets his shots. We know when you think of formaldehyde, you think of that ever-present smell wafting from the anatomy lab in high school. But what you probably don't know is that formaldehyde is also a naturally occurring substance in your body. And if you use baby shampoo, paper towels or mascara, or have carpeting in your home, you've been exposed to formaldehyde. The small amount used in vaccines is not a health concern.23 Q: Is it true that anti-freeze is used in vaccines? No. Antifreeze similar name, polyethylene glycol (PEG), is used in the production process to purify vaccines. PEG is or use alternative vaccination schedule? answer: No. The CDC publishes a recommended vaccine schedule for American children. Many, many doctors, scientists, and researchers work together with the CDC to decide what is the best timing to give shots. The goal: Protect babies as soon as it is safe and effective to do so. This schedule was not created out of thin air. Between anti-vaccine activists shouting \"too many shots, too soon\" and Dr. Bob Sears hawking his book, new parents wonder if it would somehow be safer to wait truth about alternative vaccination schedules: They are all fantasy. There is absolutely no research that says delaying certain shots Schedule\" all by himself. He with iVillage, he commented, \"My schedule doesn't have any research behind it. No one has ever studied a big group of kids using my schedule to determine if it's safe or if it has any benefits.\" A 2010 study actually did evaluate children whose vaccinations were delayed and found absolutely no difference in their development compared with children who had received their shots on time. I'd much rather follow a schedule that has been extensively researched for both safety and effectiveness by experts in the field of infectious diseases. What we do know about alternative vaccination schedules is that delaying shots is playing Russian roulette with your child. The simple truth is that you are leaving your child unprotected, at a time when she is the most vulnerable. We realize that parents who choose to delay or opt out vaccines are not bad parents. They are scared parents. What we are trying to help you realize is that the fear you should have is for the diseases that vaccines prevent. If you are on the fence about vaccinations, please take the time to research the disease\u2014and talk to your child's doctor.Q: If I want to do a staggered how should I do it? a consultation with your own pediatrician to discuss what both of you feel comfortable with doing. Remember, the ultimate goal is to have your child vaccinated in a timely manner. of lawsuit against the government (called the \"Omnibus Autism Proceedings\"), one child, Hannah Poling, received a monetary settlement. The court did not hear her case. Hannah's case was being reviewed to serve as one of the test cases for a suit to represent 5,000 families who believe vaccines caused their child's the process, it was determined that Poling did not represent a test case because had rare, underlying genetic mitochondrial disorder that caused her deterioration and autism. For rare kids like her, any stress could have caused her to deteriorate. This is the equivalent of being born with an aneurysm, a ticking time bomb that could go off at any moment. Although she was not diagnosed prior to being vaccinated, experts recommend that even children with known mitochondrial disorders still be vaccinated. Bottom line: The government did NOT concede that vaccines cause autism in the Poling case. Citations 1. Maestro S. Psychopathology . al. Nature 2003;34:27-9. 3. Chahrour M, et al. JL, et al.

Su profesional de la salud le debe recordar cu\u00e1ndo necesita las pr\u00f3ximas dosis. Si usted no est\u00e1 seguro llame a la cl\u00ednica o al consultorio de su profesional de la salud para averiguar cu\u00e1ndo debe llevar de vuelta a su hijo. Las dosis no se deben dar demasiado cerca la una de la otra porque no da tiempo a que se forme la inmunidad. Por otro lado, tampoco hay que demorar ni atrasarse porque durante ese tiempo su hijo no est\u00e1 protegido contra estas enfermedades. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si falto a una cita? \u00bfTiene que empezar mi beb\u00e9 todas las vacunas de nuevo? No. Si pasa por alto algunas dosis no es necesario empezar de nuevo. Su profesional de la salud continuar\u00e1 donde dej\u00f3. \u00bfC\u00f3mo me mantengo al tanto de las vacunas de mi beb\u00e9? Su profesional de la salud le debe dar un comprobante de vacunaci\u00f3n personal de las vacunas que le pusieron a su hijo. P\u00eddalo si no se lo dan.

Si a su hijo no le pusieron alguna vacuna (o no le pusieron ninguna) este es el mejor momento para empezar.\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si no puedo pagar para que vacunen a mi hijo? Por lo general, las vacunas son gratuitas o de bajo costo para los ni\u00f1os cuando las familias no las pueden pagar.

Las vacunas protegen a su hijo contra enfermedades serias al estimular al sistema inmunol\u00f3gico a que produzca anticuerpos contra ciertos virus o bacterias. La mayor\u00eda de las vacunas se dan como inyecciones. \u00bfContra cu\u00e1les enfermedades protegen las vacunas? Las vacunas protegen contra enfermedades como sarampi\u00f3n, paperas, rub\u00e9ola, gripe (o influenza), hepatitis B, hepatitis A, poliomielitis, t\u00e9tanos, tos ferina, varicela, rotavirus y m\u00e1s. Las vacunas no pueden proteger a los ni\u00f1os contra enfermedades menores, como resfriados, pero s\u00ed pueden evitar que tengan muchas enfermedades serias. \u00bfAcaso no se dicen todas estas cosas sobre las enfermedades s\u00f3lo para asustar a los padres y hacer que vacunen a sus beb\u00e9s? No. Estas enfermedades s\u00ed pueden hacer da\u00f1o y causar la muerte de ni\u00f1os en Estados Unidos. Por ejemplo, la tos ferina es una enfermedad peligrosa para los beb\u00e9s. Entre 1997 y 2000 se informaron cerca de 30,000 casos de tos ferina y 62 de ellos resultaron en muertes. En s\u00f3lo el 2003 se informaron 11,647 casos y 18 muertes de tos ferina. La gripe tambi\u00e9n afecta gravemente a los ni\u00f1os. Durante la temporada de gripe de 2003 a 2004, 40 estados informaron 152 muertes relacionadas a la gripe de ni\u00f1os y adolescentes menores de 18 a\u00f1os de edad.No conozco a nadie que haya tenido sarampi\u00f3n o rub\u00e9ola. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 necesita mi beb\u00e9 estas vacunas? T al vez crea que el sarampi\u00f3n y la rub\u00e9ola no son una amenaza hoy en d\u00eda porque no ve ni oye mucho acerca de ellas, pero todav\u00eda existen. Estas enfermedades son comunes en otras partes del mundo y est\u00e1n a s\u00f3lo un viaje en avi\u00f3n de distancia. Si dejamos de vacunar contra estas enfermedades muchas m\u00e1s personas ser\u00e1n infectadas. Vacunar a su hijo lo mantendr\u00e1 seguro. \u00bfNo hay alguna otra manera de proteger a mi beb\u00e9 contra estas enfermedades, aparte de las vacunas? No. Dar pecho ofrece inmunidad temporal contra algunas infecciones menores, como resfriados, pero no es un medio eficaz para proteger a los ni\u00f1os contra las enfermedades espec\u00edficas que se pueden prevenir con las vacunas. Asimismo, las vitaminas no protegen contra las bacterias y los virus espec\u00edficos que causan estas enfermedades serias. Por supuesto, despu\u00e9s de tener la enfermedad uno, por lo general, tiene inmunidad contra ella. Algunos padres piensan que tener la enfermedad \"natural\" es mejor que una vacuna \"artificial\". Algunos hasta hacen \"fiestas\" de varicela para que sus hijos se la contagien. Sin embargo, el precio que se paga por la enfermedad natural puede incluir par\u00e1lisis, retraso mental, c\u00e1ncer del h\u00edgado, sordera, ceguera y hasta la muerte. \u00a1No cabe duda de que la vacuna es una mejor opci\u00f3n! \u00bfSon seguras las vacunas? Las vacunas son seguras y los cient\u00edficos se esfuerzan constantemente en que sean todav\u00eda m\u00e1s seguras. T odas las vacunas pasan por muchas pruebas antes de ser autorizadas y su seguridad se sigue controlando todo el tiempo en que la vacuna est\u00e1 en uso. La mayor\u00eda de los efectos secundarios de las vacunas son menores, como dolor en el lugar donde se aplic\u00f3 la vacuna o un poco de fiebre. Estos efectos secundarios no duran mucho tiempo y se pueden tratar. Las reacciones serias ocurren muy rara vez. El peque\u00f1\u00edsimo riesgo de que haya una reacci\u00f3n seria a una vacuna se tiene que comparar con el riesgo muy real de contagiarse una enfermedad peligrosa que se puede prevenir con una vacuna. Hable con el profesional de la salud de su hijo si tiene alguna pregunta o inquietud. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa si mi beb\u00e9 est\u00e1 resfriado o tiene fiebre, o est\u00e1 tomando antibi\u00f3ticos? \u00bfDe todas maneras lo pueden vacunar? S\u00ed. Si su hijo tiene una enfermedad leve, un poco de fiebre o est\u00e1 tomando antibi\u00f3ticos de todas maneras lo pueden vacunar. Hable con el profesional de la salud de su hijo si tiene alguna pregunta. \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas veces tengo que llevar a mi beb\u00e9 para que lo vacunen? Se requieren al menos cinco visitas antes de los dos a\u00f1os de edad, pero las visitas se pueden hacer coincidir con los ex\u00e1menes del beb\u00e9 sano. Se debe aplicar la primera vacuna a su beb\u00e9 (la de la hepatitis B) al poco tiempo de nacer, mientras que todav\u00eda est\u00e1 en el hospital. Durante los primeros dos a\u00f1os hay que llevarlo varias veces para vacunarlo porque hay 14 enfermedades contra las que se puede proteger a su beb\u00e9 y la mayor\u00eda de ellas requieren varias dosis de la vacuna para tener mejor protecci\u00f3n. ?you don't immunize your childWe strongly discuss any concerns you have with a trusted healthcare provider or call the immunization coordinator at your local or state health department.

Pertussis or \"whooping cough\" is an extremely dangerous disease not easily treated and can result in permanent brain damage or death. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of outbreaks dangerous and very contagious. It is still common in many countries and is easily brought into the United States by vacationers parents in the United States and abroad has led to a growing number of children and teens who are under-vaccinated and thus, cases the across this country and worldwide. Chickenpox is very contagious. Before the development of a vaccine, about 100 people died every year in the United States from chickenpox. Most were previously healthy. Children with chickenpox need to be kept out of day care or school for a week or more so they don't spread the disease to others. Children diseases on to babies who are too young to be fully immunized. Unvaccinated children pose a threat to children and adults who can't be immunized for medical reasons. This includes people with leukemia and other cancers, immune system problems, and people or suppress their immune system. Unvaccinated children can infect the small percentage of children who do not immune response vaccination. During disease outbreaks, unimmunized from school or child care until the outbreak is over.
