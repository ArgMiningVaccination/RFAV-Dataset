The control of the quality of the production of such medications is strict and the assessment of the benefitrisk ratio of these interventions is regulated by official recommendations which follow an evidencebased approach. Ayurveda Indian medicine has used Mucuna Pruriens (MP) for the treatment of PD since ancient times. MP includes LD as an active moiety, among many others. A literature search was conducted between 19782012 with the keywords Parkinson's disease, ayurveda or mucuna pruriens. MP antagonized the effects of 6OHDA lesions in rats and when administered chronically it showed lower dyskinetic potential compared to LDOPA. MP also reduced Parkinsonian symptoms in an MPTP treated monkey with less dyskinesias compared to LDOPA. Four clinical trials of MP for PD treatment were found. Initially they were openlabel, uncontrolled studies, suggesting that MP might reduce parkinsonism severity. One doubleblind randomized crossover study was conducted in 8 PD patients, employing acute challenges of levodopa or MP. It showed that the effect of MP had a faster onset than LD, with shorter latencies to peak and increased ontime. No other mediumterm (i.e., 6 months) randomizedcontrolled trials (RCT) are available. According to the MDS EBM taskforce working procedures, an intervention is considered as \"efficacious\" when there is at least one high quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) showing a positive effect on studied outcomes with no conflicting data from other RCTs. Based on these premises, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the efficacy of MP in the treatment of PD. Thus its use in clinical practice remains open to investigation. It must also be emphasized that various MP formulations can be used, raising concerns about their quality, which is difficult to control, as regulation is limited. Impurities or variations in active moieties, can lead to unexpected adverse drug reactions. In conclusion, the use of MP in PD treatment remains open to investigation and thus cannot be recommended for clinical use", "sitename": "InTech", "date": "2019-05-02", "cleaned_text": ": ||P\u00e9rez Lloret, S., Rey M.
