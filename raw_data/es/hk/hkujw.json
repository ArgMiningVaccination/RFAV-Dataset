Argentina ABSTRACT Background: Phyllanthus amarus is a herbal several diseases A systematic chronically and excessively of chronic of the herb the stomach and the duodenum of adult Wistar rats of both Material Rats, with average weight of 200g, were divided into three groups of eight animals each: A (P amarus at a single dose of 400mg/kg body weight daily for thirty days through an orogastric tube); B (P. amarus at a single dose of 800mg/kg body weight daily through the same route and period), and C (controls, receiving equal volume of distilled water in identical conditions to A and B). Rats were fed with grower's mash and received water ad libitum. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation on the thirty-one day of the experiment and the stomach and the duodenum were immediately dissected out the epithelial cells of the stomach and the duodenum and signs of inflammation, when compared with controls. Conclusion: report involving determined digestive organs. It in gastro-ulcer patients. This DE LARGO PLAZO DEL EXTRACTO ACUOSO DE PHYLLANTHUS AMARUSSOBRE EL EST\u00d3MAGO Y EL DUODENO DE RATAS WISTAR Antecedentes: Phyllanthus amarus es un agente a base de hierbas de uso com\u00fan para el tratamiento de varias enfermedades incluyendo los trastornos g\u00e1stricos. Aun est\u00e1 pendiente un estudio sistem\u00e1tico sobre sus efectos t\u00f3xicos cuando se administran en altas dosis por largo periodo de tiempo. Objetivo: El objeto de este estudio es investigar los efectos de la administraci\u00f3n cr\u00f3nica de esta hierba sobre la histolog\u00eda del est\u00f3mago y duodeno de ratas Wistar adultas de ambos sexos. Material y m\u00e9todos: Las ratas, con un peso promedio de 200 g, se dividieron en tres grupos de ocho animales cada uno. El grupo A recibi\u00f3 P. amarus en dosis \u00fanica de 400 mg/kg de peso corporal al d\u00eda durante treinta d\u00edas mediante sonda g\u00e1strico, el grupo B recibi\u00f3 P. amarus en una sola dosis de 800mg/kg de peso corporal al d\u00eda con el mismo procedimiento y per\u00edodo, y el grupo C fue de ratas control, que recibi\u00f3 el mismo volumen de agua destilada en id\u00e9nticas condiciones que A y B. Las ratas fueron alimentadas con pienso especial para ratas y agua ad libitum. Los animales fueron sacrificados por dislocaci\u00f3n cervical en el d\u00eda treinta y uno del experimento y el est\u00f3mago y el duodeno fueron disecados e inmediatamente fijados en formol al 10% en soluci\u00f3n salina para t\u00e9cnicas histol\u00f3gicas de rutina. Resultados:En los grupos tratados, las ratas mostraron algunas distorsiones en las c\u00e9lulas epiteliales del est\u00f3mago y el duodeno y signos de inflamaci\u00f3n, en comparaci\u00f3n con los controles. Conclusi\u00f3n: Este trabajo present evidencias de que la pr\u00e1ctica etnomedicinal de administraci\u00f3n a largo plazo de Phyllanthus amarus en altas dosis tiene potencial efecto adverso histol\u00f3gico en determinados \u00f3rganos digestivos. Es probable que esta hierba puede estar contraindicada en pacientes con \u00falcera gastrointestinal. Se requieren estudios adicionales para establecer o descartar efecto secundarios en la respuesta intestinal y / o trastornos digestivos. Palabras clave: Toxicidad antioxidante. Tracto digestivo. Etnomedicina medicines are widely perceived as being free from side effects. However, herbal therapies have the herbal agents are unknown in the Western world and concerns regarding side effects in modern evidence-based medicine practice are major2. Hence, safety herbal still Phyllanthus amarus (P. an in almost all tropical countries and regions including America, India and Nigeria. It is a common weed, which grows well in moist, shady and by several names countries6-10. It is components have their useful as well as toxic effects. The toxic effects been suggested literature12-13. rats, the continuum of the is almost complete arriving to the ileum. It is known is known while is emptied from the mouth and oesophagus as quickly as it is swallowed, and small intestine is relatively slow and not consciously controlled. Yet, it is varied for different types of food. For instance, proteins are emptied slower that carbohydrates15. The implication is that any toxic content of food may have very limited time to affect the mouth and oesophagus, the potential risk on the stomach or small intestine is impacted by the relative longer time the food stays in these two regions. Therefore, the stomach and duodenum are logically the regions of the digestive tract that may be most affected by any toxic component of foods. Since P. amarus posses some potentially the of chronic administration of the herb on the microanatomy of the digestive tract by examining the stomach and duodenum. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and ethical concerns: This study is part of a project on the histological effects of P amarus research. and randomly into (n=8 two treatment groups [A] and [B] and one, untreated or control [C]. The School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin granted approval before the work began. The animal care and use ethics was in compliance to the Animal Holdings protocol overseen by the head of department through the Animal Holding unit. Rats were obtained and maintained in the Animal Holdings of the Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin, Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria. The animals were fed with grower's mash obtained from Edo Feeds and Flour Mill Limited, Edo State, Nigeria and received water ad libitum. Preparation and administration of P. amarus: The P. amarus leaves were obtained in Benin City. The leaves were cleaned, oven-dried at 50\u00b0C and macerated into evaporator suitable container and freeze dried ready for the experiment. performed at the Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria. Treatment of animals: In the main research protocol, animals in group A received the aqueous extract of P amarus at a single dose of 400mg/kg body weight daily for thirty days through the orogastric tube whilst animals of group B received a single dose of 800mg/kg body weight daily via the same route and the same period. Animals in group C received equal volume of distilled water, for the same period and through the same route of administration. Rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation on the thirty-one day of the experiment and the stomach and the duodenum were immediately dissected out photographic microscope in the Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Benin, Benin city, Edo State, Nigeria. Selection criterion: It has been speculated that toxic effects could be independent of concentration16. In earlier report on kidneys, we registered The photomicrograph of from the group showed normal histological features mucosa lined mucosa of noticed in section some varying degree the were stomach (H&E normal There were indications of the presence of Brunner's gland and other cells lining the duodenum (Fig. 2a). duodenum treated with P some distortion and disruption duodenum (H&Ex10) the rats within As explained in selection criteria, difference between groups A and B were not considered in this particular evaluation. Only the group B animals have been compared with control group C in this study. DISCUSSION Since administration of P amarus was the only differential treatment between treated and untreated groups, we guess that the registered toxic effects (Figures 1 and 2) may be attributed to the phytochemical content of P amarus. These results not only were congruent with a former report related with the toxic effects of red pepper administration on the cytoarchitecture of the stomach18, and with others found in the available literature12-13. In contrast, our findings differ from be outlined that these authors employed low doses of the plant. Considering the known health benefits of the herbal agent8-11, 20-22 also in the aforesaid toxic effects on the epithelial lining. One of the major components of P amarus of other antioxidants5, 9, has been administered in this study to apparently healthy animals. Thus, our observation is consistent with practice, patients peptic advised to the similar toxic effects produced on the cytoarchitecture of the stomach by red administration18, and the here to ethnomedicinal involving be in ulcer patients, in high dosage. it discretion with other medicines. CONCLUSION This presents histological evidence supporting that administration The hypothetical implication is that of absorption may be adversely affected by P. amarus. Last but nor the least, we hypothesize the work is part of Josiah Adjene's main research supported by the University of Benin. Some of the laboratory work for this particular report was done by Imuentinyan Abudu as part of his undergraduate study.

Argentina ] Este trabajo descriptivo histol\u00f3gico de los efectos t\u00f3xicos de Phyllanthus amarus, administrado en altas dosis, sobre est\u00f3mago y duodeno de ratas Wistar aborda un tema de inter\u00e9s ya que incursiona en la pr\u00e1ctica etnomedicinal, de innegable uso en determinados \u00e1mbitos. Sus resultados, si bien no son directamente extrapolables al ser humano y se han obtenido mediante t\u00e9cnicas histol\u00f3gicas corrientes, no resultan descartables pues sirven, por un lado, para advertir indiciariamente sobre los riesgos del uso cr\u00f3nico, indiscriminado y nada sistem\u00e1tico del P. amarus (de similares efectos a la pimienta roja en el est\u00f3mago), y, por otra parte, para alentar profundizaciones investigativas sobre este menester.
