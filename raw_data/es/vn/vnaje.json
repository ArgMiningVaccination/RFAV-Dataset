This program of work which, within the CompBiomed Centre of Excellence, we have been calling \"the CompBioMed Education and Training Programme,\" is a holistic endeavor that has been developed by and continues to be delivered with the expertise and support from experimental researchers, computer scientists, clinicians, HPC centers, and industrial partners within or associated with CompBioMed. The original description of the initial educational approach to training has previously been published (Townsend-Nicholson Interface Focus 10:20200003, 2020). In this chapter, I describe the refinements to the program and its delivery, emphasizing the highs and lows of delivering this program over the past 6 years.

Primary Health Care (PHC), defined from the Declaration of Alma-Ata, and identified worldwide as a strategy for organizing health services, is characterized as the first level of contact of individuals, family and community with the national health system. This paper is an experience report developed from a theoretical-practical activity, which proposed to analyze the attributes and work processes of Primary Health Care in the context of a Family Health Unit (USF) in the municipality of Foz do Igua\u00e7u-PR, with the objective of relating theory to practice, through questionnaires, prepared based on the literature and applied to professionals and users of the health system. In addition, there was observation of the routine of the work process in the unit. The experience made it possible to identify the challenges and weaknesses related to the attributes of PHC and the constituent elements of the health work process. Finally, it is concluded that, in the daily life of services, PHC faces many difficulties in establishing itself as predicted in the literature and, social participation is necessary for its effectiveness and consecration as the first level of contact with the health system.

RESUMEN Medical students in the Netherlands have a relatively low exposure to cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology. This results discrepancies between starting levels of medical residents and expected standards in clinical practice. Another side effect is the international decline in interest in a career in these cardiovascular fields. To compensate for this, extracurricular education programs focused on cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology have set up. This study aims to evaluate the impact and benefits of the program VECTOR and were included in a cross-sectional cohort study. All participants scored of cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology prior = < .001). Significant increased knowledge scores were reported for all an increase in academic in cardiology (p = < .001) and cardiothoracic (p = < .001). Students revealed most when deciding upon their future career. This study highlights the benefit of an extracurricular education program in cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology for preparing for clinical practice.

CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a significant presence of the medical humanities in UME, there is a need for integration of the arts and humanities into required UME curricula and into the years, and it is possible that, in addition to social factors, they are influenced by the characteristics of a person's personality and the sense of belonging to the social environment.

While prior research has explored the influence of anti-Asian racism on the experiences of Asian American health care workers, to our knowledge there are no studies investigating how racism has impacted the Objective: American medical students have experienced anti-Asian racism in a medical school learning environment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study included online Asian American medical students performed between July and 22, 2022. Eligible participants were recruited through the Asian Pacific American Medical Students Association and snowball sampling, and the sample represented a disaggregated population of Asian Americans and all 4 medical school years. Main Outcomes and Measures: The medical school experiences Among 25 participants, Asian ethnicities included 8 Chinese American (32%), 5 Korean American (20%), 5 Indian American (20%), 3 Vietnamese American (12%), 2 Filipino American (8%), and 1 (4%) each Nepalese, Pakistani, and Desi American; major themes as racial aggression (eg, \"It took them the whole first year to be able to tell me apart from the other Asian guy\"); (2) visibility and racial aggression (\"It felt to actual aggression\"); (3) absence of the Asian American experience in medical school (\"They're not going to mention Asian Americans at all\"); (4) while seeking support (\"I don't know what it means to have this part of my identity supported\"); and (5) envisioning the future. Conclusions and this qualitative study, Asian American medical students reported feeling invisible within medical school while a target racism. [BMC Med 649, 2023 Sep 08. RESUMEN OBJECTIVE: The motivation for this study stemmed from the growing beliefs the study aimed to identify gaps in their training and areas where improvements can be made to better equip them for this critical aspect of healthcare. METHOD: This study was a qualitative thematic analysis. The participants of this research were selected from among the general medicine internship students of Iran University of Medical Sciences by purposive method. In-depth individual thematic analysis. Using this approach, the analysis of the data became more adaptable and open-ended, free from the restrictions of pre-existing theoretical was used to qualitative A total of 27 interviewed semi-structured, and audio files were transcribed immediately the process reading interviews carefully were and these codes were divided into five main categories under the title of root factors after constant comparison analysis. Five main themes are including discrimination in service a lack of inter-professional training, interpersonal communication skills, care through the attitudes and perceptions of medical students toward older adult care in a country. The findings reveal that there are significant gaps in their training preparation for providing quality to this as root factors highlight key areas where improvements can be made in medical education. It is recommended that medical schools in low and middle-income countries consider incorporating these themes into their curricula equip future healthcare professionals with the necessary skills RESUMEN OBJECTIVE: investigate critical thinking disposition of medical This cross-sectional study on 426 students from four majors, including preventive medicine, maternal and children's health care medicine, health inspection and quarantine, and food quality and safety. The survey was completed in May 2019 using the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory-Chinese version (CTDI-CV).

There is currently a lack of data looking at whether item variants to a single question result in student performance or human-derived standard setting. The purpose of this study was to use 50 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) as models to create four distinct tests which would be standard set and given to final year UK medical students, and then to compare the performance and standard setting data for each. METHODS: Pre-existing questions from the same question template with minor alterations to test the same learning outcome. All UK medical schools were invited to deliver one of the four papers as an online formative assessment for their final year students. Each using analysis and low levels of variance in facility (for student performance) and average scores (for standard setting). RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred eighteen students from 12 UK medical schools participated, with each school using one of the four papers. The average facility of the four papers ranged from 0.55-0.61, and the cut score ranged from 0.58-0.61. Twenty item models had a facility difference > 0.15 and 10 item models had a difference in standard setting of > 0.1. Variation in parameters that could alter This difference may confounded by the possibility that the performance differences may be explained at current UK medical students' career intentions after graduation and on completing the Foundation the motivations behind these sampling method. SETTING: All 44 UK medical schools recognised by the General Medical Council. PARTICIPANTS: All UK medical students were eligible to participate. sample consisted of correlating demographic propensity to leave of participating students (8806/10 486, 83.98%) to complete both years of the FP after graduation, with under half of these students intentions after FP by of study revealed a significant decrease in students' intentions to enter specialty training as they advanced through medical school.
