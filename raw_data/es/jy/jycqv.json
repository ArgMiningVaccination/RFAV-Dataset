Background: Scimitar syndrome is a rare and complex congenital anomaly of the lung with multiple variables and is named for its resemblance to the classical radiological crooked sword. Its defining feature is the It is associated cardiothoracic spectrum patients diagnosed with scimitar syndrome found in the database of Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed. Demographic records, clinical status and hemodynamic series to certain differences between our group of patients and those reported in the international literature. Patients were predominantly female and were diagnosed between 1 and 20 months of life. All were asymptomatic at the time of the study. Half of the patients had a history of respiratory disease and all patients with pulmonary Introduction Scimitar syndrome is characterized by an abnormal connection or more pulmonary veins and the systemic venous system. usually drains into the hepatic portion of the inferior cava, but can also flow the suprahepatic vein, portal left to right The word derivation which or Oriental refers to the curvilinear that the anomalous vein projects in the cavity (image corresponding to a female patient 17 years of age). However, in some cases the scimitar sign may be absent, especially in cases with marked hypertrophy of the right atrium or in those associated with dextrocardia and hypoplasia of the right lung. This causes displacement of the mediastinum to the right and to elevation of the diaphragmatic dome (Fig. 2).2,3 Figure 2 Chest tomography. Window for contrasted mediastinum: coronal cut (A) and axial cut (B). Dextrocardia and right lung hypoplasia is observed giving rise of the and mild elevation of the ipsilateral diaphragmatic dome. At the side of the cardiac silhouette age). The scimitar sign is the 2% of congenital heart diseases1 and 3 to 5% of the cases of anomalous return of the pulmonary veins. An incidence of 1/3 cases per 100,000 live newborns has been described.6 Although the pathogenesis is unclear, associated lung malformations seem to suggest an alteration of the development of the pulmonary bud in the early stages of embryogenesis. The reason for its preferential location in the right lung is not known.2 It is frequently associated with hypoplastic right pulmonary be present2 as well with anomalous arterial irrigation of the aorta or one its to an interatrial communication in 60 to 70% of cases and other congenital heart diseases in19 to 31%.8 The age at the time of the diagnosis is variable. It can be classified as infantile (<1 year of age) or adult (>1 year of age). Occasionally, a third group is classified characterized by the association with complex congenital anomalies that modify the symptoms and the natural history of the syndrome.6,9 The infantile variant has a worse have even been reported to be associated with bronchiectasis.1,2,6,8 In the adult group with a favorable prognosis, the diagnosis is often The association with defects presents itself with a 36% frequency in adults and up to 75% in children. The clinical picture depends on the severity of the right to right shunt, heart diseases and the magnitude of the pulmonary hypertension.6 The association with the latter two increases the risk of congestive heart failure and death.8 In less than 50% of in the patient's progress. It may be linked with high resistances in the pulmonary vascular bed (in which the circulation does not adapt itself after birth) and an important short circuit between abnormal arteries originating in the abdominal aorta, which irrigate the inferior portion of the right lung.8 is caused by stenosis of the anomalous pulmonary vein (most common), reduction of the right pulmonary vascular bed or increase of pulmonary blood flow due to the vascular 4); and adequate 2. well reported and Doppler can evaluate pulmonary cardiac is when clinical symptoms persist or worsen or if there elevation artery pressure on indirect determination recommended as prognosis of the associated heart defects may provide a benign evolution comparable with those of the primary isolated forms.8,10 Association with right syndrome causes considerable pulmonary overload.8 2. Case series The Hospital Infantil de M\u00e9xico Federico G\u00f3mez (HIMFG) database for the last 5 years was reviewed. of nine patients had been evaluated during the period from 2009-2013 were found (Table 1). The group had eight female patients with ages between the first month of life and 14 years of age (median of 6 months) at the time of the diagnosis and age from 3 to 18 years (median 9 years) at the time of the study. The nine patients were reported to be asymptomatic at the time of the last entry on the record. Five patients had patients had an echocardiogram performed. Also, in the last medical note, all were reported to have pulmonary hypertension (with right ventricular systolic pressure of 38 to 95 mmHg). Two patients ventricular dilatation performed. was reported the group (eight patients), hypoplasia of the right of vicariant circulation of the descending aorta to scoliosis (one patient), and imperforate anus (one patient). At time of the study, two patients were managed expectantly and the (diuretic and/or vasodilator). supplemental oxygen during their last physician visit, and two had catheterization (of the with this procedure). Among the not by fetal echocardiogram or with magnetic resonance. 3. Discussion In the present series of cases seen at the HIMFG, there were differences and similarities observed with what has been reported in the international literature. The group studied was predominantly female with a ratio of 8:1, which differs from what is reported in the literature (1.4:16) and could be attributed to the reduced size of the group. The average age for the diagnosis reported in the literature is from 7 months.6 Age at the time of diagnosis in these patients had a median of 6 months and was as early as the first day of life and as late as a case diagnosed at the age of 14 years. Therefore, at the time of the diagnosis ages of presentation were shared both in the infantile group (66.6%) as well as the adult group (33.3%). Although the literature reports that almost half of the patients were asymptomatic,6 the totality of the group was reported to be asymptomatic at the last medical evaluation. There were no deaths reported, even though study is affiliated with a third-level hospital, it is impossible to assure that the reason for not finding symptomatic was of presentation before referred to this type of hospital. Asthma and hemoptysis were reported within the history of respiratory compromise; the former has not been reported as part of the natural evolution of the disease and the latter has been associated with pulmonary hypertension more than with in for each group). There were no patients reported with heart failure. The difference in the number of patients with pulmonary hypertension and the absence of heart failure can be associated with congenital heart disease and the size of the sample. In this group, the association with tracheobronchial disorders, absence an imperforate anus was reported, a condition which is not routinely reported in the literature to be associated with scimitar syndrome. The patient was also documented with a superior double vena cava and scoliosis (Figs. 1 and 4). The remainder of the associations in our patients coincides with what has been reported.
