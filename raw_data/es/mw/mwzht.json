Resumen1 1En el resumen no se han incluido referencias. Resumen ~ 3 ~ 1. Introducci\u00f3n El sector del envasado representa uno de los principales sectores en la industria del pl\u00e1stico a nivel mundial y ha experimentado en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os un continuo crecimiento debido a la diversidad de productos y aplicaciones que comprende. Los pl\u00e1sticos utilizados en envasado alimentario deben contribuir al mantenimiento de la calidad y seguridad de los alimentos desde su procesado hasta su consumo, incluyendo en este ciclo el almacenamiento y el transporte. Para ello, los envases alimentarios deben proporcionar protecci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica, \u00f3ptica y t\u00e9rmica a los alimentos envasados, a dem\u00e1s de preservarlos contra factores o condiciones de degradaci\u00f3n, tales como microorganismos, ox\u00edgeno, humedad, contaminantes qu\u00edmicos, radiaci\u00f3n y elevadas temperaturas. Los pol\u00edmeros convencionales han sido tradicionalmente muy utilizados en este secto r, en especial los pol\u00edmeros termopl\u00e1sticos derivados del petr\u00f3leo cuya introducci\u00f3n se produjo en las d\u00e9cadas de 1950 y 1960. Su uso se extendi\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente debido a su gran versatilidad que comprende un amplio abanico de propiedades que los hace adecuado s para aplicaciones espec\u00edficas en el \u00e1mbito de la alimentaci\u00f3n. Entre dichas propiedades cabe destacar su alta disponibilidad a un coste relativamente bajo y su buen comportamiento f\u00edsico -qu\u00edmico en condiciones de tracci\u00f3n y resistencia al desgarro ; adem\u00e1 s de la buena barrera al ox\u00edgeno, vapor de agua, CO 2 y aromas que ofrecen, as\u00ed como la buena capacidad de procesamiento. Sin embargo , estos pol\u00edmeros presentan el doble inconveniente de su origen no renovable y su baja capacidad de degradaci\u00f3n en condicion es naturales, por lo que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os son cada vez m\u00e1s las voces que abogan por el uso de biopol\u00edmeros en sistemas de envasado, materiales Resumen ~ 4 ~ que se caracterizan por su biodegradabilidad y su origen a partir de fuentes renovables. Su desarrollo en las dos \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas los hace merecedores de ser considerados una alternativa v\u00e1lida para reducir significativamente el impacto medioambiental de los pl\u00e1sticos convencionales, considerando la problem\u00e1tica relacionada con su eliminaci\u00f3n, aliviando, a su vez, la dependencia del petr\u00f3leo y otras fuentes no renovables. El uso de estos biopol\u00edmeros, como pueden ser el poli(\u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico) (PLA) o el almid\u00f3n termopl\u00e1stico (TPS), est\u00e1 cada vez m\u00e1s introduci\u00e9ndose en el cada vez m\u00e1s competitivo mercado del envase ali mentario. Por otra parte, la idea de mejorar la calidad y ampliar la vida \u00fatil de los alimentos, mientras se mantienen sus propiedades organol\u00e9pticas y nutritivas , est\u00e1 generando un importante inter\u00e9s en el entorno cient\u00edfico y de la industria alimentaria. De hecho, el concepto tradicional de envase alimentario que basa su funci\u00f3n en contener y preservar al alimento sin que se produzca ninguna interacci\u00f3n entre \u00e9ste y el material de envase, ha evolucionado con el fin de permitir interacciones entre ellos, a s\u00ed como con el medioambiente. Este nuevo concepto es el de envase activo, y se basa en favorecer el proceso de transferencia de masa e interacci\u00f3n entre los materiales de envase y los alimentos. El objetivo principal de los sistemas de envasado activo es a largar la vida \u00fatil de los productos envasados, minimizando o suprimiendo los efectos negativos producidos por agentes del entorno que producen los procesos de descomposici\u00f3n del alimento. Entre dichos procesos destacan la presencia de microorganismos y la s oxidaciones de l\u00edpidos, que causan p\u00e9rdidas inaceptables en la calidad del alimento, haci\u00e9ndolo inviable para su consumo en un corto tiempo. El creciente inter\u00e9s por este tipo de envases y la demanda de los consumidores en lo que se refiere a productos n aturales, seguros, frescos y de larga vida \u00fatil ha incrementado el estudio del uso de aditivos de origen Resumen ~ 5 ~ natural, como extractos de plantas y aceites esenciales, en sistemas de envasado. Estos productos se clasifican como \" Generally Recognized as Safe\" (GRAS) por la \"Food and Drug Administration\" (FDA) de Estados Unidos, as\u00ed como por la Legislaci\u00f3n Europea actual para materiales destinados a estar en contacto con alimentos. Los aditivos naturales pueden ser obtenidos de diferentes fuentes, incluyendo planta s, animales, bacterias, algas u hongos, adem\u00e1s de subproductos generados en la industria alimentaria como pueden ser, por ejemplo, la c\u00e1scara de la almendra, deshechos de salvia o de cascara de naranja. Los aceites esenciales y sus principales compuestos constituyentes son algunos de los agentes activos m\u00e1s estudiados para ser incorporados como aditivos activos en formulaciones polim\u00e9ricas , sean estos de origen natural o sint\u00e9tico, ya que son aditivos nat urales que provienen de fuentes renovables, son f\u00e1ciles de obtener y presentan un elevado car\u00e1cter antimicrobiano y/o antioxidante. Entre ellos , destacan el -isopropil -5-metilfenol, dos monoterpenos fen\u00f3licos que se caracterizan por ser dos de los aditivos naturales m\u00e1s estudiados debido a sus excelentes propiedades antioxidantes y antimicrobianas, descritas ampliamente en la literatura cient\u00edfica. Estas propiedades, que les confieren un amplio abanico de posib ilidades en el \u00e1rea de los materiales para envasado activo, se deben a la presencia de grupos hidroxilo, altamente reactivos, en su estructura. Ambos compuestos son is\u00f3meros obtenidos a partir de diferentes plantas arom\u00e1ticas y aceites esenciales de la fam ilia de las Labiatae , Thymus y Corydothymus . Por otra parte, la aplicaci\u00f3n de los conceptos b\u00e1sicos de la nanotecnolog\u00eda a la ciencia de materiales ha constituido una revoluci\u00f3n en los paradigmas Resumen ~ 6 ~ de dich a ciencia, ya que se han desarrollado nuevos nanomateriales con resultados novedosos y sorprendentes. En el \u00e1rea del envasado de alimentos estos nanomateriales han supuesto un cambio considerable debido a las nuevas propiedades y funciones que aportan, que han hecho que el uso de nanocargas haya ganado importancia como aditivos en materiales de envasado. Investigaciones recientes centradas en el uso de nanopart\u00edculas han permitido crear, entender, caracterizar y usar estos nanocompuestos debido a su acci\u00f3n en la mejora de algunas de sus propiedades clave tales como la resistencia mec\u00e1nica, propiedades de barrera a gases o estabilidad t\u00e9rmica. Asimismo, un aspecto de alta relevancia para este trabajo es que la adici\u00f3n de nanopart\u00edculas con propiedades antimic robianas y/o antioxidantes resulta en una combinaci\u00f3n excelente con los aditivos activos para conseguir la m\u00e1xima protecci\u00f3n en los alimentos envasados. El uso de nanomateriales en combinaci\u00f3n con sistemas de envasado activo ha permitido mejorar la integri dad estructural y las propiedades de barrera de las matrices polim\u00e9ricas debido a la adici\u00f3n de los nanomateriales (ya sea nanoarcillas o nanopart\u00edculas met\u00e1licas), as\u00ed como la mejora en el comportamiento antimicrobiano y/o antioxidante por la acci\u00f3n de lo s aditivos activos, como los aceites esenciales de or\u00e9gano o clavo o bien compuestos con actividad intr\u00ednseca como el timol, carvacrol, tocoferoles o hidroxitirosol. Las nanopart\u00edculas de cobre, zinc, titanio, oro y plata, as\u00ed como algunos de sus \u00f3xidos me t\u00e1licos, tambi\u00e9n han sido propuestas como aditivos activos con el fin de extender la vida \u00fatil de los alimentos y proporcionar estrategias innovadoras, aceptables y seguras para desarrollar nuevos nanocompuestos activos. Una vez desarrollado el nanocompues to activo su efecto sobre el alimento debe ser evaluado ya que depender\u00e1 de la actividad de cada aditivo y de Resumen ~ 7 ~ sus propiedades, as\u00ed como del tipo de alimento considerado, su composici\u00f3n y contenidos en grasa y agua. Se ha indicado que los alimentos lip\u00eddico s tienden a oxidarse m\u00e1s f\u00e1cilmente que los acuosos, as\u00ed como que los alimentos procesados pueden tener una mayor tendencia a sufrir una contaminaci\u00f3n cruzada que conlleve al deterioro del producto. En este sentido, el pol\u00edmero desempe\u00f1a el papel m\u00e1s impor tante en la acci\u00f3n de liberaci\u00f3n de los aditivos mediante el control de la difusi\u00f3n de los componentes activos en el seno de la matriz polim\u00e9rica y la distribuci\u00f3n homog\u00e9nea de las nanocargas en su estructura. La aplicaci\u00f3n de los sistemas de envasado acti vo, en especial aquellos que comprenden el uso de nanocompuestos, debe ser evaluada de forma que se pueda determinar de forma inequ\u00edvoca la seguridad para el consumidor de estos materiales en contacto con alimentos, siempre considerando las normativas inte rnacionales que limitan, proh\u00edben y/o autorizan el uso de este tipo de aditivos. En la actualidad , se est\u00e1n desarrollado un n\u00famero elevado de investigaciones para evaluar la posibilidad de desarrollo y utilizaci\u00f3n de nanocompuestos con propiedades activas mediante la combinaci\u00f3n de diferentes tipos de nanocargas (nanoarcillas, nanocelulosas, nanopart\u00edculas de plata, etc.) con aditivos de origen natural con propiedades antimicrobianas y/o antioxidantes en matrices polim\u00e9ricas. Los principales esfuerzos en el desarrollo de estos materiales se han centrado en estudiar sus propiedades funcionales mediante el uso de m\u00e9todos de determinaci\u00f3n del comportamiento antimicrobiano y antioxidante, estudios de desintegraci\u00f3n, toxicol\u00f3gicos y de migraci\u00f3n. Resumen ~ 8 ~ 2. Objetivos El objetivo general de este trabajo es el desarrollo de nuevos sistemas activos de envasado con capacidad de protecci\u00f3n de las caracter\u00edsticas organol\u00e9pticas y nutricionales de los alimentos y prolongada vida \u00fatil. Para ello, en el presente trabajo se han de sarrollo dos l\u00edneas b\u00e1sicas de investigaci\u00f3n: (1) sistemas de envasado activo utilizando polipropileno (PP) como pol\u00edmero base en combinaci\u00f3n con timol y/o carvacrol; y (2) nanocompuestos activos utilizando PLA como matriz biodegradable en combinaci\u00f3n con timol y dos tipos de nano -refuerzos comerciales, una nanoarcilla (Dellite\u00ae43B, D43B) y nanopart\u00edculas de plata (Ag -NPs). Para satisfacer el objetivo principal del presente trabajo se han planteado una serie de objetivos espec\u00edficos que se enumeran a contin uaci\u00f3n: i. Desarrollo y caracterizaci\u00f3n de pel\u00edculas basadas en PP con carvacrol y timol. Se han estudiado diferentes propiedades f\u00edsico - qu\u00edmicas de las pel\u00edculas activas obtenidas (morfolog\u00eda, comportamiento mec\u00e1nico, propiedades t\u00e9rmicas y propiedades de barrera). La actividad antimicrobiana proporcionada por los aditivos a estos sistemas de envasado fue evaluada frente a una bacteria Gram positiva (Staphylococcus aureus y otra Gram negativa (Escherichia coli) . Tambi\u00e9n se estudi\u00f3 la liberaci\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol desde la matriz polim\u00e9rica hacia distintos simulantes alimentarios; incluyendo un estudio cin\u00e9tico para modelar el comportamiento de migraci\u00f3n de estos dos compuestos en diversos medios. Tambi\u00e9n se ha evaluado la actividad antioxidante de los extractos obt enidos. Por \u00faltimo, la eficiencia de las nuevas pel\u00edculas activas fue evaluada estudiando el aumento de la vida \u00fatil de dos muestras de alimentos (fresas y pan de molde) almacenados en diferentes condiciones. Resumen ~ 9 ~ ii. Desarrollo y caracterizaci\u00f3n de nanocompuestos activos en una matriz de PLA y usando timol como aditivo activo. En este punto, dos formulaciones diferentes fueron propuestas. a. Nanocompuestos activos en base PLA con timol y una nanoarcilla comercial org\u00e1nicamente modificada (Dellite\u00ae43B, D43B). La caract erizaci\u00f3n de estos nanocompuestos se llev\u00f3 a cabo estudiando sus propiedades morfol\u00f3gicas, mec\u00e1nicas, t\u00e9rmicas, \u00f3pticas y de barrera a gases. Tambi\u00e9n se llev\u00f3 a cabo la evaluaci\u00f3n de la velocidad de desintegraci\u00f3n en condiciones de compostaje, as\u00ed como el estudio de la liberaci\u00f3n de los compuestos activos en condiciones controladas utilizando un simulante alimentario acuoso y la actividad antimicrobiana y antioxidante de las nuevas pel\u00edculas activas. b. Nanocompuestos activos utilizando PLA, timol y nanopart\u00edc ulas de plata, procesando dos tipos de morfolog\u00edas: pel\u00edculas y probetas. Se llev\u00f3 a cabo una caracterizaci\u00f3n completa de las nuevas formulaciones, en lo referente a sus propiedades morfol\u00f3gicas, mec\u00e1nicas, t\u00e9rmicas, \u00f3pticas y de barrera a ox\u00edgeno y vapor de agua. La desintegraci\u00f3n de estos nanocompuestos fue evaluada en condiciones de compostaje. Se llevaron a cabo estudios de liberaci\u00f3n en un simulante alimentario acuoso. Por \u00faltimo , se estudi\u00f3 la actividad antioxidante y la actividad antimicrobiana de es tos nanocompuestos activos. Resumen ~ 10 ~ 3. Resultados y discusi\u00f3n 3.1. Cap\u00edtulo 1 El timol y el carvacrol han sido seleccionados para ser adicionados a las nuevas formulaciones activas en base PP debido a sus caracter\u00edsticas antimicrobianas y antioxidantes y su origen natura l. Un total de nueve formulaciones activas se han obtenido con 4, 6 y 8 % en peso de timol y/o carvacrol, que fueron utilizadas para obtener las diferentes pel\u00edculas activas. Una vez obtenidas las pel\u00edculas mediante mezclado en fundido seguido de moldeo po r compresi\u00f3n se caracterizaron evaluando sus propiedades t\u00e9rmicas, morfol\u00f3gicas, mec\u00e1nicas y funcionales. Los resultados obtenidos en este cap\u00edtulo mostraron que la presencia de los aditivos no afect\u00f3 a la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica de la matriz de PP, pero s\u00ed que produjo una disminuci\u00f3n significativa de la cristalinidad del material debido a las interacciones entre la matriz polim\u00e9rica y los aditivos. Esta disminuci\u00f3n en la estructura cristalina del material tiene una importante influencia sobre los ensayos de tr acci\u00f3n, donde se observ\u00f3 un significativo descenso en el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico y por tanto en la rigidez del material. Estos resultados adem\u00e1s indicaron que la presencia de timol y carvacrol tuvieron un ligero efecto plastificante sobre la matriz polim\u00e9rica. Las im\u00e1genes obtenidas de estos materiales mediante microscop\u00eda electr\u00f3nica de barrido (SEM) mostraron superficies homog\u00e9neas en todas las pel\u00edculas, pero una cierta porosidad supericial en las de mayor concentraci\u00f3n de aditivos debido probablemente a una eva poraci\u00f3n parcial del timol y/o carvacrol durante el procesado, aunque en los estudios mediante an\u00e1lisis termogravim\u00e9trico (TGA) se comprob\u00f3 que una fracci\u00f3n importante de dichos aditivos permaneci\u00f3 en la matriz tras el procesado. Resumen ~ 11 ~ Los resultados obtenidos p ara los par\u00e1metros de inducci\u00f3n a la oxidaci\u00f3n demostraron que la adici\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol favoreci\u00f3 el incremento de la estabilidad ante la oxidaci\u00f3n a temperaturas altas, demostrando con ello la actividad antioxidante de ambos aditivos. Adem\u00e1s, el es tudio antimicrobiano demostr\u00f3 que las formulaciones a concentraciones elevadas de timol (8 % en peso) presentaron una mayor actividad antimicrobiana. Se evalu\u00f3 la capacidad de liberaci\u00f3n de las nuevas pel\u00edculas mediante estudios de migraci\u00f3n. Para ello , se seleccionaron las formulaciones con mayor concentraci\u00f3n de aditivo (8 % en peso) y la migraci\u00f3n de carvacrol y timol se determin\u00f3 utilizando procedimientos anal\u00edticos r\u00e1pidos y fiables, desarrollados y validados en este mismo trabajo, para la determinaci\u00f3 n de los extractos obtenidos en diferentes simulantes alimentarios: agua destilada (A), \u00e1cido ac\u00e9tico 3 % (p/v) (B), y etanol 10 % (v/v) (C) como simulantes acuosos y etanol 95 % (v/v) e iso -octano como simulantes grasos. Para los extractos obtenidos a par tir de los simulantes acuosos se llev\u00f3 a cabo un proceso de extracci\u00f3n en fase s\u00f3lida (SPE) del timol y carvacrol migrado seguido de determinaci\u00f3n mediante cromatograf\u00eda de gases acoplada a espectrometr\u00eda de masas (GC/MS). En el caso de los extractos de mi graci\u00f3n obtenidos a partir de los simulantes grasos ambos compuestos fueron analizados directamente mediante GC/MS y tambi\u00e9n usando cromatograf\u00eda de l\u00edquidos de alta resoluci\u00f3n con detecci\u00f3n por espectrofotometr\u00eda ultravioleta -visible (HPLC -UV) para iso -octano y etanol 95 % (v/v) , respectivamente. Los resultados obtenidos en estos ensayos demostraron que la liberaci\u00f3n de timol y/o carvacrol desde la matriz polim\u00e9rica era dependiente del tipo de aditivo y del simulante alimentario utilizado. En concreto, los niveles m\u00e1s elevados de migraci\u00f3n se obtuvieron para ambos aditivos en iso - Resumen ~ 12 ~ octano, mostrando el timol una migraci\u00f3n superior a 1000 mg por kg de simulante. La cin\u00e9tica de liberaci\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol en las pel\u00edculas obtenidas siguieron un comportamien to de acuerdo con las leyes de Fick para la difusi\u00f3n de componentes de bajo peso molecular en matrices polim\u00e9ricas, con unos valores del coeficiente de difusi\u00f3n que oscilaron entre 1 hasta 2 x 10-14 m2 s-1; aunque la difusi\u00f3n en iso -octano fue entre 4 y 6 veces superior a estos valores. La actividad antioxidante de los extractos de migraci\u00f3n fue confirmada por el m\u00e9todo de formaci\u00f3n del complejo coloreado DPPH (1,1 -difenil -2- picril -hidrazilo), demostrando que el timol posee una mayor actividad antioxidante especialmente en iso -octano con un 42,2 % de inhibici\u00f3n. Por \u00faltimo , se estudi\u00f3 la liberaci\u00f3n de timol y carvacrol en dos alimentos reales utilizando la micro -extracci\u00f3n en fase s\u00f3lida para evaluar la cantidad de timol o carvacrol liberados en el espacio de cabeza. Se llev\u00f3 a cabo una evaluaci\u00f3n visual que permiti\u00f3 comprob ar que la degradaci\u00f3n organol\u00e9ptica de las fresas y el pan de molde se retras \u00f3, permitiendo un aumento en la vida \u00fatil de varios d\u00edas en ambos alimentos. Tambi\u00e9n se identific\u00f3 la presencia de sustancias liberadas relacionadas con la degradaci\u00f3n de los alim entos y se observ\u00f3 la aparici\u00f3n de estas sustancias a tiempos m\u00e1s largos en los sistemas de envasado activo. 3.2. Capitulo 2 En la primera parte de este cap\u00edtulo se utiliz\u00f3 el PLA como matriz biopolim\u00e9rica, y D43B como nanoarcilla con el fin de obtener nuevas formulaciones activas con timol. Uno de los objetivos que se persiguieron con la incorporaci\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla era mejorar las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas del nanocompuesto, debido a su dispersi\u00f3n entre las cadenas Resumen ~ 13 ~ polim\u00e9ricas y por tanto al efecto de refuerzo que proporciona a la matriz debido a su estructura laminar. Se comprob\u00f3 que la incorporaci\u00f3n de D43B condujo a un aumento en el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico y una disminuci\u00f3n de la elongaci\u00f3n a ruptura. En cambio , la adici\u00f3n de timol provoc\u00f3 un descenso alrededor del 15 % en los valores del m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico respecto a los del PLA puro. Estos resultados son concordantes con el ligero efecto plastificante observado mediante calorimetr\u00eda diferencial de barrido (DSC) en los nanocompuestos activos, con una disminuci\u00f3n en la temperatra de transici\u00f3n v\u00edtrea ( Tg) de aproximadamente 13 \u00b0C para las formulaciones con timol. Sin embargo, los resultados obtenidos mediante TGA demostraron que la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica del PLA no se vio afectada significativamente por la adici\u00f3n de timol ni por la presencia de la nanoarcilla. El an\u00e1lisis estructural de estos nanocompuestos activos demostr\u00f3 la intercalaci\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla laminar entre las cadenas polim\u00e9ricas, ya que en los espectros de difracci\u00f3n por rayos X ( XRD ) se observ\u00f3 un desplaza miento del pico caracter\u00edstico de difracci\u00f3n desde 19,2 \u00c5 para la nanoarcilla pura hasta 35,6 \u00c5 para los nanocompuestos. Asimismo, las im\u00e1genes obtenidas mediante microscop\u00eda electr\u00f3nica de transmisi\u00f3n (TEM) mostraron una dispersi\u00f3n parcial, e incluso en a lgunas zonas se pudo apreciar cierta exfoliaci\u00f3n de las l\u00e1minas de nanoarcilla en el seno de la matriz polim\u00e9rica. La cantidad remanente de timol determinada en estas formulaciones tras el procesado mediante HPLC -UV fue 5,57 \u00b1 0,01 % en peso para la formul aci\u00f3n con 8 % en peso de timol, y 5,99 \u00b1 0,03 % en peso y 5,78 \u00b1 0,02 % en peso para las formulaciones con timol y 2,5 y 5 % en peso de D43B , respectivamente. De este modo , queda demostrada la presencia de timol tras el procesado, as\u00ed como un efecto de pro tecci\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla Resumen ~ 14 ~ sobre el timol cuando ambos se encuentran dispersos en la matriz polim\u00e9rica impidiendo su p\u00e9rdida durante el procesado. A la hora de evaluar el car\u00e1cter biodegradable de los nanocompuestos desarrollados en este cap\u00edtulo se llev\u00f3 a cabo un estudio de desintegraci\u00f3n bajo condiciones de compostaje y seg\u00fan la normativa vigente para este tipo de ensayos. Los resultados mostraron que \u00fanicamente son necesarios 35 d\u00edas para lograr un porcentaje de desintegraci\u00f3n superior al 90 %, cumpliend o de esta forma los requerimientos impuestos por la legislaci\u00f3n. El proceso de degradaci\u00f3n de estos materiales es debido en gran medida a la degradaci\u00f3n hidrol\u00edtica de sus cadenas polim\u00e9ricas, vi\u00e9ndose favorecido el proceso por la presencia de timol debido a los grupos hidroxilo libres en la estructura del nanocompuesto. Las muestras sometidas a estos ensayos fueron tambi\u00e9n caracterizadas mediante espectroscopia infrarroja por transformada de Fourier (FTIR) y DSC. Se pudo demostrar una relaci\u00f3n directa entr e los cambios visuales con la progresiva degradaci\u00f3n de las formulaciones estudiadas ya que se observ\u00f3 un claro descenso en la intensidad de pico relacionada con el grupo carbonilo ( -C=O) de la lactida a 1750 cm-1 y una simultanea aparici\u00f3n de un pico cara cter\u00edstico de los carbonilos, a causa del grupo \u00e1cido carbox\u00edlico formado por la ruptura hidrol\u00edtica de los \u00e9 steres. Asimismo , se observ\u00f3 un descenso del valor de Tg y la aparici\u00f3n de picos endot\u00e9rmicos de fusi\u00f3n debidos al proceso de degradaci\u00f3n relaciona do con la cristalinidad. La aplicabilidad de estos nanocompuestos en base PLA a sistemas de envasado activo se evalu\u00f3 mediante un estudio de liberaci\u00f3n utilizando como simulante alimentario etanol 10 % (v/v). El estudio de migraci\u00f3n mostr\u00f3 una liberaci\u00f3n c ontrolada de timol con el tiempo a trav\u00e9s de la matriz polim\u00e9rica hasta alcanzar el simulante alimentario. Estos resultados sugirieron que era posible controlar la liberaci\u00f3n de timol en el sistema Resumen ~ 15 ~ activo mediante la incorporaci\u00f3n de D43B, ya que un aument o en la dispersi\u00f3n de la nanoarcilla se tradujo en una disminuci\u00f3n de la velocidad del proceso y del coeficiente de difusi\u00f3n. La actividad antioxidante de estos nanocompuestos se evalu\u00f3 en los extractos obtenidos antes y despu\u00e9s de los ensayos de migraci\u00f3n . El porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n confirm\u00f3 que la cantidad de timol presente al inicio y tras el estudio de migraci\u00f3n era suficiente para alcanzar una inhibici\u00f3n de la oxidaci\u00f3n superior al 70 % confirmando de este modo la capacidad antioxidante de las nuevas formulaciones. La actividad antimicrobiana de estas formulaciones fue evaluada utilizando dos tipos de bacterias caracter\u00edsticas de los alimentos, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positiva) y Escherichia coli (Gram negativa). El ensayo se llev\u00f3 a cabo en condic iones aerobias colocando las pel\u00edculas en contacto con una disoluci\u00f3n de una concentraci\u00f3n determinada de inoculo durante un tiempo de incubaci\u00f3n de 3 y 24 horas a 4, 24 y 37 \u00b0C. Los resultados mostraron que las formulaciones con timol y D43B presentaron una capacidad de inhibici\u00f3n a diferentes tiempos y temperaturas superior a las formulaciones que incorporan los aditivos por separado. De este modo, se confirm\u00f3 lo descrito en la bibliograf\u00eda referente al timol y su poder antimicrobiano frente a diferentes bacterias y hongos; y a las nanoarcillas, a las cuales se les atribuye un cierto poder antimicrobiano por el modificador org\u00e1nico que las forma. La segunda parte del Cap\u00edtulo 2 se centr\u00f3 en el desarrollo de nuevos nanocompuestos activos basados en PLA, timol (6 y 8 % en peso) y Ag - NPs (1 % en peso). Las nuevas formulaciones se obtuvieron en dos morfolog\u00edas, probetas y pel\u00edculas con un espesor aproximado de 40 \u00b5m. En ambos casos , se llev\u00f3 a cabo una caracterizaci\u00f3n f\u00edsico -qu\u00edmica Resumen ~ 16 ~ completa y las pel\u00edculas tambi\u00e9n fueron utilizadas para evaluar la actividad antimicrobiana y antioxidante aportada por ambos aditivos. Los resultados de caracterizaci\u00f3n en las probetas mostraron que la combinaci\u00f3n de los dos aditivos tuvo una cierta influencia en las propiedades finales del material, particularmente en su degradaci\u00f3n t\u00e9rmica y m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico. Se observ\u00f3 un descenso aproximado de 6 -12 \u00b0C en el valor de T g de los nanocompuestos a causa del ya comentado efecto plastificante del timol. En las im\u00e1genes obtenidas media nte microscopi a electr\u00f3nico de barrido de emisi\u00f3n de campo (FESEM ) se pudo observar una buena distribuci\u00f3n de ambos aditivos y superficies homog\u00e9neas de los nanocompuestos que ratificaron la buena dispersi\u00f3n de las Ag -NPs en la matriz polim\u00e9rica. En el cas o de las pel\u00edculas se llev\u00f3 a cabo una extracci\u00f3n s\u00f3lido -l\u00edquido con posterior determinaci\u00f3n mediante HPLC -UV para determinar la cantidad de timol remanente tras el procesad o, que result\u00f3 ser aproximadamente un 70 % del timol adicionado inicialmente antes del procesado. El aspecto visual de las pel\u00edculas permiti\u00f3 apreciar superficies homog\u00e9neas y con buena transparencia tras la adici\u00f3n de ambos componentes. Esta propiedad fue estudiada mediante espectrofotometr\u00eda UV-Vis a una longitud de onda caracter\u00edstica de la regi\u00f3n del visible, obteni\u00e9ndose un valor de transmitancia en torno al 90 %. Una vez llevada a cabo la caracterizaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptica se procedi\u00f3 al an\u00e1lisis de sus propiedades t\u00e9rmicas mediante TGA y DSC as\u00ed como de sus propiedades de barrera. Los resultad os mostraron una disminuci\u00f3n del valor de T g en las pel\u00edculas debido a la adici\u00f3n del timol. La estabilidad t\u00e9rmica de las pel\u00edculas se vio influenciada por la presencia de ambos aditivos. Los valores de OTR no fueron significativamente diferentes para las formulaciones ensayadas por lo que no se em peor\u00f3 la permeabilidad al Resumen ~ 17 ~ ox\u00edgeno, pero s\u00ed que se observ\u00f3 un descenso en la permeabilidad al vapor de agua en las formulaciones con timol, y en particular en las formulaciones que combinan el timol y Ag -NPs, obteni\u00e9ndose una mejora en las propiedades de ba rrera al vapor de agua en torno al 36 %. Una vez caracterizadas las nuevas formulaciones se llev\u00f3 a cabo un estudio de desintegraci\u00f3n en compost a escala de laboratorio de acuerdo a la norma estandarizada UNE -EN ISO 20200:2006. Los resultados mostraron que el inherente car\u00e1cter biodegradable del PLA fue mejorado por la adici\u00f3n de timol y Ag -NPs en el caso de las probetas, obteni\u00e9ndose una degradaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida en aquellas formulaciones con presencia de ambos aditivos. Fueron necesarios \u00fanicamente 57 d\u00edas p ara conseguir un porcentaje de desintegraci\u00f3n superior al 90 %, cumpliendo de esta forma con los requerimientos indicados en la legislaci\u00f3n vigente. Sin embargo, en las pel\u00edculas \u00fanicamente se necesitaron 14 d\u00edas para conseguir su degradaci\u00f3n completa. Las muestras obtenidas tras el estudio de degradaci\u00f3n fueron analizadas mediante FTIR, DSC y FESEM (\u00fanicamente en el caso de las muestras obtenidas a partir d e las probetas), con el fin de determinar los par\u00e1metros afectados en la degradaci\u00f3n y los posibles c ambios estructurales. Los resultados obtenidos mediante FTIR mostraron una relaci\u00f3n directa con los cambios visuales observados a simple vista y con la progresiva degradaci\u00f3n de las formulaciones con el tiempo ya que se observ\u00f3 un claro descenso en la inte nsidad de pico relacionada con el grupo carbonilo (-C=O) de la lactida a 1750 cm-1 y una simultanea aparici\u00f3n de un pico caracter\u00edstico de los carbonilos, el \u00e1cido carbox\u00edlico formado por la ruptura hidrol\u00edtica de los \u00e9 steres. Las im\u00e1genes obtenidas median te FESEM mostraron importantes diferencias a los 7 y 14 d\u00edas de ensayo ya que aparecieron fracturas y Resumen ~ 18 ~ cavidades que evidenciaron la degradaci\u00f3n de los nanocompuestos activos, en particular la formulaci\u00f3n con ambos aditivos en las que las cavidades ten\u00edan h asta 2 \u00b5m de di\u00e1metro. Por \u00faltimo , el an\u00e1lisis t\u00e9rmico demostr\u00f3, tanto en probetas como en pel\u00edculas, que el incremento de la movilidad de las cadenas polim\u00e9ricas como consecuencia del proceso de hidr\u00f3lisis provoc\u00f3 la aparici\u00f3n de cristalinidad observ\u00e1ndos e picos endot\u00e9rmicos de fusi\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, en el segundo calentamiento se pu do observar un descenso en los valores de T g lo cual se relaciona con la ruptura de cadenas polim\u00e9ricas y formaci\u00f3n de nuevas cadenas de olig\u00f3meros con caract er\u00edsticas plastificantes seg\u00fan fue aumentando el tiempo de ensayo. La actividad antimicrobiana de estas formulaciones fue evaluada con los mismos tipos de bacterias ya comentados y los resultados mostraron una elevada inhibici\u00f3n por parte de ambos aditivos, siendo la actividad antibacteriana de las pel\u00edculas con Ag -NPs y timol m\u00e1s elevada en el estudio con Staphylococcus aureus en comparaci\u00f3n con los resultados obtenidos con Escherichia coli , lo cual se puede explicar por las diferencias en la membrana celular de los dos tipos de b acterias, siendo las Gram negativas m\u00e1s resistentes al ataque por parte de los compuestos fen\u00f3licos. Para evaluar la liberaci\u00f3n de timol en contacto con alimentos se llev\u00f3 a cabo un estudio de migraci\u00f3n utilizando etanol 10 % (v/v) como simulante alimentar io. Los resultados fueron obtenidos tras aplicar diferentes modelos cin\u00e9ticos con el fin de describir de la manera m\u00e1s pr\u00f3xima a los resultados experimentales los procesos de difusi\u00f3n del timol a trav\u00e9s de la matriz polim\u00e9rica y su posterior liberaci\u00f3n al simulante alimentario. Los modelos aplicados permitieron concluir que dicha liberaci\u00f3n de timol se pod\u00eda describir con una cin\u00e9tica de pseudo -segundo orden. Adem\u00e1s , se comprob\u00f3 que la adici\u00f3n de Ag -NPs limit\u00f3 la Resumen ~ 19 ~ velocidad de liberaci\u00f3n de timol, induciendo procesos m\u00e1s lentos al ocupar parte de los huecos en la estructura polim\u00e9rica que el timol utilizaba para su difusi\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de la matriz. Tras evaluar la liberaci\u00f3n de timol, se procedi\u00f3 a estudiar la actividad antioxidante de los extractos obtenidos mediante el m\u00e9todo del DPPH. Los resultados mostraron que el porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n aumentaba seg\u00fan lo hac\u00eda la concentraci\u00f3n de timol, es decir el tiempo de migraci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, el porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n fue m\u00e1s elevado en los nanocompuestos activo s, en particular, la formulaci\u00f3n con 8 % en peso de timol y 1 % en peso de Ag -NPs. 4. Conclusiones De acuerdo con los objetivos propuestos en este trabajo y a la vista de los resultados obtenidos, se pueden extraer las siguientes conclusiones generales: I. Se han obtenido pel\u00edculas de PP con 4, 6 y 8 % en peso de timol y/o carvacrol mediante mezclado en fundido y moldeo por compresi\u00f3n. La caracterizaci\u00f3n de estas pel\u00edculas activas fue llevada a cabo con el uso de diferentes t\u00e9cnicas anal\u00edticas y permiti\u00f3 demostr ar la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica de las pel\u00edculas tras el procesado. Adem\u00e1s , se comprob\u00f3 mediante DSC la disminuci\u00f3n de la T g y el desarrollo de cristalinidad de las pel\u00edculas activas, justificando de este modo un cierto efecto plastificante. Se observ\u00f3 cierta po rosidad mediante SEM, sobre todo en las formulaciones con una concentraci\u00f3n elevada de aditivo. Debido al efecto plastificante, las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas de las pel\u00edculas activas fueron modificadas, al igual que las propiedades de barrera Resumen ~ 20 ~ a ox\u00edgeno. Por ej emplo, el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico para las formulaciones activas disminuy\u00f3 en comparaci\u00f3n con el obtenido para el PP puro. La presencia de timol y carvacrol tambi\u00e9n aument\u00f3 la estabilizaci\u00f3n frente la degradaci\u00f3n termo -oxidativa de las pel\u00edculas basadas en PP, obt eni\u00e9ndose par\u00e1metros de inducci\u00f3n a la oxidaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s altos cuando se utiliz\u00f3 un 8 % en peso de timol y carvacrol, lo que sugiri\u00f3 que cierta cantidad de aditivo qued\u00f3 en la estructura polim\u00e9rica tras el procesado a altas temperaturas. II. Las pel\u00edculas con 8 % en peso de carvacrol y timol mostraron un doble efecto, ya que fueron capaces de liberar de forma controlada ambos aditivos y proteger de esta forma los alimentos de posibles degradaciones oxidativas y microbiol\u00f3gicas. Varios m\u00e9todos anal\u00edticos fueron desa rrollados y validados para determinar la cantidad de aditivo migrado en cada uno de los simulantes alimentarios utilizados. Los resultados tras el estudio de liberaci\u00f3n de los aditivos mostr\u00f3 que depend\u00eda del simulante alimentario y de la cantidad de aditi vo incorporada a la matriz polim\u00e9rica. Se calcularon los coeficientes de difusi\u00f3n y se comprob\u00f3 un comportamiento ajustado a las leyes de Fick de difusi\u00f3n. Los niveles de migraci\u00f3n m\u00e1s elevados se obtuvieron en isooctano como simulante graso, en especial p ara las pel\u00edculas con timol. La actividad AO aument\u00f3 con la liberaci\u00f3n controlada de ambos aditivos en funci\u00f3n del tiempo. Las pel\u00edculas activas con timol y carvacrol, pero en especial las de timol, mostraron cierta inhibici\u00f3n frente a Staphylococcus aureu s y Escherichia coli , en particular frente a la primera (Gram positiva). Las pel\u00edculas activas demostraron tras el estudio de vida \u00fatil utilizando fresas y pan de molde que son capaces de alargar la viabilidad y calidad del Resumen ~ 21 ~ alimento fresco debido a sus pro piedades antioxidantes y antimicrobianas. III. Se utilizaron una montmorillonita organo modificada (2,5 y 5 % en peso), D43B, y timol (8 % en peso) como aditivo activo para obtener nanocompuestos en forma de pel\u00edculas utilizando como pol\u00edmero base el PLA. Dicha s pel\u00edculas se procesaron mediante mezclado en fundido y moldeo por compresi\u00f3n. Alrededor del 70-75 % de timol permaneci\u00f3 en los nanocompuestos activos tras el procesado, garantizando de este modo su aplicabilidad en sistemas activos. Las pel\u00edculas obtenid as mostraron una excelente intercalaci\u00f3n de las l\u00e1minas de la nanoarcilla a trav\u00e9s de la matriz polim\u00e9rica, presentando una exfoliaci\u00f3n parcial, sob re todo las formulaciones con 2, 5 % en peso de D43B, as\u00ed como un comportamiento a la tracci\u00f3n diferente cuan do se compar\u00f3 con el PLA puro. Los resultados mostraron una cierta disminuci\u00f3n en el m\u00f3dulo el\u00e1stico debido al ligero efecto plastificante inducido por el timol, que, sin embargo, no afect\u00f3 significativamente la estabilidad t\u00e9rmica del PLA. La incorporaci\u00f3 n de ambos aditivos no result\u00f3 en una modificaci\u00f3n clara de las propiedades de barrera a ox\u00edgeno, pero s\u00ed que se observaron algunas diferencias en el color de las pel\u00edculas activas debido principalmente al cambio inducido por el color natural de ambos adit ivos. La transparencia intr\u00ednseca del PLA no se vio afectada por la presencia de los aditivos. IV. La liberaci\u00f3n de timol se determin\u00f3 mediante HPLC -UV a diferentes tiempos de migraci\u00f3n y se propuso un modelo cin\u00e9tico, lo que sugiri\u00f3 que la liberaci\u00f3n de timol estaba influenciada por la presencia de la D43B en la matriz de PLA y se calcularon los Resumen ~ 22 ~ coeficientes de difusi\u00f3n para todas las formulaciones con timol. Esta liberaci\u00f3n continua favoreci\u00f3 la actividad antioxidante de las pel\u00edculas, resultando en un elevad o porcentaje de inhibici\u00f3n en el ensayo DPPH. Por \u00faltimo, tras el estudio de la actividad antibacteriana, se concluy\u00f3 que la adici\u00f3n de la D43B produjo una mejora de la actividad de las pel\u00edculas. V. Los nanocompuestos activos formados por PLA como pol\u00edmero base, Ag -NPs (1 % en peso) y timol (6 y 8 % en peso) fueron obtenidos por extrusi\u00f3n en forma de pel\u00edculas y probetas moldeadas por inyecci\u00f3n. El estudio mediante FESEM mostr\u00f3 una distribuci\u00f3n homog\u00e9nea de los dos aditivos en la matriz de PLA. Estos resultad os fueron corroborados por el descenso de la permeabilidad al vapor de agua, debido tambi\u00e9n en gran medida a la presencia de timol. La T g sufri\u00f3 un ligero descenso debido \u00fanicamente a la presencia de timol, lo que se tradujo en un cierto efecto plastifican te. VI. Las pel\u00edculas activas con Ag -NPs y timol mostraron resultados muy satisfactorios en los estudios relacionados con su actividad antibacteriana, inhibiendo los dos tipos de bacterias a diferentes tiempos y temperaturas de incubaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como elevados porcentajes de inhibici\u00f3n cuando se estudi\u00f3 la actividad antioxidante por el m\u00e9todo de DPPH. La liberaci\u00f3n de timol y Ag-NPs desde la matriz polim\u00e9rica fue determinada a los 10 d\u00edas de estudio siendo la liberaci\u00f3n de timol muy superior a la de Ag - NPs. El est udio cin\u00e9tico sugiri\u00f3 que la liberaci\u00f3n de timol estaba influenciada por la presencia de Ag -NPs en la matriz de PLA. VII. El estudio de degradaci\u00f3n de todos los nanocompuestos activos en condiciones de compostaje demostr\u00f3 el car\u00e1cter biodegradable Resumen ~ 23 ~ del PLA, aunq ue la incorporaci\u00f3n de 8 % en peso de timol favoreci\u00f3 la velocidad de desintegraci\u00f3n, debido a la presencia del grupo hidroxilo en su estructura. Adem\u00e1s, la combinaci\u00f3n de timol y Ag -NPs o timol y D43B provoc\u00f3 mayores velocidades de degradaci\u00f3n, traduci\u00e9nd ose en ventajas medioambientales. VIII. En resumen, las pel\u00edculas activas con 2,5 % en peso de D43B y 8 % en peso de timol basadas en PLA; y las pel\u00edculas activas utilizando tambi\u00e9n PLA con 1 % en peso de Ag -NPs y 8 % en peso de timol pueden ser consideradas com o posibles alternativas a envases activos con matrices polim\u00e9ricas convencionales al presentar car\u00e1cter biodegradable y propiedades antimicrobianas y antioxidantes. Por todo ello, y como conclusi\u00f3n general del presente trabajo de investigaci\u00f3n, se puede a firmar que la adici\u00f3n de componentes activos con propiedades antimicrobianas y antioxidantes, tales como carvacrol y timol, a pol\u00edmeros convencionales (PP) o de fuentes renovables y caracter\u00edstica s biodegradable s (PLA) en aplicaciones de envasado alimentar io muestran un gran potencial para mejorar la calidad y seguridad alimentarias. En particular, la capacidad de liberaci\u00f3n, tanto desde matrices de PP como de PLA, ha mostrado el gran potencial de estos sistemas para ser utilizados como envases con caracter \u00edsticas antioxidantes y antimicrobianas para diferentes productos alimenticios con el fin de extender su vida \u00fatil y calidad organol\u00e9ptica y nutricional. ~ I ~ Table of contents I. materials ................................ ................................ ........ 36 3.

Food packaging Plastic industries are one of the main production sectors worldwide and have experienced a continuous growth by widening their portfolio and applications window. The increase in plastics production has been reflected in numerous and important sectors of the World economy. In general terms, the plastic industries can be conside red a key enabler of innovation in many products and technologies in important sectors of packaging or textile. With a continuous growth for the last decades, global plastic production reached 299 million tonnes in 2013, with a 3.9 % increase compared to 2012 (Plastics -Europe, 2015) been recently observed in emerging countries, but it was not the case in the most developed economies. For instance, the plastics production in Europe is currently stable, with no increase in the last decade and similar figures were observed in 2013 when compared to those in 2002. Packaging, building and construction are the largest application sectors for the current production of plastics. Figure I. 1 shows the distribution of the plastics consumption in Europe in 2013. In particular, the packaging sector represents 39.6 % of the total plastics demand and almost half of them are used for food packaging in the form of films, sheets, bottles, cups, tubs, or trays ; followed by building with 20.3 % of the total European demand. Automotive is the third sector with a share of 8.5 % and the rest of applications comprise a total of 31.6 % and safety, ...46.3 Million tonnes Electrical Electronics Figure I. are currently considered one of the four basic materials for food packaging, together with glass, metal and paper. Plastics are adequate to satisfy the main function of food packaging, i.e. to maintain the quality and safety of food products from their processing to consumption, including storage and transportation. Packaging materials should Park and 2013) . 1.1. From conventional polymers to bioplastics Among the packaging materials, petroleum -based thermoplastics have been extensively us ed since their introduction in the Introduction ~ 5 ~ 1950-1960 decades. They exhibit a range of properties that make them suitable for specific applications in food packaging, such as their large availability; relative low water good processing capabilities; heat sealability; good aesthetic quality and many others (Siracusa, Rocculi, Romani Rosa, 2008) . The most important (PET), which exhibit many common properties ideal for their use in packaging, such as light weight; low processing temperature (compared to Auras and Rubino, . Table I. 1 some pr operties of the main thermoplastic polymers with interest in food packaging. There are some key properties that make thermoplastics one of the most favourable material families for food packaging applications. For example, thermal properties provide import ant information about during processing and their possible resistance high temperatures. Mechanical properties provide data on the ability of packaging materials to sustain their integrity under the influence of various externa l factors occurring during processing, handling, storage the Other important parameters, such Dhawa 2011) Introduction ~ Table I. 1.

Among the different forms (films, small and high packs, etc.) and low cost; while it i s well suited for recycling and thermal resistance is required due to its high melting point (168 \u00b0C), such as for hot -filled and m icrowavable trays (Fages, Pascual, Fenollar, Garcia Balart In addition, these properties be modified by altering the chain regularity content (tacticity) and distribution, and by the incorporation of by conventional thermoplastics in their application to food packaging, the raising societal conce rns about Introduction ~ 7 ~ the most recent policies implemented by authorities at the international level have introduced some caution on their massive use and uncontrolled disposal. For instance, in 2012, according to the Association of Plastics M anufacturers in Europe, 25.2 million tonnes of post -consumer plastics ended up in the waste upstream, of which 62 % was removed from the environment through recycling and energy recovery processes while 38 % still degraded in Nature, taking centuries to be decomposed into their simple constituen ts and absorbed by the environment. This problem has become a global concern, in particular from the beginning of the XXI century, since environmental problems, such as the climate change, CO 2 footprint and the noticeable shortage in fossil resources have propelled the search for better concepts and sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics for packaging. Reuse and plastics recycling are the most extended alternatives to disposal, but other possibilities are being studied for immediate implementatio n in massive production. Novel bio -based and biodegradable plastics for food packaging should be developed by strictly following the guidelines for the efficient use of natural and renewable resources, keeping the properties of conventional thermoplastics to preserve food quality and consumer safety, while reducing waste disposal and CO 2 footprint by offering new recovery options. In general terms, novel bio -based and biodegradable plastics could be obtained and modified from raw materials with biological o rigin, or more precisely from renewable a significant reduction in the environmental of waste disposal problems and alleviate the overdependence from petroleum and other non -renewable sources (Rhim, Park and Ha, treated by get waste streams treating versatile to get such as composting, bio -refineries and others. Among them, the use of novel bio -based and biodegradable packaging materials is recognized as one of the main trending topics in the research for new materials, keeping the guiding principle of the efficient use of renewable resources and their easy conversion into simple constituents to close the natural cycle ( Figure I. 2). Energy and organic recovery Figure I. to the European Bioplastics Association, bioplastics are defined as plastic s that are either bio -based, biodegradable or both. There are three main groups of bioplastics based on their renewable/non and -PA. These materials are characterized by their bio -based origin (most of them are obtained from sugar - rich fractions in the bio -ethanol production) and their properties are similar to those of the main commodities used in food packaging, such as polyolefins. However, they are non - biodegradable and their waste disposal is similar to conditions, but they are obtained from petroleum. They sho w, in general, good properties for food packaging materials but their production costs are high and they are not yet poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHA). These biopolymers are the ideal solution from the environmental point of view, but most of them fail in some of the key properties for food packaging such and This group of bioplastics has produced great interest by their high potential in becoming a sustainable alternative to conventional thermoplastics. Some of them are already produced at t he industrial scale, such as or starch -based polymers as in Figure I. 4. 10 ~ Bioplastic e.g. Bio -based PE, Bio-based PET, Bio of bioplastics have continuously increased and amounted to about 1.6 million tonnes in 2013 with almost 40 % of the production destined for the packaging market, which is the current largest market segment within continuous the bioplastics production for food packaging is also possible by the similarity in machinery and Introduction ~ conventional thermoplastics.

Introduction ~ 12 ~ Properties and applications PLA has a significant presence in the market; with a production has increased the potential of PLA as an alternative material to some conventional polymers, such other benchmark polymers, such as polyolefins and PET. These factors limit the use of PLA in the packaging industry (Hughes, Thomas, Byun and Whiteside, 2012) . In consequence m ost research focus on improving the mechanical and barrier properties of PLA by adding nanoclays, natural fibres or antioxidant (AO) additives for the PLA is classified as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, USA) for its intended use as polymer for manufacturing articles that will hold and/or package food. It has been also proposed for the formulation of transparent fi lms, but inherent brittleness and flexural properties of the polymer Introduction to the Burgos, Martino and Jim\u00e9nez, 2013; Burgos, Tolaguera, Fiori and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014) or the processing of b lends based on PLA with different biodegradable and non -biodegradable rs, such as PCL (Zhao and Zhao, (Jain et al, 2015) or cellulose acetate (Kunthadong et al, 2015) . Commercial PLA can obtained in different grades, copolymers It is known that the PLA properties vary to a large extent depending on the PLLA/PDL A ratio and their arrangement in the polymer chains it is commercially produced in different grades, with a T g value around 60 -65 \u00b0C, crystallinity degree in the range of 15 -74 %, melting temperature around 173 -178 \u00b0C and tensile modulus of Stolt, 2002) . These properties are adequate the production of a transparent, tough and brittle polymer, with mechanical resistance similar to PET and PS, and application in rigid containers for food packaging. It was reported that T g, Tm and crystallinity of PLA decrease by decreasing the PLLA/PLDA ratio (Jiang et al, 2010) . Commercial PLA has distinctive properties over other low toxicity that have helped to broade n its applications window. Indeed, it has been used in a variety of applications, in addition to food packaging, in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields (Albertsson, Varma, Lochab, Finne - Wistrand PLA has to be biocompatible and degradable into non -toxic in-vivo controllable (Lopes, Jardini and Filho, 2014; Salerno, Fern\u00e1ndez -Guti\u00e9rrez, San Rom\u00e1n del Barrio and Domingo, 2015) Production Lactic acid (2 -hydroxy propionic acid) (LA) is the single monomer of PLA and it is produced either by fermentation of commercial name for D -glucose) other sugars extracted from plants, such as sugar beet potatoes, LA has a chiral carbon atom and exists in two stereoisomers, namely L-Lactic Acid Figure I. 5.

This technique allows working below the PLA polymerization are mixtures of two or more liquids in such a ratio t hat its composition cannot be changed by simple distillation and they help water a PLA with molar mass up to 300 kDa. ROP is the most applied polymerization techn ique for PLA due to the possibility of an accurate control of the chemistry of the process resulting in polymers with high molar mass and low dispersion, which broadens their application fields (Albertsson, Varma, of lactide, a cyclic dimer of acid -lactide, -lactide, A and properties and degradation rates can be achieved by controlling the ROP process and the molar mass and stereochemistry of the monomers and ensure the qualit y PLA obtained by ROP. Small amounts of impurities, such as . 1.2. Active packaging The traditional concept for food packaging materials as mere containers with no interaction with the packaged food to avoid contamination ( i.e. passive packaging) has been recently changed by the of new paradigms where interactions have been permitted, promoting two new concepts: active and intelligent packaging . In fact, research in new developments in food packaging materials i s aimed by the increase in the consumer's preferences for fresh, healthy and -to-prepare food, minimally processed and convenient from the nutritional point of view. Consequently, the food sector has experienced important changes aimed to meet these demands while adapting to the global market, which implies an increase in time of food transport and distribution (Singh, Wani and Saengerlaub, 2011; Sanches -Silva et al, 2014) . The developments associated to the active packaging concept for food packaging producers and consumers should take into account the process of mass transfer and interactions between food and packaging materials (Figure I. 7). These interactions could be divided into different individual processes, which could appear all together or be partially restricted in each particular These the to gases and the po ssible degradation Introduction ~ 18 ~ of Ihl, design that leave behind the conventional pa ssive container. Figure I. 7. Interaction processes between food packaging materials and the environment. Active and intelligent packaging systems were firstly defined by the Framework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on food (Regulation_(EC)/No -1935/2004) : i. \"Active food contact materials and articles\" are defined as materials and articles that a re intended to extend the shelf-life or to maintain or improve that release or absorb substances into or from the packaged food or the environment surrounding the food. ii. \"Intelligent food contact ma terials and articles\" are defined as materials and articles that monitor the condition of packaged food or the environment surrounding the food. ~ 19 ~ Active packaging includes the use of additives, which could be defined as \"freshness enhancers\", able to of natural aromas and well as food quality and safety (L\u00f3pez -G\u00f3mez e summarizes the main causes of food spoilage strategies to limit or deactivate them. Figure I. 8. Mechanisms that can cause a loss of quality in food and active packaging applications. The chemical nature of the additives used for such purpose is diverse, other Introduction Active packaging includes the use of additives, which could be defined as \"freshness enhancers\", able such as resistance to oxidation and of natural aromas and flavours as G\u00f3mez e t al, 2009) . Figure I. 8 summarizes the main causes of food spoilage and the strategies followed Mechanisms that can cause a loss of quality in food and active packaging The chemical nature of the additives used for such purpose is diverse, verheating during transport and distribution. New developments in active packaging materials, methods and effects on food have been under study in the last few years. These studies are based on chemical, physical or biological actions to modify and control the interactions between materials, food and the packaging headspace to packaging Antimicrobial active packaging is commonly designed to reduce the risk from pathogen attacks to and to extend shelf-life al, 2013) . All them could be incorporated into or coated onto food packagin g materials to get AM packaging system. i. They should be able to get the controlled release of the AM agent from the polymer film in the adequate time to maximize efficiency. The fast release of the AM agent from the packaging material to food is quite common and this is an important drawback of these systems, since the effect of the active compound is limited in time. Introduction ~ 21 ~ ii. The use of harmless substances is a requirement in food packaging and not all the proposed AM agents are currently included in the curren t legislation as chemicals intended to be in direct contact with food. Antioxidant active packaging focuses on the improvement of the resistance lipids and reduction of shelf-life of food products. The use of active packaging materials with AO properties is relevant in many types of food, but particularly for dried products and oxygen - sensitive food (G\u00f3mez -Mu\u00f1oz, Catal\u00e1 and Gavara, 2014) . Moreover, some authors reporte d that the addition of natural AOs to polymer matrices can protect the polymer from degradation during processing, with the double effect of protection for the material and food through controlled release mechanisms (Peltzer, Navarro, L\u00f3pez and Jim\u00e9nez, 2010; Wu, Qin , et al , 2014) . Both types of active food packaging systems can be divided into two main groups. This classification is based on the incorporation of the active additive to the packaging material and the interaction between the agent and foodstuff (Bastarrachea, Dhawan and Sablani, 2011) . Most of them are based on the use of thin films of polymer where the active agent is embedded. i. Films that allow the release of the active additive by following a particular kinetic scheme. The AM and/or AO agent can be incorporated to the material either within the matrix or onto the material surface. The strategy for incorporation is relevant to control the release of active c ompounds from the material to the food surface. Different approaches have been proposed: Introduction ~ 22 ~ a. Packaging systems incorporating the active additive in a single layer, permitting a gradual release into food. b. Packaging systems with an inner layer which can be useful to control the release rate of the AM and/or AO compounds from the outer layer. c. Packaging systems with a coating layer containing the active additive. ii. Films that do not release the active additive but show a direct contact with food inhibiting the m icrobial growth or lipid oxidation on the food surface. Figure I. 9 shows the sch eme of these different interaction mechanisms between active agents, p ackaging material and food. All these strategies for the incorporation of the active agents to the packaging material and further interaction with food have shown their potential, but some drawbacks related to the full control of the release kinetics of th e AM and/or AO compounds studies the use of other strategies for the incorporation of active compounds to the packaging material permitting a more efficient release to food. These new techniques are encapsulation, a process by which small particles of core materials are packed within the wall material to form capsules to protect bioactive compounds Noronha, de Carvalho, Lino and Barreto, 2014; Wen et al, 2016) , grafting, which is one of the most promising methods to functionalize polymers (Schreiber, Bozell, reinforcement nanofillers with intrinsic Introduction ~ 23 ~ in Fortunati et al, 2014; Shankar, Teng, Li and Rhim, 2015) .

The proposal of new bioplastics, such as PLA or edible films and coatings, to plastics in active Park and Ha, 2013; Mellinas et al, 2015) and many formulations have been proposed. Some of them are discussed below. Introduction ~ 24 ~ Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez et study based on PLA 2.58 wt% of -tocopherol as active additive with food packaging (Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto -Valdez, Auras and Peralta, 2011) . optical and thermal properties were evaluated as well as the kinetics of diffusion of the active agent from the PLA matrix to ethanol and vegetable oil, as food simulants. an to ethanol with 5.1 % and 12.9 % of release respectively after 60 days. Authors also studied the influence of temperature in the release kinetics by testing their systems at temperatures between 20 and 40 \u00b0C. The release of -tocopherol from PLA films t o soybean oil was enough to delay the oxidation at 20 and 30 \u00b0C, compared with the oil put in contact with pure PLA films with no active agent in their composition. Jamshidian et al used the solvent casting processing to obtain films based on with ral They the release of all these AOs to dif ferent food simulants and calculated the kinetic coefficients. It for foodstuff protection and -tocopherol can be used as a natural additive. Wu et al evaluated the AM activity of films based on PLA combined with PCL and thymol as active agent (Wu, Qin , et al . that the matrix had a plasticizing effect by the decrease in the PLA T g values and crystallinity, but not affecting the thermal stability of films. The AM activity was also evaluated they re ported blends can be used as edible biopolymer matrices in active food packaging applications (Rhim, Park and Ha, 2013) . Indeed, chitosan oils (EOs) (Cruz - Romero, Murphy, Morris, Cummins and Kerry, 2013) . Gamma irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) were proposed to increase efficiency of the active films in food (Severino et al, 2015) . These authors confirmed the strong resulted satisfactory in the total inhibition of these bacteria after 11 days of storage, highlighting the strong bactericidal effect of this coating. of BHT and g reen tea extracts (GTE) on mechanical, AO properties of potato starch films Nisa al, 2015) .

It was concluded that the addition of BHT and GTE extracts resulted in the ion of methamyoglobin and TBARS values. Introduction ~ 26 ~ 2. Natural additives The selection of the most adequate natural compounds to be used as AO or AM in packaging formulations their activity oxygen or microorganis ms and their compatibility with the packaged food, while the continued release during storage and distribution necessary other factors should be considered in the design of as specific activity resistance kinetics and mechanisms, storage and distribution conditions, physical and mechanical properties of the packaging materials and organoleptic characteristics of food (G\u00f3mez -Estaca, L\u00f3pez -de- Dicastillo, Hern\u00e1ndez and Tobback, 2008) . All these considerations have led to the search for natural compounds to be used in active packaging formulations in substitution of the synthetic additives. Many studies performed to propose the use of compounds obtained from 2013; G\u00f3mez -Estaca, -de-Dicastillo, Hern\u00e1ndez - Mu\u00f1oz, Catal\u00e1 and 2014; Gyawali and 2014; Vald\u00e9s, Mellinas, 2014; Valdes et al, 2015) Natural can be from different sources, including bacteria, algae, and during fruits and with AM/AO ~ 27 ~ different natural sources proposed for their use in food packaging applications. from natural used in food packaging.

Films were obtained by solvent casting and their mechanical and optical properties were determined together with their AO performance and release kinetics.

Nanotechnology in the food industry Nanotechnology has developed in the last decade into a multidisciplinary field of applied science and technology, representing a revolution in many concepts in materials science. The novel properties and functions provided by nanomaterials and the increasi ng possibilities offered by working at the nano -scale, between 1 and 100 nanometers, has resulted in advanced materials with a large number of potential applications, including food industry (Cushen, Kerry, Morris, Cruz -Romero and Cummins, 2012) . In this general context, nanofillers have gained some space as additives in food packaging materials by their action in imp roving some of their key properties, including mechanical and barrier performance. There are many different terms to refer to nanofillers depending on their In particular, nanoparticles are defined as discrete entities with their three dimensions in the nano -scale (lower than 100 nm). 2009) .

Different methods have been suggested to nanoencapsulate active principles into food compounds working with aqueous solutions at RT (Ghorani and Tucker, 2015; Santos, Kamimura, Hill and Gomes, 2015; Wen et al, 2016) . Figure I. 14 shows some of the main nanofillers that have been reported for their incorporation into food contact materials to enhance their mechanical and barrier properties, to prevent their photodegradation and to preserve and extend the food shelf-life by their AM effect food packaging applications. Introduction ~ 43 ~ 3.1. Nanoclays Many types of commercial nanofillers have been proposed for their incorporation into polymer matrices to form nanocomposites. The initial research in this field was focused on the use of layered silicates, also known as particularly remarkable in smectites which are based on 2:1 layers distribution made up of two tetrahedral coordinated silicon atoms forming as aluminum or magnesium, could be known as intergallery or interlayer spacing and it is due to the regular stacking of the layers, as observed in Figure I. 15. The layers dimensions depend on the clay source and the preparation technique, but most of them show thicknesses around 1 nm and their length vary from nanometres to (Alexandre ~ The of native atoms by other cations gives functionalities and properti es to these nanoclays. substitutions could place predominantly in the hydrophilic surface, which is characterized by the cation exchange capacity (CEC), which is generally defined as milliequivalents of cations in 100 g of layered silicates (meq/100g).

These modifications are usually performed via ion exchange reactions and have the main aim of matching the polymer polarity. Other techniques, such in Mohanty, f organo - modified MMTs produce an increase of the interlayer spacing due to the large volume of the organo cations, favouring the dispersion of organo -modified montmorillonites (OMMTs) their individual layers in the polymer matrix and thereb y improving in a high degree the service properties of nanocomposites, in particular their mechanical and barrier performance.

The AM activity of silver and silver salts has been well known for centuries in their application in curative and preventive health care (Dallas, Sharma and Zboril, 2011) . Some examples include the use silver in the treatment of venereal diseases, fistulae and abscesses or in the (Klasen, 2000; Rai, Yadav and Gade, 2009) . decade, many researchers have reported the strong AM activity of silver, in particular when it is used as nanoparticles, against a wide variety of Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacteria, viruses and fungi (Kim 2007; and Gade, 2009; Sharma, ~ . However, the AM mechanism of the Ag -NPs is a highly controversi al subject, in particular when referred to materials in direct contact with food. These controversies are mainly due to their small dimensions, required to AM and subsequent exchange of silver ions. For these reasons, the mechanism of the AM action of Ag -NPs is not well known yet. morphological and structural changes found in the bacterial cells and the possibilities of Ag -NPs to penetrate inside the bacterial structurel due to their attachment to the cell membrane (Reidy, Haase, Luch, Dawson another mechanism to explain the of silver ions and Ag -NPs against bacteria (Rhim, Park and Ha, 2013) .

Results showed that the migration of under these conditions was far below the limits stated by the European in ensuring the possibilities of these formulations with Ag-NPs in food packaging applications. Introduction ~ 53 ~ 3.3. Nanocomposites in food packaging The use of nanocomposites is gaining some space in the food and beverage packaging market, although it is not yet widely introduced by the increase in costs of the final material and the strict legislative requirements regarding the use of materials in the nanoscale in food applications. Research is raising fast in this area and Table I. 7 summarizes some examples of nanocomposites in food packaging applications. The use of nanocomposites in food packaging materials has resulted in improving some of their key properties, cold , Cushen, Kerry, Morris, example, the addition of low amounts of metal nanoparticles or nanofillers to PLA matrices results in improvements in intrinsic poor mechanical resistance, thermal, and gas properties of this biopolymer. These are ess ential characteristics for packaging materials and have joined to key properties of PLA, including thermoplasticity, high transparency and biocompatibility, for its use as a valuable and sustainable packaging material (Ara\u00fajo, Botelho, Oliveira and Machado, 2014) . In general terms, the studies based on the use PLA increase in tensile strength compared with the unfilled PLA was around 40 % and 50 % respectively. Jollands and Gupta reported tha t the elastic modulus was around 4200 MPa for unfilled PLA and 5900 MPa for PLA with 4 wt% of C30B, while Introduction ~ 54 ~ tensile strength was 32 MPa and 59 MPa respectively (Jollands and Gupta, 2010) . thermo and mechani in PLA matrices obtained upon the addition of 10 wt% of nanoclay, and they are associated with the good dispersion level observed by using w ide angle X -ray (WAXS) to the high clay (Fukushima, Tabuani, Arena, Gennari and Camino, 2013) .

The mechanism for this increase barrier to gases is based on the higher tortuosity of the path to be fol lowed by gas molecules in the presence of oxygen (around 50 %).

Active Nanocomposites Activ e nanocomposites are particularly useful in emerging technologies in food packaging due to their improved structural integrity Introduction ~ the increase in AM and/or AO properties in most cases by the action of active additives and/or the own nanofiller. Nevertheless, the selection of AM agent to be combined with nanofillers is often a complex task by the lack of compatibility of many active compounds with some polymer matrices or by the poor heat resistance of active agents, polymers or nanofillers processing. The of active nanocomposites in direct contact with food depends on the such as plasticizers (Rhim and Ng, 2007) . In this se nse, the polymer matrix plays the most important role in regulating of additives and nanofillers by controlling the particle release or the homogeneous distribution of nanofillers. Much research is currently ongoing in this area by evaluating th e mix different types 2014) active nanocomposites. The main compounds of many EOs, such as -tocopherol (Dias et al, 2014) and hydroxytyrosol (Beltr\u00e1n, Valente, Jim\u00e9nez and Garrig\u00f3s, 2014) as extracts, such as alcoholic extracts of red propolis (Costa, Druzian, Machado, De Souza and Guimaraes, 2014) , play an important role in novel active nanocomposites.

Introduction ~ 61 ~ Results show ed that nanocomposites with Ag -NPs and C30B exhibited different AM activity against Gram -positive bacteria. While the strong action of Ag -NPs is well known, in the case of C30B the AM effect is mainly due to the strong of the of nanocomposite with C30B and Ag -NPs (20.8 \u00b1 3.1 MPa) and the nanocomposite with only C3 0B (19.5 \u00b1 4.3 MPa) showed slight increase when compared to the unfilled film (15.5 \u00b1 3.9 MPa). However, no increase was observed in the film with only Ag -NPs (15.3 \u00b1 3.5 MPa). Similar increases in TS of the active nanocomposite films by the addition of na noclays, such as have (Lavorgna al, 2014) . The Ag -MMT nanocomposites to analysis with XRD and X -Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to have a deep understanding of their chemical structure. The main diffraction peaks assigned to the MMT were modified in terms of shape and intensity and an additional peak appeared in Ag -NPs, corresponding to the (1 1 1) plane reflection of silver. In addition, the successful intercalation and the interaction between chitosan and Ag -NPs led to the enhancement of the thermal stability of active nanocomposites with clear improvement of their TS, mainly due to the better load transfer between matrix and fillers. AM tests were performed and results showed that a significant delay in microbial growth was observed after 24 hours with the active nanocomposites.

Biodegrada ble polymers should be decomposed in Nature by the action of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, in but these processes could vary considerably depending on the environment where they take place, since the mi croorganisms responsible for the degradation differ from each other and they have their own optimal growth conditions (e.g. industrial composting plants, soil, fresh water). These microorganisms are able to produce changes in the chemical str ucture of biodegradable polymers by reducing the long chains into simple chemical substances like water and CO 2 during anaerobic mobility, tacticity, crystallinity, molar mass, of groups and substituents present in their structure, as well as the presence of plasticizers and other also an important degradation (Shah, Hasan, and Ahmed, This process can be evaluated under aerobic Introduction ~ 65 ~ or anaerobic conditions International methods (UNE - EN_13432, Biodegradation is also associated chemical deterioration occurring in two steps (Shah, Hasan, Hameed and Ahmed, 2008) .: i.

Results showed biodegradation rate was significantly enhanced in nanocomposites due to the presence of terminal hydroxylated edge groups in modified kaolinite which started the heterogeneous hydrolysis of the after absorbing water from the composting medium. However, in the early stages (initial 6 weeks in compost), the presence of OMMT retained PLA degra dation, likely due to its higher matrix OMMTs towards microbial attack to PLA ester groups, as well as reducing the loss of oligomers which could PLA hydrolysis through chain -end hydroxyl groups.

Risk assessment and migration in active and different migration levels. These effects and the presence of materials in the nanoscale in formulations intended to be in direct contact with food raise some potential health and environmental risks to be studied active nanocomposites at the industrial scale (Sanchez -Garcia, toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of nanofillers have been put under discussion. The main concerns over the risks associated with the use of nanocomposites in food packaging are based on the lack of suffi cient knowledge about nanofillers and the significance of their interaction at the cellular and molecular level in the human body (Huang, Li and Zhou, 2015) . The evaluation of No migration of nanofillers should be expected in normal cases, but poor characteristics of packaging materials and the subsequent ingestion of food previously in contact with nanocomposites can con sidered as a potential exposure route (Huang, Introduction ~ 67 ~ Li and Zhou, 2015) . Consequently, the investigation of the possibility to apply nanomaterials in food packaging and clear assessment of the safety of these materials is necessary to permit the co mmercial distribution of active nanocomposites. The main studies should focus on migration analysis under controlled conditions to determine the real possibilities of nanomaterials to be considered a real hazard in food packaging. Migration is the result o f the diffusion, dissolution and equilibrium processes mass transfer of low molecular weight compounds initially present in the packaging material into or food simulants (Manzanarez are the main controlling parameter s in migration studies (Song, Li, Lin, Wu and Chen, 2011) . It has been stated that migration rates depend on mass transport parameters and the thermodynamic equilibrium between materials and food (Torres, Romero, Macan, Guarda and Galotto, 2014) . Many factors are essential to estimate the magnitude of the migration process from packaging films into food or food simulants and to know the concentration change of migrating species with time. The key point in desig ning a specific migration model in food contact materials is the determination of two fundamental parameters, the diffusion and partition coefficients which are specific for each system. In most cases, the migration of a particular substance from polymer f ilms is controlled by the migrant through the polymer internal structure, Introduction ~ 68 ~ which can be described by the Fick's second law (Po\u00e7as, Oliveira, Brandsch and Hogg, 2012; Huang, Li and Zhou, 2015) (I.1) where Cp refers to the concentration of the migrant in the material at time t and position x, and D is the diffusion coefficient which measures the rate at which the diffusion process occurs. D could be a value and characterizes the transferred substances move through the system. Active nanocomposites can be used in packaging applications as two - dimensional delivery systems based on the release of active additives to extend the shelf-life of food products and oxidative degradation processes. Indeed, the main role of active packaging materials is the release of functiona l additives onto the food surfaces tests contact mate rials should cover all those requirements established by the EU Regulation No 10/2011 on plastic materials in contact with foodstuff. Although the best approach to test migration is to work with real food matrices, it is not often possible by the complex c ompositions of most in non overall and us ing food Huang, Li and Zhou, 2015) . Table I. 9 shows the food simulants which are selected as model systems according to the current legislation. \u086f\u0896 \u089a=\u0870\u086f\u0896 \u089e Introduction ~ 69 ~ At the end of the contact period and depending on the selected food simulant, accurate analytica determine the precise amount of migrant in contact with food under the testing conditions.

Inductively trace as those present in nanofillers and nanocomposites intended for the use in food packaging. For example, Lavorgna et al quantifie d the concentration of silver released in aqueous solutions at RT from multifunctional active e time and temperature although, in general, silver showed a low tendency to migrate into food simulants (Artiaga, Ramos, Ramos, C\u00e1mara and G\u00f3mez -G\u00f3mez, 2015) . 5. Legislation The legislative framework associated to food contact materials includes many regulations, not always applicable in all countries, which have been discussed and turned on by considering legal and scientific assumptions applicable to the formulation, processing and use of materials i ntended to Introduction ~ 71 ~ be in direct contact with food. The European Union (EU) has made great effort s in unifying the legislation of different member countries. Traditional packaging systems intended to come in contact with food must comply with the legislation set up by the EU and extrapolated to the national level. But, the raising interest in production of active packaging systems has forced the EU and other administrations to set up the applicable legislation in food contact materials (Amenta et al, 2015) . The current legislative framework is represented in Figure I. 18, in particular for active packaging systems (surrounded by green lines). The Framework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 refers to all materials in contact with food, but it is mainly focused on active and intelligent materials, since it establishes the basic principles that should accomplish all materials intended for their use in food packaging (Regulation_(EC)/No -1935/2004) . The article 3 indicates: 1. Materials and articles, including active and intelligent materials and articles, shall be manufactured in compliance with good manufacturing practice so that, under normal or foreseeable conditions of use, they do not transfer their constituents to food in quantities which could: a) endanger human health b) bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the food c) bring about a deterioration labelling or article shall not mislead the consumers. The introduction of active and intelligent food packaging systems, which are supposed to interact with food and/or the package headspace, represents the appearance of new challenges for the evaluation of their safety and their harmless character to human health. From the beginning of the research in active packaging for their possible commercial use it was clear that regulations limiting changed to avoid the incorrect use of packaging due to the insufficient Introduction ~ 72 ~ labelling or non -efficient operation of the packaging materials (Dainelli, Gontard, Spyropoulos, van de n Beuken and Tobback, 2008) . The Framework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food contains some general provisions on the safety of active and intelligent packaging and sets the framework for the E uropean Food Safety Agency (EFSA) evaluation processes. substancesGeneral aspects Figure I. 18. European legislation in food contact materials and general aspects of the Framework Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and legislation applied to active packaging (surrounded by green lines). However, specific legislation devoted to active and intelligent materials was introduced in 2009. Regulation (EC) No 450/2009 was published to cover this particular situation in the case of materials designed to Introduction ~ 73 ~ intentionally interact with food. This regulation established specific rules for and intelligent materials and applied in harmonization with the general req the active and intelligent functions can be either directly incorporated into the packaging material or contained in separate containers (e.g. sachets or labels). It the procedures for the authorization of active substances in the EU. The main requirement indicated in this regulation is based on the risk assessment that the EFSA should perform to all the active compounds to be proposed for their commercial us e. In addition, a list of substances or group/combination of them to be used in active and intelligent packaging materials should be drawn up following the risk assessment of these substances by the EFSA (Vald\u00e9s, Mellinas, Ramos, Garrig\u00f3s and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014) . Therefore, only those included in the positive list authorized substances the EFSA may be used as valid components of active and intelligent packaging materials and articles, with the exception of these substances already a uthorized other substances continuously after positive evaluations EFSA, which allows the submission of new proposals for active substances, which must be accompanied by a risk assessment study (Restuccia et al, 2010) . All passive parts of active and intelligent food packaging systems are also under the EU legislation ( Figure I. 18). (EU) No 10/2011 and subsequent amendments and corrections (the of introduced on February 2015) , stated the specific measures to be taken account active packaging systems. This regulation provides e Introduction ~ 74 ~ overall migration limits admissible for materials in direct contact with food (10 mg per 1 dm2 of food surface area or 60 mg per kg food) to ensure the safety of the final material or article. It also establishes the specific migration limits for substan ces incorporated inside the polymer matrix that can be released after the extended contact with food. These limits ensure that the material in contact with food does not pose a risk to human health. It is indicated that the amount of active substances rele ased materials could exceed the overall migration requirements indicated in the EU or national legislations if these substances have been approved as harmless by the EFSA. The transfer of these active substances to food should not be include d in the calculation of the overall migration limit (Vald\u00e9s, Mellinas, Ramos, Garrig\u00f3s and Jim\u00e9nez, 2014) . On the other hand , as previously discussed, the growing concern associated with nanotechnologies and the human health has forced the legislative bodies to set up new regulations regarding the safe use of nanomaterials in food packaging applications (Bumbudsanpharoke and Ko, 2015) . The EU proposes the use of the European Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 as a guideline and reference for nanotechnology applied in food contact materials. These guidelin es were published on the provision of pre -packed food information to consumers on general food labelling and nutrition labelling (EFSA, 2011) . The main novelty of this regulation and the application to nanomaterials was that all food ingredients with a form of engineered nanomaterials must be indicated in the list of i ngredients, warning consumers of their use (Bumbudsanpharoke and Ko, 2015) .

The migration of active compound s may be achieved by direct contact between food and the packaging material or through gas - phase diffusion from the inner packaging layer s to . be subjected to microbial contamination that is mainly caused by bacteria, yeasts and fungi. Many of these microorganisms can cause undesirable reactions and procedure to incorporate AM agents (most of them synthetic) into food is by direct addition permitting to diminish , such as the rising consumer 's concern s for food s with synthetic additives in their composition, as well as some mistaken procedures in the addition to use of these strategies in processed food . AM packaging is increasing the attention from food industries to protect their products from microbial contamination (Kuorwel, Cran, Sonneveld, Miltz and Bigger, 2013) due to for minim ally Results 116 ~ Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007a) . Food packaging films allow the controlled release of AM additives into food in prolonged periods of time (including distribution operations) 2003; Ho Lee, Soon An, Jin Park and Sun Lee, 2004; Suppakul, Miltz, Sonneveld and Bigger, 2006; L\u00f3pez, S\u00e1nchez, Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007a; Peltzer, Wagner and Jim\u00e9nez, 2 009). Active food packaging with AO abilities is also growing as an adequate alternative procedures oxidation . The addition with vacuum or modified atmosphere has been proposed as a good possibility to preserve fat food from fast oxidative degradation (Lopez -de-Dicastillo et al, 2011) . In the AO additives incorporated directly into polymer matri ces can play a double role: (i) food protection by their release in controlled oxidation of fats and pigments (Del Nobile et al, 2009) ; and (ii) to protect the polymer from oxidative degradation during processing. In fact, the addition of AOs to polyolefins is a common practice for food -grade film manufacturing (Tovar, Salafranca, Sanchez and Nerin, ew possibilities offered by the use of natural additives in food packaging have produced a clear increase in and polyphenols extracted from natural oils (Peltzer, Wagner and et al, 2012) AM/AO additives derived from EOs are perceived by consumers as health y compounds and they have been proposed in the last decade as potential Results and Discussion.

Rodr\u00edguez et al studied addition of EOs to wax coating s to develop AM active packaging materials able to preserve strawberries from microorganism s contamination by the release of additives from the coating to food surface (Rodr\u00edguez , Batlle and Ner\u00edn, 2007) . Authors reported that there was no direct contact between EOs and food , so it was concluded that the natural volatile compounds (eugenol, carvacrol, thymol) present in the headspace packaging the main responsible for the inhibition of the pathogen s growth. In other study, carvacrol was added to chitosan -based films for active packaging and their antimicrobial efficiency - based a ctive material to increase more than 3 times the shelf-life of a complex bakery product with minimal changes in packaging and no Results and Discussion.

The release rate of AOs from packaging material s can be evaluated by migration studies, using aqueous dissolution and equilibrium the mass transfer of low molecular mass compounds initially present in the package into food sample s or food simulant s; and it is proposed detection and quantification in In spite the increasing concern on the use of synthetic polymers in massive applications, such as food packaging, due to their poor biodegradability and high permanence in the environment after use, these materials show many advantages including low cost, good processability and excellent mechanical and physical properties. P olyolefin -based films have been proposed for the development of active packaging system s by the combination of the polymer good properties (mechanical, barrier, optical Discussion.

The TGA patterns of other formulations were quite similar in all cases. In this way, the first degradation step observed in active films was associated to the the remaining amount of additive in the polymer matrix after processing.

In this sense, crystallinity, (%), of samples 3, a higher value for (%) was obtained for PP0. From these results, it could be concluded that the PP crystallinity changes elastic modulus was noticed. This decrease in crystallinity could be due to the interactions between the polymer matrix and additive molecules in the PP macromolecular network , in particular by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups and the crosslinking Results and Discussion.

For this reason, the evaluation of OIT in this work was carried out in two different atmospheres at 200 \u00b0C. This temperature was fixed since these tests require values slightly higher than those obtained for OOT of the pure polymer, and OOT for PP 0 was 195 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C.

These results suggest that a considerable amount of both additives remain in the polymer matrix after processing and consequently could act as active agents in these PP-based formulations . In this sense, the PP films obtained in this study could be used as AO films for food packaging applications in order to extend shelf-life of food products, and thymol introduced in each compound (PPTC8) showed some additive effect since results obtained fo r samples with 8 and PPT8) into food (Figure 1. 7). 3.2.4. Release k inetics of thymol and carvacrol from active films Information about diffusion coefficients of additives through packaging materials is very useful to evaluate the ir performance in active systems. The critical point in antimicrobial and antioxidant performa nce of these materials is the release kinetics of the active additives through the polymer bulk and to food surfaces . A deeper knowledge of the migration mechanism of the target AOs from PP films is necessary to obtain ~ 155 ~ information about the real possibilit ies of carvacrol and thymol in active PP-based materials. Therefore, some experiments were carried out by using four different food simulants between -based thymol .

Furthermore, for this simulant, at t > 120 h, the equilibrium was not well defined and in the case of PPT8 in isooctane the release values ob tained at the end of the experiment were close to 100 % . This result can be explained by into the PP -based film, reaching a plateau when the matrix is saturated with the simulant. However, many interactions take place from polymers into liquids. Moreover, it been that time -dependent relaxation process could occur as the result of the that takes place during the diffusion the the release rates change continuously the accurate analysis of the migration is difficult. The presence , until a plateau is reached. As isooctane increase of migration after reaching the equilibrium was observed for both active additives at 360 h. This could be due to a combination of temperature and lo nger time s in which the PP -based films were penetrated by isooctane producing the increase on the release of . It can be also assumed that the sorption of isooctane by the PP matrix and the consequent creation of void spaces could favour Results and Discussion. Chapter 1 the phenolic compounds (Manzanarez -L\u00f3pez, Soto - Valdez, Auras and Pera lta, 2011) . The experimental release data shown in Figure 1. 9 and Figure 1 .10 were further analysed in terms of a diffusion model in agreement with Equation 1.4. that the amount of thymol or carvacrol release d from the matrix can be estimated as being constant after 120 h, and once Equation 1.4 can only be applied to MF,t/MP,0 < 0.6; the use of this equation do not interfere with the assumed effect of the swelling -process in the mass transport by diffusion. Under these circumstances , the release of thymol and carvacrol from PPT8 and PPC8 to different simulan ts can be modelled by using Equation 1.6: (1.6.) where k' is a related to the release rate constant. By fitting Equation 1.6 to the experimental data (see solid lines in Figure 1. 9 and Figure 1 .10), the values It should be stressed that the Equation 1.6 has been selected once considered the border and limit conditions of the experiments reported in this work, since it describes a first order kinetic process (Reis, Guilherme, 1 ~ Muniz, 2007) . In general terms , the fitting of the oefficients with experimental data are higher than 0.96 all 1.11A and Figure 1. 11B, respectively. As can be seen, the linearity of the plot 5.0 0,, 1 1 FtF MM versus 5.0t was very good for both active data are well described by the proposed diffusion model for short -range The analysis of the diffusion coefficients ( D) (Table 1. 8) shows that process for thymol and carvacrol in different simulants theactive w ith D values ranging from 1\u00d71014 to 2\u00d71014 m2 s-1. This behaviour if considering that carvacrol and thymol the diffusion of compounds isooctane. In fact, D values for thymol and carvacrol are 4 and 6 times higher for this simulant than the average values for the other ones. This is, however, in line with the previous discussion and with results reported in Section 3.2. as well. It is also worth noticing that the magnitude of D values found for these films are one order of magnitude lower than those obtained for similar AOs and films (Suppakul, Sonneveld, and 2011a) , long -term release, or higher retention inside films, of AOs making them very useful for active packaging systems.

This method is very simple and it is based on the measurement of the clear zone caused by growth inhibition produced a film disk containing the antimicrobial agent when putting in direct contact with a bacterial culture (Singh, Singh, Bhunia and Singh, 2003; Weerakkody, Caffin, Turner and Dykes, 2010) . In this sense, when the PP -based films with the active agents were placed on top of the culture media, it is expected that both additives will diffuse from the polymer matrix into the agar in a radial manner, producing a clear zone of growth inhibition around the active film.

However, strawberries in contact with the PPT8 film remained unaltered after 13 days. At this storage time strawberries presented a physical deterioration due to the storage conditions, but it is important to highlight that microbial growth was not observed until the end of the study (15 days).

A high release of carvacrol was observed a fter 2 days with slower release rate after 5, 10 and 15 days of storage. This mec hanism of controlled release could lead stored samples also observed for strawberries. Regarding the thymol release, a similar trend was shown for both test food samples. Figure 1. 15.

Chapter 1 ~ 168 ~ Equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) is the most common packaging technology used to reduce the high respiration rate of strawberries. It is known can reduce the sense, the identification of the main compounds present in the headspace of the packaged strawberries was carried out ( Table 1. 10) with PP0 films after 4 days of storage at room and refrigerated conditions . One of the most importan t fruit ripening is the aroma and flavour , so the determination of volatiles is a very adequate tool to predict the decomposition degree of packaged fruits . In this t he major rries at 4 \u00b0C. These are in those obtained by other authors of and carvacrol significantly atmosphere inside packages during the storage of food samples due to their release from film s. This fact could be related to the inhibition of the volatile compounds identified under these conditions (Table 1. 10) that were not detected in samples in contact with PPT8 and PPC8 films after 4 days of storage. Results and Discussion . Chapter 1 ~ 169 ~ Table 1. 10. Identified compounds present in the headspace of food samples packed with PP0 films after 4 days. Bread stored at room temperature Strawberries stored at room temperature Strawberr ies refrigerated at 4 \u00b0C Time (min) Compound Time (min) Compound Time (min) Compound 1.4 Ethanol 3.2 Methyl isopentanoate was the main volatile compound found in the headspace of bread in contact with the PP0 film and stored at room temperature for results from the fermentation and/or lipid oxidation in it has been reported by other authors (Poinot et al, 2007) . In this sense, commercial bread samples in contact with PP T8 or PPC8 films after 4 days of storage were characterized by significantly lower amounts of ethanol, suggesting and carvacrol. The improvement on the oxidative stability of bread could be attri buted to the release of carvacrol and thymol resulting in the increas e of shelf-life. From these results it can be concluded that the release of both additives from active films to the headspace of the studied packaged foodstuff increased profile obtained by HS -SPME -GC/MS was found to be different for samples in contact with PP0 and those with PPT8 and PPC8, due to the modification of the food headspace composition by the presence of these additives. Therefo re, the release of thymol and carvacrol from the active PP films has shown to be effective in maintaining the quality of strawberries and bread submitted to different conditions. Finally, it can be Results and Discussion. Chapter 1 ~ 170 ~ concluded that PP films with carvacrol and thymol could be a promising alternative as active additives in PP - based films for food packaging with the double effect of their controlled release to foodstuff and their by using different analytical techniques order to the effect of carvacrol and thymol in the polymer during processing. SEM the active formulations comp ared with neat PP. presence of additives not affect the thermal stability of these compounds remained in the polymer matrix after processing a t high temperatures. The release study of carvacrol and thymol from PP films into aqueous and fatty simulants was also accomplished. Analytical methods the studied food simulants were successfully developed and validated. T he release of additives from films was dependent on the food simulant and the amount incorporated into the polymer matrix . In particular, Results Discussion study showed that carvacrol and thymo l incorporated into PP films at 8 wt% were readily released into different food simulants, but some quantities still remaining in the polymer matrix after 15 days. The release kinetics of both additives from PP films showed a Fic kian behaviour with diffusi on coefficients ranging from 1 -2\u00d710 14 m2 s-1; except for the diffusion into to the quality of strawberries and bread samples during distribution and sale. As a gen eral conclusion of this chapter , it , such as carvacrol and thymol to PP matrices in food packaging applications shows high potential to improve quality and safety aspects. In particular, the high efficie ncies of their release from PP active films point s out the great potential of these systems in AO/AM packaging of different food products to extend their shelf-life while avoid ing the to food .

Determination of thymol in films One of the most important issues in the development of active materials when volatile additives are involved is to ensure that of these chemicals remain in the polymer matrix after processing. In this case, the amount of thymol determi ned by HPLC -UV which in after processing in Table 2. 3. Results and Discussion.

Nevertheless, these losses ( around 30 %) are in the same range than those reported for other common losses be due in ion and the these additives to protect the polymer during processing. But, it is remarkable that the volatility of active additives is desirable in food packaging applications to promote their migration from the polymer surface 2001) thymol can be considered a good active additive in food packaging materials since a large amount remains after processing and ma y be released from the polymer matrix 208 ~ highlighted that the amount of thymol after processing was slightly in Thermal analysis Figure 2. and all nanocomposite films.

The primary cause of this process is a non - radical, 'backbiting' which is refered to the formation of cyclic compounds through intramolecular reactions betwee n the carboxylic end group of the PLA chain and the ester bond of the chain.

DSC was used to determine the T g values in all PLA -based films ( Table 2.3). It is known backbone giving a clear indication of the tough ness and ductility of the polymer (Hughes, Thomas, Byun and Whiteside, 2012) . T g results of these materials showed that the addition of D43B to PLA did not produce important variations in the polymer structure, as on the PLA macromolecular structure (and consequently on T g) was more important. In fact, the presence of thymol induced a decrease in more than 10 \u00b0C in T g values, regardless of the presence of D43B ( Figure 2. 3),. A similar behaviour was reported other authors in PLA formulations with thymol (Tawakkal, and Bigger, active additives (Byun, Kim & Whiteside, 2010; Hwang et al., 2012). This decrease in T g values could be explained by effect addition of thymol resulting in increase in the molecular mobility of the macromol ecular chains of the polymer matrix and the ductility of the final blend of PLA with thymol, with some reduction in the polymer toughness as will be discussed for the tensile properties of all materials. No other peaks were observed in the DSC curves ( Figure 2. 3), and it could be concluded that the addition of thymol and D43B to the polymer matrix did not change the inherent amorphous structure of PLA. ~ 211 ~ (a) (b) Figure 2. 3.

In fact, the enthalpic relaxation peak gradually disappeared due to the hydrolytic reactions at the beginning of the disintegration process. Yang et al related this behaviour with the moisture absorption under composting conditions, since water could serve as a plasticizer agent in PLA matrices (Yang, Fortunati, Dominici, Kenny and Puglia, 2015) .

Release st udy Active nanocomposites used in food packaging should release the suitable rates to foods quality storage. to polymer permit contamination, but obviously satisfying the requirements stated in the current food packaging legislation. The use of nanofillers in active packaging systems has revealed some ability in retarding the release of active additives from polymer matrices, improving action shelf -life (Campos -Requena, Rivas, P\u00e9rez, -Miranda and Pereira, 2015) . In this work, migration tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of the nanoclay in controlling the release kinetics of thymol from the PLA matrix to ethanol 10 % (v/v) ( Figure 2. 11).

Some differences in films colour were observed by the addition of thymol and D43B, being larger films of the nanoclay. Nevertheless, the intrinsic transparency of was not affected by the addition of both components. It was observed that most of the thymol i nitially added to the PLA matrices (around 70 -75 %) remained in the nanocomposites after processing, ensuring their posterior applicability to active systems. Results of the disintegrability tests under composting conditions showed that the incorporation thymol to PLA -based formulations could favour the disintegration of the polymer matrix, due to the presence of the reactive hydroxyl group in the thymol structure, while the presence of D43B did not show any influence in the disintegration perfo rmance.

The applicability of these active nanocomposite films in food packaging was evaluated by studying the release of thymol into an gesting that the release of thymol is influenced by the presence of D43B and the PLA matrix.

Since the PLA used in this study was mostly amorphous, a T g value could be determined in all samples ( Table 2. 9). It is known that T is dependent upon the polymer structural arrangement and corresponds to backbone (Hughes, Thomas, Byun and Whiteside, 2012) . So, it wa s expected that the addition of thymol could lead to some reduction in T g, as observed in Table 2. 9. In fact, binary sh owed a significant decrease in more than 10 \u00b0C on T g values (p < 0.05). This reduction was associated with the was added to a PP matrix (Chapter 1), increasing the molecular mobility of the polymer structure. A similar behaviour was reported by other authors for the addition of similar AOs to PLA with a remarkable reduction on T g values (Byun, Kim and Whiteside, Hwang et no relevant effect on the T g values PLA, with or melting not observed due to the mentioned amorphous structure of the polymer used in this study, remained after the addition of thymol and Ag -NPs to the polymer matrix.

The addition of 1 wt% of Ag PLA had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the elastic at nanocomposites were evaluated The addition of 1 wt% of Ag -NPs to PLA had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the elastic PLA -thymol binary being more evident for those with the highest content (8 wt%, p < 0.05). This effect could be due to the increase in polymer chains mobility caused by the presence of thymol in these formulations (Fabra, Talens and Chiralt, 2008) . These results are also related with those for mechanical properties of PP -based films in Chapter 1 and active PLA -based films with D43B. The combined action of thymol and Ag -NPs on the PLA mechanical behaviour was also evaluated. A ignificant PLA resulting in more flexible and stretchable materials (p < 0.05) . It could be suggested that the presence of Ag -NPs contributed to the thymol ability to increase the mobility, which also more effective dispersion of silver nanoparticles. These combined effects could be related to the presence of Van der Waals interactions between the hydroxyl g roups of partial surface the Ag - which affects the mechanical response of the ternary nanocomposites Ta lens and Chiralt, 2008; Shameli et al, 2010; Aguirre, Borneo 6.2. Films characterization Thermal properties on thermal obtained results are summarized in Table 2. 10. T g of PLA and all the active nanocomposite films was clearly observed, once again indicative of Results Discussion 2 ~ 265 ~ the amorphous ch aracter of the commercial PLA used in this study. No crystallization or melting phenomena were detected. The addition of Ag NPs to PLA (PLA/Ag) did not reveal significant differences with respect to neat PLA in terms of T g (p > 0.05), in agreement with Fortunati et al (Fortunati, Rinaldi 2014) and with values with differences higher than 10 \u00b0C with respect to the glass transition temperature of neat PL A. This reduction in T g is related to the higher mobility of the polymer macromolecules caused by the increase of the free volume in the matrix, promoting the torsion oscillation of the carbon backbone due plasticizing by the thymol. It the mobility of macromolecules (Gon\u00e7alves et al, 2013) . A similar shift to lower temperatures in T g was observed by the incorporation of thym ol to PP matrix producing a as discussed in Chapter T g was also reported by for PLA -based films (Tawakkal, Cran and 2014; Wu, Qin , et al , 2014) .

A first degradation step s tarting at 120 \u00b0C was also detected (data not shown), which could be related to thymol degradation. This result confirms, once again, the permanence of detectable amount of thymol in the PLA -based nanocomposites after processing. The main TGA paramet ers obtained, i.e. T ini determined at 5 % weight loss, and T max for the main peak associated to the PLA thermal degradation, are shown in Table 2. 10. As can be observed, the separate addition of thymol and Ag -NPs into PLA did not significantly affect the thermal behaviour of the polymer matrix in terms of T max and T ini (p > 0.05).

PLA is a transparent polymer with a transmittance close to 95% in the visible region (Table 2. as evaluation of the light transmission in the visible region (500 nm) revealed that all binary and ternary films with thymol slight decrease (p < 0.05) in transmittance systems Results 271 due to the colourless transparent appearance of this additive. On the other hand, the inclusion of Ag -NPs into PLA films also produced some significant reduction ( p < 0.05) in transparency, which was related to the prevention of light transmission by the nanoparticles used in formulations did not affect dramatically the colour and transparency of PLA films. Therefore, their incorporation into the PLA matrix could be suitable for food packaging applications without compromising to an u nacceptable degree its optical properties. Ag -NPs on the barrier properties (OTR and WVP) of PLA -based films are in Table 2. 10. Biofilms with oxygen food The OTR \u00b7e by neat PLA was not significantly modified (p > 0.05) in the presence of additives. The study of the water vapour barrier properties of biofilms is important to assess their possible performance as food packaging materials since one of their main functions is to decrease the moisture transfer between food and the surrounding quality barrier in biofilms could be considered as the balance between the hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics of all their components. In our Results and Discussion. Chapter 2 ~ 272 ~ case, WVP of PLA films was not significantly affected (p > 0.05) by the incorporation of Ag -NPs (PLA/Ag). This behaviour may be due to the spherical shape of silver particles and their homogeneous dispersion in Wang, 2014) . It has been stated that high water vapour permeability of films intended for food packaging could restrict considerably their use (S\u00e1nchez - Gonz\u00e1lez, Vargas, Gonz\u00e1lez -Mart\u00ednez, Chiralt and Ch\u00e1fer, 2011) . In this case, the addition of thymol to PLA -based films resulted in a decrease < 0.05) in WVP values for binary and ternary systems, up to 40 compared to thos e values obtained for the neat PLA film. These results could be explained by the repulsion to is a remarkable feature in food packaging applications, especially at high RH storage conditions. Similar results were found by other authors under the same conditions (23 \u00b0C, 45% RH), reporting a WVP value of 1.99 x 10-14 kg m m-2 s-1 Pa-1 for neat PLA, and a 25 % reduction in WVP for PLA films loaded with 4 wt% - tocopherol (Gon\u00e7alves et al, 2013) the decrease 21 % in WVP of PLA, which was attributed to the hydrophobic nature of this extract (Samsu ~ 6.3. Quantification of thymol in PLA -based films after processing The quantification of the actual amount of thymol present in the processed active films is an important issue since the high of in losses during extrusion further of thymol detected in Table 10.

Yang, W., Fortunati, ., Dominici, D. of General ~ 319 According to the proposed objectives and the results obtained in the present work, the following conclusions can be obtained: I. PP-based active films and after decrease active compared with PP. Th presence of additives not affect the thermal stability of PP, of these compounds remained in the polymer matrix after processing. II. The incorporation of 8 wt% of carvacrol and thymol as active additives into PP films for food packaging resulted in the possibilities of their controlled release with determination and fatty food simulants were successfully developed and validated. The release of the studied additives from films was dependent on the food simulant in the tests and a Fickian -type General Conclusions ~ 320 ~ model was developed for the release kinetics of thymol and carvacrol. The showed inhibition Gram -positive bacteria, in for thymol. PP -based active films were also tested in direct contact with food, clearly increasing the quality and shelf - life of strawberries and bread samples. III. Active nanocomposite films based on PLA with a commercial organ o-modified montmorillonite were prepared with 2.5 and 5 of remained in the active nanocomposites after processing, ensuring their posterior applicability in ac tive systems. These films showed an intercalated of films the addition of thymol and D43B, being larger films of the nanoclay. Nevertheless, the intrinsic transparency of addition of both compo nents resulting in fully transparent active films. IV. The release of thymol from PLA matrices was determined by HPLC -UV at different times and a kinetic model was proposed, suggesting that the release of thymol was influenced by the General Conclusions ~ 321 ~ presence of D43B since dif fusion coefficients were different for binary and of thymol favoured the antioxidant activity of these films in contact with food, which was determined by using the spectrophotometric an d thymol (6 and 8 wt%) were added into PLA matrices to obtain good distribution of both additives all through the PLA matrix, resulting in an improvement in water vapour barrier properties. Some plasticization of the matrix could with the addition of thymol the consequent decrease the glass transition temperature. Likewise, the presence of thymo l and Ag -NPs into the PLA - based films also had some influence on the thermal stability of the ternary systems, slightly decreasing the PLA behaviour at high temperatures. VI. Active inhibition of the growth of foodborne bacteria and in the radical scavenging activity . food suggested t hat the release of thymol was influenced by the presence of Ag -NPs in the PLA matrix General Conclusions ~ 322 ~ resulting in some protection of the nanoparticles to the thymol release. VII. The degradation study of all active nanocomposites under composting conditions showed that the inh erent biodegradable character of PLA remained after the incorporation of the active additive and the nanoparticles. In fact, the incorporation formulations increased the disintegration rate of the polymer matrix, due to the presence of the reactive free hydroxyl groups. The combination of could be an issue, such as in food packagin g. VIII. In summary, PLA -based films with 2.5 wt% of D43B and 8 wt% of thymol and PLA -based films with 1 wt% of Ag -NPs and 8 wt% of thymol showed their potential as bio -based active films with character and antimicrobial/antioxidant performance to extend the shelf -life quality of food products. As a general conclusion , it be biodegradable packaging high p otential to improve quality and safety aspects of the packed food. It should be highlighted that these systems could be a valid and successful commercial alternative to the current antioxidant/antimicrobial formulations in food industry, most of them invol ving the direct addition of chemicals to food.
