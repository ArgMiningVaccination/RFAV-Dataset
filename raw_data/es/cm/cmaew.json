Activated carbon filters to the world of weed. You can find them everywhere, from air purifiers, modern vacuum cleaners, and water filters. But why does charcoal have a place in all of these devices?

This gives activated carbon a vast surface area and plenty of spaces to trap molecules that pass through it in a liquid or gas form. In the - How do they work? Activated carbon filters work through the principle opposed to absorption, which involves molecules soaking adsorption refers to individual molecules sticking to the surface of an object. A common example of adsorption includes those small silica gel packets you find in new shoes and handbags by tying up water molecules. Activated carbon filters work in much the same way. As molecules present in smoke pass through them, they become trapped in the many tiny pores and cling to the surface of the carbon. - How are activated carbon filters produced? The production of heat. Typically, several types of coal, coconut shells, and wood are used as carbon-rich materials in this process. But how does the carbon in these sources become Well, manufacturers place them heat them to sweltering temperatures 600-900\u00b0C. After additional elements (mostly nitrogen) and then reheat the material once again to an even hotter temperature of up to 1200\u00b0C. This process changes of creating a molecule that which means they're likely to get caught up in the gauntlet of pores in activated carbon filters. Plus, carcinogens such as hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide can make it through. The bottom line: You'll still get high from toking on a joint an activated carbon filter. Sure, you'll lose some THC, and some small polar carcinogens will still make it through.

Is there any evidence that places them lot of effort into finding out how effective they really are. A 2018 study [[1]](#ext_res-1) published in the journal Chemical Research in Toxicology assessed the effects of charcoal filters on the free radical contents of cigarette smoke. Researchers found that they let 40% fewer of these unstable molecules through compared to non-charcoal cigarette filters. Another study [[2]](#ext_res-2), one published in the Journal of Biosciences, also landed on similar findings. The research found activated charcoal reduce p-benzosemiquinone a \"handle\" to a joint or blunt. They allow large quantities of carcinogens, tar, and toxins pass unabated. access situation means that non-polar compounds brought to radicals that contribute to carcinogenesis.
