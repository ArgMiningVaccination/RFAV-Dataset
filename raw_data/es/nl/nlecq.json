Universidad Veracruzana Facultad de Medicina Bach flower remedies are dilutions of flower material developed by Edward Bach, an English bacteriologist, pathologist and homeopath, in the 1930s. on petals for emotional and spiritual conditions, depression, anxiety, insomnia and stress. The remedies contain a very small amount of flower material in a 50:50 solution of brandy and water.
