Social and cultural functions Please explain the social and cultural functions and meanings of the element today, within and for its community, the characteristics of the bearers and practitioners, and any specific roles or categories of persons with special responsibilities towards the element, element constitutes intangible cultural heritage as defined in Article 2 of the Convention'). Social and cultural functions The element allows to preserve the identity and worldview of the Mapoyo people. Since \"being gained force; is aware now, especially the elders. This has meant that there is a strengthening of the culture and bigger love for it from its own grassroots structures. For Mapoyo people, the revitalization of their culture lies in their elders, their children and in the transmission of the ancestral knowledge from the first ones to the second ones. Such transmission occurs in formal education environments and homes, having the family as the space where most of the cultural revitalization processes take place, including social cohesion through practices linked to the element. In this regard, since the previous report, a greater involvement of youngsters in ancestral In of Mapoyo language possible translate the National Anthem of Venezuela and the well-known song \"Venezuela.\" In this regard, the inscription of this Intangible Cultural Heritage before the UNESCO Convention 2003 also allowed this indigenous community to have more presence in different spaces of the national reality. Along this process of accountability, the message of Mapoyo people has always been consistent and clear: \"Mapoyo culture is alive, and we are proud of it.\" Mapoyo people have maintained the transmission of their narrative related to the social organization, for example, stories like \"mass suicide\" and \"we are Mapoyo,\" a of how proud they are of their culture. Thanks to these stories, children have acquired a set of social norms, including values and story has - recreated in their own geography - that allows the preservation of the territory by the community. On the other hand, the efforts to build intercultural bridges between Mapoyo people and the Venezuelan daily reality aim to make youngsters go beyond their communities and learn a trade; then, they will return - as it has been the case in the last four years - as teachers and nurses in order to give back what they learnt, without losing their cultural identity. Since 2002, Mapoyo people participate - along with the Ministry of People's Power for Ecosocialism - in the turtle breeding farm project called Tortuga del Orinoco, an endangered species. In these spaces, children learn to preserve nature while favoring their social cohesion, reinforcing the vitality of their language. At the same time, these efforts allow the strengthening of their sense of territoriality and geography as part of their ancient practices. Assessment of its viability and current risks Please describe the current level of viability of the element, particularly the frequency and extent of its practice, the strength of traditional modes of transmission, the demographics of practitioners and audiences and its sustainability. Please also identify and describe the threats, if any, to the element's continued transmission and enactment describe of its viability and current risks Since the last report, in which different vulnerable practices linked to the element were identified, efforts have been double in order to within the community, especially among young feasible due its daily frequency. Likewise, Mapoyo language has reinforced strong foothold the same elder bearers they say \"today, there are more Mapoyo.\" Practices linked to hunting, fishing, and agriculture have been reinforced since the last report. The youngest members request to participate in including community, including children, women, and elders, is responsible for the goods obtained through hunting, fishing or gathering; at the same time, goods are equally distributed among all members. This important to highlight that during the term corresponding to this the not that negative if compared to other populations around the world. Mapoyo people faced the pandemic with their ancient wisdom medicinal plants; they managed to counteract the effects of the virus, and nobody died from such lethal and evil disease. They even gave the disease a nickname: \"el covito\" since it did not seem to be as hard as it was said. Nonetheless, these processes had positive consequences such as the strengthening of the traditional medicine within the community, and transmission of knowledge to young members, including the transcendence of the preservation of the environment since the knowledge of those plats helped the community overcome such difficult times. The community received support of the Ministry of People's Power for Ecosocialism in the preservation of the environment by training young members as park rangers, since Mapoyo people seek harmony between their members and the nature, as defenders of their natural habitat. The presence of violent groups and the illegal mining in the Mapoyo territory represent a constant thread. Young members feel attracted to those activities due to the money they produce; however, they suffer abuse and discrimination by miners. The non-compliance of the agreements by national mining companies is another constant thread; they don't follow the security standards on waste management resulting from mining activities, nor comply with reforestation. This in term of this of the Community Museum was terribly affected, and Mapoyo to repair it; this represents a thread for the transmission of the Mapoyo way of life to other communities, groups or individuals, the community. safeguarding measures on safeguarding measures described in the nomination file, and previous report, if any. Describe how they have been implemented and how they have substantially contributed to the safeguarding of the element during taking note external or internal constraints such as limited resources. Include, in particular, information on the measures taken to ensure the viability of the element by enabling community concerning order make Mapoyo culture more visible, and strengthen the process of language and knowledge transmission, in 2018-2022 the implementation of learning projects in the classroom community. Thanks to this, today the children know more about their culture and are proficient in their language. Classroom practices aiming to strengthen the use of their language continued. As a result, when children go to sixth grade they reach up to 60% of language proficiency. At the same time, it was possible to translate some songs such as the National Anthem and \"Venezuela\" so kids are able to sing those songs to national authorities and indigenous communities in different events, showing they pass their culture. The recreational realm contributed cultural theater based on Mapoyo knowledge, \"Peste Coco\" (a ball made of corn and archery have been recurring Mapoyo people; today, they feel they are more visible in the national sphere if compared to previous years. Based on the main goal - which is reducing the threats on the ancient Mapoyo territory - the community, institutions and researchers who this cause have followed the land demarcation process achieved in 2013, through a title that guarantees Mapoyo people the property of 261,493.29 hectares. For this, there has been an effective discussion and implementation of what they call Rules of coexistence, that allow the permanence of other nine indigenous groups in such area. These rules aim to guarantee the permanence of these different groups in that area and foster the characteristic brotherhood of Venezuelan and Latin American indigenous groups. Other that have been achieved environmental awareness. turtle, species. Thanks to this reservoir, it was possible to go from 30 nesting turtles to 2,000, laying down a great number of eggs in 2022. The project was implemented under the guidelines provided by People's for Ecosocialism. Safeguarding activities List that were out during this reporting period in order to achieve these expected results. Please describe the activities in detail note or any of During the term of this report, the Education Program of Mapoyo people continued. This program aims native and the Council of Elders. This strategy has been very successful, and it has aroused interest in history and Mapoyo culture among children. Today, thanks to the progress of this program, elementary school children are almost fluent in their native language; they are able their teachers in a proper way. Teaching an ancient language, in particular, has increased the number of students who reach able to understand and speak Mapoyo language. All this knowledge around language and the use of the symbolic contents in the community have become stronger. Evidence of this can be seen in cultural activities performed inside and outside of those areas inhabited by Mapoyo people. Thus, the translation of songs that will be sung in schools or institutions inside or outside the community has turned children into promoters ancient members, to get closer to their traditional instruments, dances and the performance of ancient rituals. Also, new generations have learned about work, management of natural resources, including information about diets, medicinal plants, house construction, childbearing and delivery care, and other knowledge that help them face daily and extraordinary situations based on the ancient knowledge of this community. ICH - Research During 2022, \"Oro Azul company\", a joint venture government participation, conducted an environmental impact assessment and Sacred Sites within the Mapoyo territory. The specialists involved in this research were professor Nury Orijuela, from Central University of Venezuela; and Likewise, between the Education Safeguarding Between 2018 and 2022, the practices to strengthen the transmission of Mapoyo language continued, focused on fifth and sixth grade a Mapoyo dictionary, including terminology that will contribute to language teaching. Today, this project is under construction and research, and it is conducted by members of El Palomo community. On the other hand, Mapoyo people have reported that after a hard effort by the community before the national education authorities, a high school will be open in El Palomo; there, they will continue with the same spirit of safeguarding of the local ICH, taught to students in early and elementary education. Promotion of ICH In previous years, the Murukun\u00ed Community Museum was an important place for Mapoyo cultural transmission, and hosted several exhibitions about the origin and history of Mapoyo people. The museum also presented cultural performances and many of community knowledge. However, during this term, the museum has been closed due to a serious damage in its structure, and there is not a place to perform such activities. This museum is very important for the promotion and visibility of the Mapoyo culture; in this regard, the restoration of this space for the safeguarding of these activities is a priority. The community has developed a demarcation In 2013, collective title of the ancient Mapoyo territory; for this, it was necessary to conduct a series of researches including the water toponym of the region, the hunting and gathering sites, and other areas linked to the history and cultural identity of Mapoyo people. During 2018 - 2022, the recognition process by the State is considered to be finished, but it is always subject to follow-up; this is a reason why the Rules of Coexistence stablished are essential. In this regard, it is very important to highlight how satisfied the Mapoyo people are about this accomplishment, since this is a strong recognition of their ancient heritage, including as well the consideration of the territory for the life and continuity of their people. As per the prior considerations, the Arco Minero del Orinoco project is a latent risk for this accomplishment; the exploitation of some of the natural areas included in such project has an impact on the demarcated territory. In order to minimize the differences and strengthen the coexistence between indigenous groups, mining companies other stakeholders in the area, the Mapoyo community created the Council of people and indigenous communities from the Mapoyo ancient territory / ICH-TAM, as way to safeguard and protect the land demarcation achieved. In this current period, there is a continuous work on the expansion of these Coexistence Rules that allow the permanence of nine indigenous groups - different from Mapoyo people - in their territory, including industries, locals, and merchants who also live in this area.

In this regard, 2022\" which took place in Caracas, allowed the assessment of the status of the relevance and significance of the existing measures; at the same time, this activity supported some ideas that contributed to the implementation of safeguarding actions taking into the reality, the problems and current aspirations of Mapoyo people in the short and medium term. Based on this, Mapoyo people have had a central role in the development and implementation of such lines of actions, always from the guidance and wisdom of their chief, Sim\u00f3n Bastidas; their captain, Argenis Bastidas; and their council body, all of them Mapoyo. It is important to highlight that every decision or action implemented has had the prior approval of El Palomo continuously of knowledge, and different generations participate in the implementation of measures adopted, and this is reflected in their daily life. Nonetheless, the Safeguarding plan - since the implementation of meetings,\" including the efforts to guarantee the continuity of the ICH - has been based on the adoption of frequent communication channels, through their institutional peers. However, and the Safeguard Plan resumed, especially since it was this staff who visited the ancient Mapoyo territory. Based on this, the meetings Mapoyo representatives, officials from the Center for Cultural Diversity, and heads of CVG-Bauxilum company have been particularly important the Mapoyo oral tradition and its symbolic reference points within their ancestral territory, aimed basically to the safeguarding and preservation of the environment, often destroyed by their mining actions. On the other hand, the public sector, with their technical support, is committed to comply with the rest of the safeguarding measures, including those that will potentially be included in the plan for the following years. Based on this, the State has delegated the Center for Cultural Diversity to coordinate along with the Mapoyo people activities were knitting, production and arrows, and games such as \"Peste coco.\" - In the last four years, there were assemblies for decision making processes on different subjects, to from an inherited ethnomedical approach. - The \"sarrapia\" (Tonka bean) is a very important plant for the economy of El Palomo; it was collected during the whole period.

The objective was to strengthen their abilities to protect and preserve their territory. - In 2022, there were health days in El Palomo. 320 health specialists participated and they provided health care to most of the Mapoyo people and members of other indigenous groups such as the ts\u00e1se and w\u00f6t\u00fcia. - Since 2020, Mapoyo people have the support of UNICEF for antenatal care in pregnant women, including school feeding projects for children.

It is important to highlight that in accordance with the experience accumulated in the last years, as well as their contribution to the Mapoyo cultural context, these people also communities like the Kurripaco and Ts\u00e1se communities. - In 2022, the State through the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security (IVSS, in Spanish) gave 15 old-age pensions to Mapoyo bearers, the main projects, aiming to the assessment and transmission of the element from formal education, the investment was $962.00. - harvesting was possible thanks to the work materials and equipment provided by El Palomo community.

It is necessary to say that by the beginning of the period 2018-2022, land demarcation of the Mapoyo territory was a solid and real fact, thanks to the hard work of the bearers of the element and the national Government. Thus, from that moment on, the activities conducted on strengthening the contribution given by the elders to the transmission of ancient knowledge, mainly from the encouragement to the full and active participation of youngest members in those community activities that are the ground of the social life of Mapoyo people. During the period of this report, bearers worked on the achievement of all the goals stated in the general Plan, or at least a great part of those goals. However, it is important to highlight that this has been a very irregular period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we all know the reasons. Such global scourge - fortunately with a very low impact among Mapoyo people - limited the many of the actions stated in the Safeguarding plan. The activities that were carried out - those that were a priority, especially in 2020 and a great part of 2021 - were focused on the preservation of their own lives, including their physical, mental, and spiritual health. In this regard, the community, and especially the also times of resilience translated into opportunities to promote more love, respect and pride for their culture and ancient territory in children through orality. Then, through theoretical and practical activities - and after gradually overcoming the pandemic - in important strategy and transmission. The participation of all members of the community in the continuity of the element has guaranteed the strengthening and recreation of traditional gathering places, essential for the continuity of the local intangible cultural heritage. In this regard, activities such as agriculture, fishing, hunting, games, among other traditional including the preservation of the environment, have been essential for the preservation of their own lives and for safeguarding. On the other hand, the support from different institutions and NGO's in terms of health and education was essential to guarantee the continuity of the element, especially in a place so far away from major cities - El Palomo, for instance. In conclusion, the of a community management done with few funds but with lots of human resources, and supported on the principle of self-sustaining practices. In short term - and besides the already community achievement - an active participation and joint efforts between private companies and NGO's is seen as beneficial by Mapoyo leaders, in favor safeguarding the Mapoyo oral tradition and its symbolic reference points within their ancestral territory.

Just like in the past, bearers are aware of those ICH components that are at risk, and on which in most cases actions have been carried out. For this update, the fact that the new goals involve all the members of the community has been essential; this includes visibility and participation of people with any key role in the safeguarding process, since they are aware of their importance and transcendence for the transmission of ancient knowledge.
