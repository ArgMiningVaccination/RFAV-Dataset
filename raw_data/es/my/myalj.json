Christian Tym 22 December 2016 3 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks go first and foremost to Vek Lewis, my thesis supervisor, for your phenomenal talents as a sounding board and seemingly infinite offerings of new intellectual threads for me to take up. I often feel that you understand what drives my research better than I do. Thanks for being with this project intensively when it has been humming along and for welcoming me back into the fold every time I drifted off into one side project or crisis of motivation or another. Thanks especially for all the times you ass ured the various university review committees that wonderfully insightful writing was bound to spring forth from my pen any day now. I hope you feel satisfied and a little bit vindicated in seeing this work come together as a coherent whole. This project would never have got off the ground without the support and direction of the presidents of the two Shuar federations with a presence in Zamora -Chinchipe. Thanks too to all the Shuar people who spoke on my behalf at 'Centro' and 'Asociaci\u00f3n' meetings, to those who shared their stories of sickness and healing with me, and most of all to those who welcomed me into their homes and treated me as family. When I arrived in Shuar country, I was entirely unaware of the fraught connotations of association with a whit e man. Contemplating it now, I am astounded and overwhelmed by the dauntlessness and faith in humanity these individuals demonstrated in their willingness to trust and help me. Even so, with a mind to the risk they took, I will avoid thanking any of them b y name and leave the rest of that story for another time. On that note, thanks also to my former partner Tiffany. It must have been hard for anyone in Ecuador to think the worst of me when I was accompanied by someone as gracious and 4 beautiful as yourself . Thanks also to Andr\u00e9s for your coffee, for Salinas and for the constant good vibes; and to Austin, Aliya, Roberto and Vanessa for unknowingly keeping me on my feet. Big thanks to Claude and Chloe. I'm not to deserve such Thanks to Sebastian Grant for your incredible artistry (see Figure 1) and to all the friends who are still willing to take me back now that this incredibly time -consuming document has been brought to the finish. Thanks particularly to Mum & Dad, for always standing for doing the work that you love, and to Carolyn, Jane and Michael for your support and your wise words when you stepped in back in 2009. To Sophie, Hamish and Mitchell: thanks for always being around and having something completely unrela ted to anthropology on your mind to talk about. Lastly, thanks to Viv, Vin, Boy & Kat, Liz & Nat, Pettit, Ibu, Charlie's Angels and everyone else at the Metro Theatre and all the other crazies slaving hard at bars and caf\u00e9s to make space for your music, p ainting, acting and merry -making.

What would be the full implications of the distinctive local various particular its territory? This project takes state healthcare in Ecuador, an 'intercultural state' according to its 2008 constitution, as a point of entry to answering these questions. By presenting and historically contingent, it argues for intercultural health as a break with t aking western knowledge systems as the universal arbiters for social policy. Instead, it proposes that the health -seeking preferences of indigenous minority groups -working with the example the Shuar nationality in the south -eastern Amazonian representative state healthcare within their territory. I argue that this is a question of indigenous justice, in light of the evident dramatic disconnects in meaning and disappointed expectations of people in their engagement with clinical healthcare. However for non -indigenous society, too, intercultural health lead to the further assumptions western biomedicine, thereby bringing a new diversity of approaches with which intercultural societies could address universal social problems. Yet the effort to forward a medical ethnographic representation of raises question of how meaningful it is today to speak of cultural groups, when these are inevitably cross -cut by transnational economic, religious and political -discur locations. The thus concludes with a suggestion for what we mean when we say we diversity. 7 TABLE the Geopolitics of Knowledge and Decolonisation The Politics of Epistemology in Traditional Medicine 35 Bioprospecting and the Encounter between Knowledge Systems 39 Shuar Healing and Traditional Medi cine Debates 44 De Facto Interculturality in the Borderlands of the Ecuadorian State 49 Chapter 2: Why Interculturalise? g the Epistemology of Medicine 56 Multi -Sited Ethnography and the Field of Research 58 Border Thinking and Coloniality 68 Interculturality, Critical Epistemology and the Anthrop 73 Pharmaceutical Bioprospecting and the Epistemological Encounter Culture, Knowledge and Turn 3: Shuar Healing 93 Quantitative Analysis of Interviewees' Health 8 The of Indigeneity Interviewee Responses 117 Health -Seeking Shuar Mining and Materialism in Valle y 142 Chapter 4: Traditional Ontology in the Sickness and Health of Twenty -First Century Shuar 148 'Maldad', Sickness and Power in Alto Nangaritza 152 A Mother's 'Maldad' 157 The Shamanic Diagnosis of Sorcery 160 Visionary Experience in Shuar People' s Lives 165 Power Vibrating on other Frequencies as Medicinal Plants, Materialism and the Disowning of Spiritual Agency 199 9 One Vector Amongst Many 203 Chapter Healing: i) Ximena Charip 218 ii) Matilde Yankuam 221 iii) Alma Tunki 222 The Mechanics of Disbelief in the Quimi River Valley 224 Distancing Oneself from Vision 228 Land, Plant Knowledge and the Predicament of Young Waged Labourers 234 The Development and Rationalisation of Shuar Communities?

Interculturality s been long -standing demand of indigenous movements as a corrective to the colonial heritage of the Latin American republics, which have been built on the model of European states at the expense of the intellectual and organisational heritage of the first peoples. It asks the question: what would the state look like if its institutions were designed to be representative of each health, economic prosperity and democratic representation? Of course, writing something into law does not automatically make it so, a relevant point for even minor legislation, let alone a r edefinition of the philosophical foundations of the state itself. The present research is an attempt to come to terms with all of the requirements and implications of putting interculturality into practice. Several preceding works on state interculturality have focused on the critique of putatively intercultural programs pushed forward by Latin American states . on intercultural education has pointed out that Llanes Ortiz, 200 8: 55-60), or may not go beyond an essentialist focus on indigenous language and folklore, ignoring 1 Usually translated as 'peasant' or 'rural poor', it a with state inter cultural programs while criminalising those who do not (Bolados Garc\u00eda, 2011 ). From this perspective, state initiatives at intercultural health appear as a positive step, but in practice may function as mechanisms for co -opting and sanitising cultural difference (Boccara, 2015). Common to these critiques is the argument that state - led adopting tokenistic elements indigenous of territories according indigenous themselves ing from the importance of these studies, the present research takes a different , more oriented toward providing practica l policy is informed by the hopeful political processes underway in Ecuador, Venezuela and Bolivia , where there have been openings to intercultural health policies that empower indigenous people s (Calder\u00f3n, 2010 : 54-58; Freire, 2015 : 70ff. ). Indeed, it free services within (Kelly, 2011) that constitutes the clearest precedent case study with past (see Alonso, 2004: 475; Knight, 1990). 16 pursuing the question of how the state competency of healthcare could be reconsidered, reformulated and put into practice by an intercultural state in the territory of a particular cultural group -the Shuar people of the Ecuadorian -Amazonian province of Zamora - Chinchipe. In this sense, this rese arch is a piece of applied political philosophy, for it has been carried out as if there were the political will to immediately begin drawing up a blueprint for implementing the revolutionary ideals of the 2008 Constitution.3 I contend that this research p rocess has allowed for new insights into the potential of and the obstacles to state interculturality, and indeed the way in itself is currently understood. The research also and policies to intercul turalise and decolonise the state in Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America and the world. With healthcare as its case study , the present project is also a piece of medical anth ropological research. A sophisticated picture of the cultural context in question is essential for the analysis of the extent of the potential differences in the ways cultures conceptualise and strive for health, the terrain on which these differences are most marked and their ramifications for intercultural state institutions. Importantly, this medical anthropological analysis is as necessary for biomedical science as it is for the practices of the Shuar of Zamora -Chinchipe, or whichever other group may st ruggle to see its culture represented and supported by the state under whose dominion they live. It is essential to interculturality neither biomedical science nor any knowle dge system can be elevated as the arbiter of truth and falsehood within its specified domain of social life. By drawing on secondary 3 In public statements, at least, claimed there is 'enormous political will' to make the public health system intercultural (e.g. Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 54). 17 sources as well as presenting my own analysis, Chapter 2 makes a comprehensive case for seeing by the socio - historical contingencies of its development. One might ask why multicultural rational social indigenous people form a majority demographic presence, but at the same time skeptical of the suitability of reconsidering the state outside I will argue continuously throughout this thesis that interculturality is not just a matter of justice for indigenous peoples. It is also a utilitarian indigenous society, because it illustrates th e ways in which cultural and epistemic difference points us to new ways to solve our current problems. Before moving to introduce the manner in which the cultural and epistemic difference that is concretised by Shuar people in their health -seeking practic es will be made visible in this study, there are two particularly relevant fields of social -science literature whose insights and flaws need to be brought into consideration. One is that of international public health, a field which, although certainly ove rlapping with medical anthropology, for the incorporation of traditional and indigenous medical knowledge and practice into the policies of nation -states and international institutions. Critical ly analysing the blind spots in this field illustrates the ways 18 in which the field's goals of making the best use of all the medical knowledge and resources at a society's disposal can be better accomplished by taking poi so, however, it is necessary to contextualise my use of interculturality and the intercultural in t he light of preceding work. The use of interculturality in this thesis follows intellectuals concerned imperative of decolonising epistemology have fundamentally informed a key element of the structure of this research : its efforts in Chapter 2 to deconstruct the a historicist and materialist interpretation of its development as a knowledge system. I also set these thinkers in dialogue with outside in with the complex and unexpected results of the ethnographic research as it is presented. Interculturality, the Geopolitics of Knowledge and Decolonisation question'. In 19 this debate, for now I will initially write in the hortative mode in order to explain my hopes and intentions in taking up interculturality as a frame for this study. Interculturality belongs to what Ramiro \u00c1vila Santamar\u00eda has utopian hor izon' (cited in 2013): model for relations between peoples and cultures that seeks to rectify the colonial legacy in the social and political institutions of Latin America. In Ecuador, indigenous peoples continued denied civic rights well into the second half of the twentieth century. Having won their human rights in struggles from 1964 -1998, Ecuadorian indigenous peoples had to then face the challenge the colour -blind politics of li and exploitative policies, and of the planning of projects and the definition of budgets that do not consider the particularities of the [indigenous] peoples and nationalities in their various enclaves within the national territory. These policies are designed from a singu lar reality, focused in and concentrated on abstractions like 'the development of the country' or 'the national culture' (2011a: 21).4 The challenge here is to re -evaluate the desirability of basic tenets of western political philosophy, such as developme nt, as well as whatever culturally peculiar assumptions we may find within the sub -spheres of states, such as public health institutions. According to Kowii Maldonado, it is necessary 'to define public policies that are thought out from as in their language' (2011a: 29). This was the principle 4 Translations from Spanish texts are my own. 20 behind the of the Kichwa term Tortosa, 2011) -as an objective of the Ecuadorian state in the 2008 Constitution. Although one might suggest Kowii Maldonado's principal motivation for indigenous peoples, his position can be supported by mo re general, utilitarian argumentation. One must not feel -good measures with only at the level of individual psychology. Distinct cultures' approaches to very concrete outcomes with origins in their histories. As such, the epistemic pluralism implied by interculturality has the potentia l to open up the conditions for dialogue between and the mutual enrichment of knowledge systems, a project that promises to be especially fruitful when applied to and The interculturality -and also cultural anthropol ogy (Descola, 2013a: 30) - is to ensure that it is not contained by a culturally specific understanding of the concept of culture itself. 'Culture' in this sense does not refer to all that is traditional and historic (Garc\u00eda Canclini, 1992). In the sense of referring to the definitive characteristics of given groups of people with a shared historical experience, the culture of a people includes all of the ways that they conceptualise, relate to, make sense of and act upon the various elements of their environ ment. In the contemporary of culture ways of thinking and acting from a minority position which are 5 According to Luis Maldonado Ruiz (2010: 85), 'sumak' can flowering of existence and creativity' (2011a: 26). 21 recognised (and e ven celebrated) so long as their impact on dominant discourses is nil (Santos, Meneses & as it: Multiculturalism is a which empties its own position of all positive content (the multiculturali st is not a direct racist, he doesn't oppose to the Other the particular values of his own culture), but nonetheless retains this position as the privileged empty point of universality from which one is asserting one's own superiority (1997: 44). The sleight of hand lies in the classification of western, and particularly Anglophone, society as free from cultural bias (Rosaldo, 1993: 198), at least to the degree that conservative, religious and nationalistic tendencies can be kept down by the liberal intellectual hegemony. The portrayal, by of contrast, most obvious current example being Muslim -as by their own culture serves to legitimise the dominance of western culture which of course is not framed as 'cultural' but as knowledge about reality. The way in which 'the cultural' constitutes a categorisation with re ourselves but in the 'false' ideology of others (1994: 6), similarly we only see culture in the conceptual flaws and limitations in the thought and worldview in hegemonic discourse into current debates in international public health on the role of traditional medicine, the dismissive posture toward of the notion of culture. Calls to recognise and make use of the knowledge and resources of 22 traditional medici ne date back prominently to the Alma -Ata Declaration of 1978 and, more recently, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Traditional Medicine Strategy (2002). that some three -quarters of the world's population rely on it as their source the argument goes that traditional should be recognised as a valuable public health resource and integrated into state healthcare bodies. This proposal could be said to complement the observation of the immense cost of to the entire world's population. Indeed, for this very reason the proposal has been criticised from sub -Saharan Africa as legitimising 88ff.). from contrast, there is little threat of outright rejection of western medicine and other technologies, a prospect that concerns some critics of post - colonial and post -modern theory (e.g. Nanda, 2003). Indeed, Lati n America is not external to the West but rather is largely different traditions. This predominately western q uality to Latin American society does not prevent the pervasive perception of its 'underdevelopment' -the notion that Latin America is eternally behind the more modern, advanced and sophisticated world centres of Europe and North America -a perception which in the Andean -Amazonian region in particular often manifests in the automatic esteem granted to all things that originate in the North Atlantic world: 'the magic of the modern,' to redeploy the phrase by Michael Taussig the attraction of th e sub -standard healthcare to which he bore witness in rural Colombia (1987: 274 -9). In Ecuadorian towns and cities, including those in the Amazon Basin, it is common to see native medicinal 23 packaged wit h 'Made in the USA' as a symbol of their legitimacy. In short, in Latin America traditional medicine is more vulnerable to assimilation by the paradigm of biomedical science than it is to overwrought veneration. The more relevant point in the Latin Americ an context, then, is to consider the workings of the geopolitics of knowledge in discussions of traditional medicine. If, as Catherine Walsh argues, 'knowledge functions like economics: it is organised around centres of power and subordinate regions' (2004 : 2), then one would expect to see evidence of hierarchical relationships between the various products and producers of knowledge. Already, there have been suggestions from the Ecuadorian state that the Ministry of Public Health would need to certify inter cultural health practitioners, 'in prevent charlatanism,' a systems is a highly developed tendency at the international level. The pharmaceutical industry influenced (Mullard, 2010), Geneva -based WHO self-designates acceptable and unacceptable traditional medicine according to a mix of the science and culturally embedded norms and moral and aesthetic preferences i ' given that 'the quality of herbal products sold is 4). The principles of TM/CAM medicine/complementary and medicine]' the oft -repeated goal of 'rational use' (WHO, 2002: 5). Yet these seemingly common -sense signifiers point to a hegemony of one particular practice of knowledge -biomedical science -that is sustained over and above other systems. If we are unwilling to accept the mystification or exoticisation of indigenous healing practices, it is necessary to demystify the discourse, or 'ruling relations' (Smith, 2005), that connect the institutions of biomedicine -from the WHO to pharmaceutical corporations, the US Food and Drug Authority (FDA), US and World Trade Organization (WTO) patent law, universities, public health ministries and position consciousness whether of the social relations mediated by money or of those organised as objectivity in academic or professional discourse (Smith, 2005: 13). Before beginning the discussion of contemporary Shuar health -seeking practices, then, Chapter 2 presents an analysis demonstrating how the socio -historical particularities of the ruling relations have epistemological consequences that shape the kind of medicine that can be envisaged and produced. Drawing on institutional ethn will grounding in everyday experience (Campbell & Gregor, 2002: 60), in this case that of Shuar people for whom, despite the multiplicity of healing products and practices in it only biomedicine that is considered officially legitimate and worthy of state -backed financial, technical and professional support. 25 The geopolitics of knowledge critique is therefore central. However it is but one part of the aforementioned 'decolon ial' literature that forms the theoretical and conceptual basis for and grows out of the work of social movements campaigning for interculturality and plurinationalism (D\u00e1valos, Kowii aldonado, 2011b ; Mignolo, 2009 ; Walsh 2007 , 2009 ). Much of this literature is of the indigenous movement and in Ecuador is closely aligned with marches and blockades that have been carried out numerous times since the 1990s (Acosta et al., 2 001; Macas, 1991 ). As Hugo Benavides writes, Ecuador 'has been erased, changed in every way possible to alter indigenous peoples into their own debates, not as passive policy and research projects, but as full 2004: 143; also Macas, 1991). The fact that it is even necessary for a people to be 'incorporated into their own debates' speaks volumes of the cultural that has inhered of terms policy. coloniality knowledge' theoretical these writers. The definitive proposition of the decoloniality group is that the traditional western forms of supposedly neutral and objective knowledge are fundamentally implicated in the project of colonialism. The starting point of t his thesis draws particularly on the notion that 26 colonisation of the Americas was the condition of possibility for modernisation in Europe: it provided not only the material basis -the mountains of gold and silver that became the capital for capitalism (Graeber, 2012: 312 )-but also the possibility of an international commodity trade contro lled by the colonial powers. It was this trade that required an abstracted body of knowledge about the innumerable details of the colonised world for the managerial purposes administrators. As 2006; Arnold, 1993; Hewa, 1995; Vaughan, 1991). Other notable fields of colonial knowledge were the development of systems of racial classification (Quijano, 2000: 247 ) and the -sovereignty) in international jurisprudence 9 for for the naturalisation of Europeans' from power and autonomy. The delineation of the and the irrational was essential to maintaining a detached of these formal colonialism, but has also outlasted it. 27 For the modern, colonial state, social sciences can be considered 'constitutive'; the forma tion of modern nation of on 'techno social (Castro -G\u00f3mez & Martin, 2002: ). In the exclusion of entire populations from the managerial domain of knowledge and political power clai ming eminence over them, '[t]he crucial interpellation is that of the population of the global South demanding the right to be able to live healthily I would by adding the right to live and develop according to their own cultures. Culture is be understood here as an as 'the all -encompassing myth [that] provides us with the horizon of intelligibility within which all of our ideas, convictions and acts of conscience must necessarily be located if they are to captiv ate our spirit' (Panikkar, 1996 ). Consequently, the to reformulate colonial epistemology necessitate the reformulation of the concept of government and state, precisely the objectives of the plurinationalism According to mono -cultural nation -state and not to simpl y which large bodies of populations are kept of any kind of social contract (2001: 186 ). In this way, the critique of the politics of knowledge implicates a critique of the state and demands the reformulation of both. 28 In this, the decoloniality program seeks to distance itself from multiculturalism tied to the liberal vision of individual subjects under the nation -state. Such political philosophies - though they have come to tolerate multiculturalism as compatible with the basic l iberal premise of allowing the individual the maximum possible freedom that does not impinge upon the freedom of others (Berlin, 1969: xlvi )-nonetheless tend to be jealous intervention in cultural contexts deemed to be violating rights, as defined from their own, liberal tradition (e.g. Kymlicka, 2003: 161 -2). It is this contradiction that has led contemporary liberal multiculturalism to form a sort of compromise nationalisms religious what he dubbed a stance of 'muscular liberalism' as part of the so -called war on terror (BBC, 2011 ). This elitist quality of liberalism can be traced back to John Stuart Mill himself, for his office with the East India Company convinced him that 'despotism is a legitimate mode of government when dealing with barbarians' (1869 [1999]: 10). In this way, liberal multiculturalism can serve to maintain the political space for expressed in terms of a defence of liberalism individual . recent crusade against Mexican -American Studies in is paradigmatic, (quite accurate) charges against it were the in students and a of proponents in practic e an for dividing and 7 As Orozco argues, Arizona's Public by arguing, believe people not exemplars of racial yet also American a synonym for White' -52). 29 conquering (see e.g. 2012; 2004; Weber, 2005).

In the case of education, indigenous culture ends valued instead of deprecated, are considered as part of the past and largely irrelevant to the indigenous peoples in the present day. In oth er words, interculturality becomes a token gesture of Charles Hale argues that is of 'neoliberalism's cultural project [...] pro -active recognition of a of and equally vigorous rejection of the rest' (2002: that came response is to understand culture as going far beyond the superficial differences that it ma nifests, thinking instead of culture Roy Wagner's proposal as thereby em bracing both ontology and epistemology. it comes to intercultural health, all healing practices should be understood as manifestations of the culture to which they belong. It is important to note that as a research program, decoloniality is not concerned purely with Latin critique (Escobar, 1995; Santiago - Valles, 2003 ). In this sense, it is partly a reversal of the much criticised area studies model of fixing the object of social research and producing knowledge about it for consumption at a centre of knowledge, particularly the United States and other North -Atlantic countries. Instead, the program seeks to examine 'hegemonic articulations and thereby produce knowledge about them for liberatory purposes (Ayora Diaz, 2007 ; Mato, 2000 ). This of thought is thereby paths of research, one of which is the inversion of the anthropological gaze almost entirely on the basis of the knowledge and the epistemological and ontological assumptions of the North -Atlantic 31 world. This fact should be understood in light of the preceding critique of coloniality, the geopolitics of knowledge and relations what counts a s as a credible knower' (Wylie, 2011: 233). Throughout the history of the Ecuadorian state it is only biomedicine that has been considered worthy of official support, such that its pre -eminence in the country is the artifice of an knowledge. Since being designated an intercultural state in 2008, and in fact ever since the short -lived Department of Indigenous Health was established in 2001, sm all steps toward in state healthcare have been taken. However, the process has been met with resistance at the level of institutional culture in a manner that reflects colonial As a Shuar community leader, nurse and Coordinator of the Department in Zamora described it to me: When they created the Departments of Indigenous Health in 2001, for me, sincerely, it was good news, to have heard that they created a national -level department for the health of the indigenous peoples of Ecuador. So I went to work with so much enthusiasm and so much hope, thinking that this was a great opportunity, but I found myself in more of the same. At the moment that I began to live in somebody else's house, they didn't allow us to develop our own way of looking at life, our own way of wanting to make health. [...] At the moment of arriving at the house, you might say, that was administered by mestizo8 people, it was so difficult: for them, they thought, 'You people, how is it that you're inside my house?' So we said, 'We don't have recognition.' At the national level, there were no laws or policies set out 8 The term refers to Latino people of mixed European and indigenous ances try. A majority of Ecuadorians identify as mestizo. 32 for the creation of these departments. It was simply done by decree. So there were many complications. This resistance is perhaps the reason why current intercultural health initiatives in Ecuador, while certainly beneficial, are also somewhat tokenistic. One example is the Intercultural') the majority an initiative highlighted as a success by the Director of the Ministry of Health's 'Direcci\u00f3n de Salud Intercultural' (Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 58). Researchers carrying out a case study there praised the 'Casa Intercultural del Par to' (Intercultural Birth a 60 percent increase in medically attended births (Arteaga, described minimal engagement -or even awarene ss of the that 'the protocols for putting the intercultural focus into practice were limited to vertical birthing, such that interculturality had been reduced to vertical births' (2012: 411). A danger of tokenism in intercultural health, too, is that initiatives flatten out the diversity between indigenous groups, which tions those of Shuar people (see Chapter 7, Section 3) and other indigenous groups. Though there is clearly some support for intercultural health initiatives on the part of the Ecuadorian state, the process of their implementation and fu nding has been piecemeal throughout the national territory. The fact that intercultural health projects have advanced furthest in Chimborazo and Imbabura (Calder\u00f3n, 2010: 58; Mignone both an extensive indigenous demographi c presence and long histories 33 of indigenous political organisation, suggests that the support of influential local political figures and organisations is important if any traction is to be achieved in actualising the state's principles in the area of inter cultural of indigenous organisations claiming to represent the sheer number of nation -building projects being taken on by various agencies of the Ecuadorian state, pose challenges for effective actualisation of demands competition between indigenous actors to engage with state actors in a manner reminiscent of the role of lobbyists or NGOs in other societies. In exchange for compromises with the state, these organisations gain a status further elevated toward their goal of being acknowledged as the legitimate representatives of their particular group. In this sense, the current relationship between the Ecuadorian state an d indigenous vis Ecuadorian state is further complicated by the latter's centralist character under Alia nza Pa\u00eds (AP) government (2006 -present ). This was demonstrated most dramatically with the closure in 2013 of the National Directorate of Bilingual Intercultural Education ('Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n Intercultural Biling\u00fce' -DINEIB) and its incorporati on within the Ministry of Education; the latter is under the control of an AP minister, while the former was controlled by the 9 'Under the corporatist regime model, Latin American states extended certain social benefits to the citize nry-including subsidies for food, agricultural credit; welfare, education and healthcare benefits -in exchange for the formation of particular modes of state - sanctioned organisation and political participation' (Perreault, 2003: 66). 34 indigenous leaders often seek to have institutions which they can control, but we go beyond this fragmented view of the state' (2012: post -script, in the very same politicisation of state institutional space by demanding allegiance (and at times public expressions of it) functionaries at all levels. taken as broadly condemnatory of public health policies in Ecuador under Alianza Pa\u00eds government. Since 2007 Ecuador has pursued many of the same goals advocated by the critical epidemiologists of the Latin American social medicine movement, whose major target of critique was the application of neoliberalism to public health in Latin America from the 1980s (Laurell, 2010: 80). Medical attention is available for free and the state has increased the public health budget by a factor of 4.5 since the c ommencement of the current administration. The healthcare budget is currently 25 times greater than it was at the turn of the century (Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica, 2015: 5). As such, public health policy is certainly to suffer both in marginalisation from the biomedical resources and expertise mobilised by the public health system and concentrated around the nation's centres of political and economy gravity; as well as the 10 Pachakutik is the political party created by CONAIE in 1996. 11 President of Ecuador from 2007 until 2017. 35 fact that the medical attention that does reach them is oriented around alien concepts and frames of references from their own. The Politics of Epistemology in Traditional Medicine The debate between plurinationalism and interculturality t subtle elitism correlates neatly with differences in the interpretation and application of research in medical anthropology and international public health. This would suggest that the divisions in both of the fields brought together in this research project rest on fundamental moral and philosophical principles. I will begin this section by developing a summary of these debates in the existing literature, while seeking to regularly connect them with the previously outlined de bates in political philosophy. Much of the literature deals with the relevant interstice politics and or, it considers the micro -context medical pluralism within the applied of co mmunity development, and often sidelines of the political philosophical barriers to the implementation of their research recommendations. There has been little research on the place of traditional medicine in public health that in corporates political -philosophical insights from decolonial political in constructing 'the field' and its background lite rature, much of which is not currently in dialogue. 12 A notable exception is the related debate surrounding the politics of medical epistemology Mgbeoji, 2006). 36 Many researchers of traditional focus on what they consider its proto -scientific characteristics, painting it as an empirical with of practices, which exist in an integrated network of culture and knowledge and cannot therefore be isolated and reduced to a 'medical' domain. Beginning with the former perspective, i t is clear that such an approach bound up materialism and a linear understanding of scientific progress indigenous they -like the Europeans a bygone era yet the technical instruments that an approach to traditional medicine -evokes the much -maligned 'denial of coevalness' between the primitive and the modern (Fabian, 1983 ). While such discourse is perfectly compatible for visions of governments and the project management of development institutions, it is too timidly reductionist a frame for the present study. In this section I will seek to salvage some of the pragmatic elements of the materialist approach by navigating of post -structuralist critiques that sometimes threaten to leave -not even 'culture '-to 'frame' our research and 'fix' in place some degree of certainty about the subject. 37 The rationalist study of traditional medicine is Contagious Disease (1999 is that the seemingly mystical elements of African beliefs are in same underlying ideas about disease causation (aetiology) as those that are found in biomedical science. As well as being an impressive synthesis of many years of the work is also highly indicative of dynamics in the discipline of medical anthropology, as well as in international politics and development circles and the way both influence knowledge production. Green begins his work by sallying forth into the debate in medical anthropology between traditional medicine as proto -scientific practice, as he appears to espouse confidently, and the view that it is an elaborate system of situated knowledge that cannot be adequately understood - 'unfortunately [...] does not come from comic books and Hollywood alone. A number of health researchers and anthropologists have it diseases mortality [...] and biomedical aetiological models are in fa ct not very different in fundamental and important ways' (1999: 12). Shortly afterwards, in fact, becomes one more of style than of substance, for by the end of the the careful reader finds: Certainly a full descrip tion of every type of physical and mental illness in a range of sorcery and spirit beliefs are part of the 38 same cultural construction of knowledge as naturalistic, impersonal aetiology. But my argument is that those involved in promoting public health in Africa should take the trouble to learn about existing medical systems before trying to supplant them with what sounds to most Africans like Western scientific mumbo -jumbo (1999: 15). In other Green seeks biomedical science in Africa unchanged, but advocates doing so through the use of the existing indigenous terminology of health and illness delimited understanding of the potential of the encounter between knowledge systems is perhaps unsurprising in light of the fact that the project was brought to fruition through development funding from international institutions (Green, 1999: 9).

Through the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy (2002), following on from the Alma Ata Declaration (19 78), the WHO backs the legitimacy of traditional medicine in the realm of western -dominated 'global governance' of health policy. Green justifies his support of this endeavour at length in an analysis of medical and public health journals, showing that ove rwhelmingly, the denigration of on practitioners the imperative to reconsider his own conceptual frame through the cross -cultural encounter .

The suggestion, instead, is humanist: the other is in fact just like us, and moreover it wo uld be somewhat offensive to believe otherwise. In this procedure we can see clear parallels between the political philosophy of liberal multiculturalism and Green's own line of argumentation: liberation is envisioned as achievable through the granting of equality, rather from this perspective, is simply an understanding of a particular cultural context that facilitates the translation and dissemination of one's own system of knowledge into that context. From the perspective of interculturality, by contrast, cultural set processes hold potential to be transformative for all parties (Walsh, 2002: 24 -26), rather than a program embedded in relations power that -existing cultural and epistemic dominance on all levels. Bioprospecting and the Encounter betwee Knowledge Systems of rationalising similarity with bodies of knowledge in western societies -40 was southern The ICBG Maya, as it was known, was unusual in that it based its collection of plant specimens of plants, and in this regard alone it was for some an important validation of indigenous knowledges. It was planned largely by two anthropologists with decades of experience in the region, Brent and Elois Berlin, who sought to create a su stainable development oriented alliance with bioprospecting researchers, so construction programs, but also to train local people in and scientific methods and to stim ulate local esteem for traditional knowledge (Berlin & Berlin, 2004: 474 -8). Th e Berlins' research -advocacy justified the decision to focus the study on local knowledge of traditional medicine by presenting Mayan medical knowledge as [...] based on astute and accurate observation that have only been elabora ted on the basis of many years of explicit empirical experimentation understood in light of the structure of the ICBG program, in which royalties to be received by indigenous groups could be expected to be between one and six percent of the total, which would then have to be shared with any host -nation institutions collaborating in the research (Greene, 2004: ).

Interestingly, the same description of indigenous medicine was the lead researcher in the ICBG Aguaruna, based on the medicinal plant knowledge of the Aguaruna people of the Peruvian Amazon.14 Walter Lewis, biochemist and ethnobota nist at Washington University, has depicted the development of Aguaruna ethnomedicinal knowledge as ). matching discursive employed funding suggest that presentation of the most advantageous way to present such proposals to US -based research institutes. This style of legitimising indigenous medicinal knowledge by presenting its most acceptable face to an audience operating within a rationalist, scientific paradigm has come under attack from some anthro They have critiqued the conclusion that medicine is as an artifice of the research process itself and a frame that shapes its area of study rather than simply representing it. Robert Pool, a who carried out research in Cameroon, to a . Moreover, he argues that 'by the very attempt to study and describe it as something discrete,' such research ends up 'not only creating an indigenous 14 The Aguaruna ('awaj\u00fan,' in Spanish) are a Jivaroan people who are closely related culturally and linguistically to the Shuar and participa te in cross -border activism and organisation with Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe. 42 domain but also reducing it to a somewhat inferior version of biomedicine' 15 ). From this perspective, the attempt to elevate a distant culture from the position of ignorance they are assumed to be in by the wider public to a reasonable degree of rationality opposed here not blatant cultural imperialism but rather Pool's use of the term 'witchcraft.' In hi s article, it is both a ill-intentioned act of sorcery, mirroring its meaning historically in the European context, and general theory of misfortune, the sub -Saharan African worldview that Pool argued is by a study of systems' in focusing their bioprospecting on Ma yan use of herbs - clearly the most acceptable form of traditional medicine science -the Berlins decontextualised healing practice of 'herbal fetishism' (Nigh, 2002 ).15 In the heated political debate around the ICBG Maya which eventually led to its cessation, particularly the accusations of biopiracy against the research group, Nigh sided with the opposition that formed around a union of healers and midwives, arguing: 15 A similar criticism has been made of state intercultural health programs in Mexico (Ayora Diaz, 2007: 143). the cultural context in which they create and apply that knowledge.

Moreover, these debates suffer from an extraneous desire to uncover the truth about a specific social without on the purpose or the conditions of possibility of their research. For the Berlins, the focus on the chemistry of medicinal herbs is a necessary method that mirrors the pharmaceutical in dustry's focus on isolated active ingredients capable of being and the domination and enhancement of nature.

Shuar Healing and Traditional Medicine Debates The Shuar situation parallels that of the Maya in that their knowledge of the therapeutic value of medicinal plants is but one aspect richer tradition, in of certainly range of health -seeking practices available to Shuar people in Zamora - Chinchipe, including in those a reas where clinical consultation and medicines are available. Its practice ranges the everyday use of herbal teas for ameliorating subtle, emerging health complaints; includes the use of a number of plant - derived tonics, most commonly a lcohol the management of conditions; and is also called upon to resolve severe health problems (some cases of which are presented in Chapter 6). In addition, many Shuar people seek out the advice and tre atment of professional herbalists, principally mestizos, in cities and Consultation with these herbalists, moreover, blurs any 45 preconceptions one have of herbalism as a proto -scientific, physiological form of treatment, as the prescri ption medicines may sit side -by-side with prayers aimed at divine forgiveness, or at uncovering source 'envy' Shuar This technical vocabulary shared between mestizo and Shuar healers points to the syncretism emerging in Shuar culture as its practitioners find themselves in greater day Shamanic Diagnosis of Sorcery').

Yet unfortunately, all by the aforementioned 'post -cultural ' pretensions of the secular western world, which assumes that those aspects of an alien knowledge practice which cannot be understood within western scientific epistemology are hopelessly bounded within a particular cultural subjective experience and have no significance outside of it.

The structuralist bias of placin g the social whole as the unit of analysis comes forth here. 'The value of the system,' L\u00e9vi -Strauss explained, is 'the sense that the group receives from the myth underlying the cure and from the popular system upon which the group' s universe is reconstructed' (1963: 183). Neither proposition is useful in context. For one, the importance of a shaman's performance is minimal and even the presence of an audience is atypical. Secondly, as we shall see in Chapter , Shuar social relations are individualistic 47 and extend beyond extended networks of true that of depending on multiple factors impacting upon the their inherited cu lture. These factors -the wage and discourses dramatic degree of intracultural diversity within the Shuar population even of as small a prov ince as Zamora -Chinchipe.

Taussig's solution is not to expand upon the representation of the shaman as both dupe and hypocrite, but rather to do away with the idea that this represents a problem to be explained. 'It is as if the paradox is an artefact of the Enlightenment,' h e writes (2006: 235 ); rather, 'the secret of the secret is that there is none, or, rather, that the secret is a public secret' (2006: 246 ).

By virtue of acting on both the mind and the body and intertwining aspects of therapy, herbalism and personal development (as will be discussed in Chapter 4), ayahuasca shamanism is the most potentially and complex Amazonian healing practices with which biomedicine could engage. this one Shuar prac tice seems to continually cut across the categories health, own physically, mentally, of aspects of human experience about which truth claims can be made, and the refusal to make such claims about other aspects of human experience, are arbitra ry artefacts of a cultural group's socio -historical experience. For this reason, the analysis and evaluation of one group of people's set of health -seeking practices according to the epistemology misses powerful than, say, the choice of a certain herb for specific ailment. For state health meaningfully an indigenous healing their structure and opera tions need to be reconsidered from the root, starting with the most fundamental ontological assumptions. 49 De Facto Interculturality in the Borderlands of the Ecuadorian State If interculturality as delineated thus far is taken as the point of departure fo r the debate on the place of traditional medicine in public health, the partisan positions delineated preferences from w ithin the norms established by science, to 'symbolic violence' of promoting the truths and practices of any one system of health -seeking knowledge practice outside its original context. Instead, interculturality simply uires institutions state be representative and supportive of the culture of the people.

The greater part of the sweat and ink expended in this research project has been dedicated to do cumenting these preferences between healing practices as held by Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe. 50 Chapter 3 offers a statistical summary of Shuar health -seeking practices in the province. Everything that can be explained quantitative to one or the other; and whether or not they are open -minded enough to pursue multiple options until they succeed. What emerges most forcefully as these declared preferences on the part of Shuar people are rendered visible is the diversity of their responses; there is little coherence in of interviewees who simply share and live on communally -titled indigenous Shuar territory. On the contra ry, the continuities are to be found along other faultlines: the greater willingness to see doctors people living in isolated regions on the education and soc ialisation of their children through visionary spiritual practices, in contrast with those who are closer to roads, television and electric lights; and the way Evangelical Shuar have abandoned elements of ancestral healing practice and redeployed others. T his of course throws the project of interculturality into confusion: if it was not enough to aim at remaking the foundational principles of a sector of the state, it turns out there is very little consistency in Shuar views (let alone 'indigenous views'), even within a single, small and isolated province. Is interculturality, then, a vain hope? And what does it say of our understanding of 'culture' that an attempt to delineate how to make a sector of the state culturally representative is so fraught with co mplication? Chapters 4 to 7 are an attempt to make conceptual sense of the Shuar interviewees' health -seeking practices in order to answer these questions. These are imaginary coherent body of Shuar health -seeking knowledge and practice as understood by Shuar people themselves, so as to illustrate their and medicine, each the just mentioned. I propose that each of these subsets of Shuar society in -Chinchipe is principally characterised by a distinct 'cultural the ancestral culture and ontology inherited by toda y's Shuar people. of as historically changing the culture of the people with whom they come into contact. If we accept that the decisions arrived at in moments of healt h crisis are indicative of people's most fundamental ontological commitments, then the health -seeking preferences of Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe reveal the most significant cultural forces at work on Shuar indigenous territory. These cultural vectors are geographic isolation (Chapter labour in the mining industry (Chapter 6) and the international discourse of indigeneity (Chapter 7). Geographic isolation is the product forces -notab ly state priorities of sovereignty and development and the conflict between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian states -and as such is an external vector, even though its effect is to bring more powerfully to the fore the ancestral culture of those Shuar people liv ing in the border regions of south - eastern Ecuador. A theoretical antecedent here Jill our theoretical vocabulary is much the same as my own. The notion of a vector not only implies an impact of specific magnitude, range, that surpass the separate pieces named 2013b: 386); and so on. As DeTemple puts it, all of these domains are 'bundled', in the sense that vectors are congruent with -seeking practices, as a vector it acts to modify not Shuar people's predominant productive activities, but is also suggestive of particular seeing world, River in Judith Butler's Foucaultian acts repeatedly and at a distance that is often beyond the control of those with whom said power originated (Butler, 1997: 91), a germ ane point for Shuar people experiencing biomedicine, wage labour and Evangelical religion at the furthest edge of the world - system.17 These nuances of intermingled external cultural diversity among Shuar people that is sketched quantitatively in black and white in Chapter 3.

They are not cultural vectors in a sense that would suggest their provenance within a single culture philosophical materialism; the waged labour regime in the region under study is implemented by a Chinese state -owned company with its own particular business culture; and the discourse of indigeneity combi nes history impacts Shuar culture as we shall in Chapter 3, they fragment any a these cultural vectors are not uniformly 'western,' just as they do not act upon a culturally homogenous group. On the other hand, the ontological and epistemological pres umptions of ancestral Shuar healing practices (documented in Chapter 4) continue to influence the way in which Shuar people are willing to adopt the cultural vectors that reach them (as we see in Chapter and Pablo Sem\u00e1n that culture should not, in a conceptual sense, 'concede itself to the infinite multiplication of agency and of collectives and difference (2005: 15 -16).

To extend the example, the Shuar practice of seeking out the visions experienced in dreams and 18 Harner's (1968) 'reality view' is a good approximation of how I use the term. 55 under the influence of hallucinogenic plants, which are held by Shuar people to allow them to access information about such non -ordinarily visible planes of reality, represents an 'epistemological difference' between Shuar and scientific, materialist practices of seeking out knowledge. My understanding of draws on Karl essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations' (1972[1845]): 145). It is used in this thesis to describe the distinct, traceable ways vectors shape how Shuar individuals understand themselves and their place in the world. The dissertation concludes with a reconsideration of the value placed on cultural diversity that is implicit to a utilitarian cal l for interculturality and plurinationalism. Every particular inherited culture of coping and surviving, but such sets of knowledge and prac tice do not advance and become more and more sophisticated in a period of weeks or months. If knowledges and cultures are constantly evolving or being destroyed in the ferment of history, we need to acknowledge and support those that have been bequeathed t o humanity in the present day. As such, indigenous culture should be recognised not just of human diversity, but as 'a synonym for that which has Chapter 2: Why Interculturalise?

As such, in this research the practice of multi -sited ethnography within Shuar territory is essential in order to minimise the bias inevitable when an anthropologist adopts the perspective of a particu lar family or household and subsequently claims to comprehend the culture as a whole. In the second section, I contend that such an ethnographic documentation of interculturality role for the non -indigenous anthropologist. The of bringing together critical epistemology and ethnography requires the 19 Mignolo's indigenous and colonial society (Domingues, 2009: 129). However, the encounter between western b iomedicine healing founded healing more closely resembles the classical idea of the colonial encounter on which Mignolo's theories appear to be modelled. historical contingency of systems of and the rulings relations sustaining them (see Mato, 2000: 487), while a lso making those of other societies comprehensible within the vocabulary of one's own. Both of these capacities are necessary for state interculturality to be politically feasible. moving to the latter in Chapter 3, this chapter presents a case stud y of medical science research in order to achieve the former. The example chosen as a case study is a pharmaceutical bioprospecting research project carried out in the for the (closely rel ated to the Shuar) upon whose medicinal plant knowledge the research was based. This encounter between medical knowledge systems brings both into starker relief, 'bringing attention to & 2014: This process of decentring modern western epistemology through interculturality forces us to return to a reconceptuali sation of the concept of culture itself.

This view is counterposed to seeing the domain of culture as the demarcation of on e aspect of the world within our own ontology, which is characterised by the presumption of a divide between nature and culture. Whatever our ontological commitments, the principle of interculturality requires as privileging the ontology one Roy Wagner's of worldvie w. As such, a further aspect of this interculturality as a distinct approach to the politics of the so -called ontological turn (Kohn, 2015) and its importance to epistemic pluralism, a theme to be discussed in the third and final section of this chapter. Multi -Sited Ethnography and the Field of Research Interculturality, understood as the political imperative of cultural representativeness in state institutions, requires that the automatic privileging of any particular kno wledge system be abandoned. In drawing comparisons regarding healing practices epistemologies then, of people with a range of different healing practices at their disposal w ould 59 appear to be the best guide. The documentation of such context of 'medical pluralism' has been a prominent topic within cultural anthropology around the world (Adams & Hawkins, 2007; Frankel & 2012; Koss -Chioino, Leatherman & Greenway, a degree of retooling required in order to employ the standard methods of cultural anthropology in the service of state interculturality. Medical anthropologists have often pursued research through close association with a single individual (Rubenstein, 2002), family (Crandon -Malamud, 1991) or small community (Greenway, 1998), which can open the way to profound insights on the personal and political identifications provoked and healing and by shifting relations with one's own and other systems of knowledge.

Alto Nangaritza, a region where Shuar people form a clear demographic majority, was inaccessible by road before the Correa presidency and only had its indigenous land s legally recognised in the twenty -first century. Access to electricity is rare, mobile telecommunications are non -existent and most elderly people, especially women, do not speak Spanish. Middle -aged people tended to converse in the Shuar language, but we re also proficient in Spanish. Another site, the small town of Kiim in the centre of Zamora -Chinchipe, is located just an hour and a half from the provincial capital, Zamora. Kiim was the first Shuar town where I was able to stay when I began fieldwork in 2013, though research went on for only a fortnight before being interrupted by the need to attend to visa formalities in the Ecuadorian capital. The town, which is situated at the edge of a forest reserve, has all houses connected to the electricity netw ork and many with satellite television. A further two 'centros' where interviews were carried out, Yanua and Churubia, are located just a 40 minute walk from one another in the Quimi River Valley in the province's north -east. I spent approximately two mont hs living and researching in these two tiny, family towns in 2014. Many of the interviewees here worked as wage labourers in the Mirador mine near the top of the valley, a multi -billion -dollar Chinese -owned gold ly oppositional toward the presence of the mining company.

Immanuel Wallerstein comments that the fundamental initial division between anthropology and sociology was methodological, observation and interviewing (1988: 528). Interviewing Shuar people o n their health -seeking practices, 23 Amazonian chicha with stones, placed into porous sacks and washed in small rivers by Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza in order to stun fish, which are then caught by hand as they float on the surface of the water and the motivation and rationale for their behaviour, represents a small step toward normalising the practice of taking indigenous people a t their word, just as sociologists treat interviewees who they consider legitimate approach now Spanish and out formal interviews, and in particular the use of an audio recorder, seemed to spur on Shuar men to dem onstrate their capacity for oratory and knowledge of public statements on health -seeking preferences from male heads of households; yet at the same time the success of this method found itself in perhaps too easy an aligment with a Shuar tradition in which the terrain of politics and the public is a large ly masculine field. Ultimately, women accounted a in shaping the Shuar perspective documented in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. Interviews were carried out in a semi -structured fashion. This allowed for Shuar people to describe health practices in their own terms, while also permitting a general stance on 25 The prestige now attached to the cap acity to engage with outside world has been the Amazon colonisation policies promoted by the in the which made development lending available in exchange for 234 -5). 67 each kind of health practice found in Shuar territory in Zamora -Chinchipe province to be delineated. The element of 'structure' in the interviews was to ask the interviewee, at moments where the conversation stalls, whether they make use of clini cal medicinal plants and in answer to questions about medicinal plants, but interviewees were prompted to offer an opinion on their use if they were not.

In Alto Nangaritza, by contrast, hospital care was some seven hours away in the best of cases, and that only for residents of Shaime with close access to the one road out of the regi on. The clinic in Shaime was open two days a week; the doctors spent another two days of the week at a mestizo town several hours away and left around midday on Friday to return to their homes in the highlands for the weekend.

For their part, many Shuar people in this region saw doctors as the agents of genocidal conspiracies to poison or sterilise Shuar people with sedative drugs (see Chapter 3). Even so, as the following chapter illustrates, there was a high degree of pragmatism in Shuar people's attitudes to the offerings of state medi cal clinics, which are, after all, available free of charge. Border Thinking and Coloniality The clearest project Walter 'border thinking,' which begins with the demand to 'unravel the geopoli tics of knowledge from the perspective of (Mignolo, 2005a: x material progress (2000 of the of colonialism despite its formal end. A white person in the Andes is constantly faced with white supremacy on an everyday, mundane level; as when entering a store and not being required to leave one's bag with security guards as everyone else must. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui offers a painful example of the other side coin -the indigenous experience of white supremacy's influence on land ownership in Bolivia -in this quotation from a prominent land -holder: To rip these means, capacity or will to cultivate, and to transfer them to the 69 entrepreneurial, active and intelligent white race, avid for properti es, is in reality the healthiest transformation of the social and economic reality of Bolivia (1986 : 26). Countering coloniality animates the geopolitics of knowledge critique structuring state healthcare in Latin America: the epistemology of medical science, the pharmaceutical industry, industrial medicines, bioprospecting and p atent law. The colonial legacy continues to be evident in this domain, as much in the aesthetics as in the prevalence of the use of biomedicine in Latin America. In the North Atlantic world, these same assumptions of white superiority have buttressed econo arrogance is best understood genealogically through its development in the colonial encounter. As Linda Alcoff argues, the epistemological authoritarianism fundamental to the theological reason that initially justified the conquest of the Americas had to be maintained even beyond the Enlightenment critiques of theology, 'or else the colonial masters would have epistemic as into epistemologies t hat justified favouring certain groups over others with a measure of presumptive credibility (2007: 82). Or, as Santiago superiority As have observations resonate with the global governance of traditional we shall see, they are also clearly evident in the legal and scientific regimes that structure pharmaceutical bioprospecting. 70 Border thinking is the move into the space created by the geopolitics of knowledge critique. As Alcoff writes, 'double positionality is to the border's epistemic resources. If the subaltern simply champions what the West has disparaged, there is a risk that what is being ch ampioned is a western construct' mistake the in all white following the condemnation of coloniality and white supremacy. Once we have created this space, then, as Alcoff writes, '[t]he overall effect of this is something a practical knowledge approach to epistem ology itself, with a concern for the who and the how as much as the what' (2007: 97 ). The ultimate goal account envision the methods employed project realising in 94). ace multiple 'epistemic practices' can be conceived of as pointing at the same object from different positions. One can advocate for this position on utilitarian grounds as well as on the a 'knowledge system prioritised by the needs of people and the lessons of place' (2013: 94 ). In other words, we are talking about historically developed bodies of knowledge that make full use of the resources at hand. Medicinal plants that are known and used by 'ecosystem depended upon knowledge of their immediate 71 environment, can be assumed to be safe and are highly likely to be effective for their stated purpose. The few research projects on indigenous medic inal plants that have been carried out have borne out this result (Berlin, 1976; Lewis, 2003), with 75 -85 percent of plants confirmed (to the best of the abilities of medical as functioning as of Amazonian indigenous medicinal knowledge, what is known of this system suggests a high degree of sophistication. Ar\u00e9valo (1994) and Schultes (Raffauf, 1990) attest to very high degree of differentiation between plants a nd understanding of the effects of micro -climatic conditions on medicinal plants' efficacy. It has been suggested indigenous healers demonstrate a greater suggest that just like western medicine, Amazonian medicine is likely to be reaching truths about healing that other knowledge systems do not approach. As such, we are not relying on 'a 'the [...] 2013: 98 ). Border th inking is a particularly apt label and stimulating concept, but it is not blazing an entirely new trail. Numerous projects centre on the critique of western intellectual edifices and their social correlates in order to open space for either their reformula tion or for the facilitation of indigenous creativity that demands decolonisation as a first step. These critical research projects relevant empirical material is a part cannot be mapped concrete empirical study (Alvesson examples of 'critical emancipation -72 driven research' is the research program led by Charles R.

See Santos & Grijalva Jim\u00e9nez (2012). 73 Interculturality, Critical Epistemology and the Non -Indigenous Anthropologist There is a contradiction in the role of the anthropologist: living amongst people of a different culture for long periods of time and listening earnest ly and respectfully to any information offered, one is then expected to return to academia and produce rational order from cultural chaos. There is a certain schizophrenia in this mix of credulity and critical analysis, a position vividly portrayed by Mich ael Taussig (1987: 141 ) and in a common ambiguity of commitment to the truth of what is being in monographs. An of 'The shaman transformed himself a tiger, disappeared into the and uered the vengeful spirit plaguing his patient.' implied equivocal qualification -'My subjects but is especially for who experience events that they cannot (e.g. Fotiou, 2010). Bruce Grindal, an account seeing a become animated and begin to drum and dance during a in Ghana should approach interviewees' accounts of a healing by shamans and herbalists and reserve s a central for visionary experiences under the intellectuals should accept the fact that we have to start from where we are, and that this means that there are lots of views which we take seriously' ). us to summarily dismiss in the name of good sense are those belonging to 'Nazis and Amazonians' (1991: 31 ). The which are actually willing to 'take seriously' all the implications of t he worldview of their informants is questionable, and yet at least at the explicit level most would decry the position forward by In comments, Eduardo Viveiros argues that his admonition to spirit flight and being taken modus has become to avoid firm commitments and instead directly report the of world held by 'the themselves,' following example of the 'interpretive social science' of Paul Rabinow and William Sullivan (1987). In fact, Viveiros de Castro himself has been taken repre as 'flattening,' is no should expect indigenous people to behave according to this ' (2012: 183 ). She also provides ample support for those who would read her own position as an abdication of the role of the western anthropologist as the logical conclusion of privileging the views of invocation to ' extinguish the ventriloquist and make room for the voices of the Indians 75 themselves' (2012: 490 ). role of the anthropologist is simply to convey the knowledge of the people themselves, what is the place of a white researcher based in a wealthy nation -state like Australi a?28 This predicament was made all the more stark by virtue of having had no direct experience with Shuar people, language and culture before travelling to Shuar territory in early 2013. Why should I be striving to learn about and communicate Shuar knowledge when they could do so effectively themselves? And to what end should this cosmopolitan privilege to cross national borders and cultural spaces be directed? Interculturality indigenous peoples with her/his comprehension of the colonial legacy have served Kuhn's 2012: )-where -and in one's writing to make connections with culture knowledge in the compromised way inevitable to the efforts of most outsiders, but to at the same time take advantage of a privileged insight into the barriers to engagement with and support for indigenous culture and knowledge place d by the western world. Faced with western 28 This rhetorical invocation of my own positioning as comparable to that of o ther white researchers based in we althy countries should be nuanced by the recognition of the peculiar place that Australia occupies in the historically generated world Aboriginal peoples that proceeds to this day. See also the work of Irene Watson (2007) and Aileen Moreton -Robinson (2007). 29 This is not to preclude indigenous anthropologists from carrying out intercultural research in the same fashion. 76 epistemic hegemony, we must pluralise the ways we produce with a paradigm that exclusively values expert episteme , of oppressed peoples (Alcoff, 2007: 96 ). And must abandon the aforementioned ambiguous commitment to what is being recounted in ethnographic writing, and instead look to the experiences of people living in the intercultural borderlands, where distinct philosophies and their concomitant material manifestations meet, as they go about combining practices so as to satisfy their and to prosper. Such an approach draws not only on the theoretical and met hodological architecture constructed by decolonial thinkers in and from Latin America, but also the genealogical discourse analysis practised by the likes of Edward Said and Michel Foucault. Indeed, the two streams of intellectual analysis tend Escobar's (1995) The Making and the Unmaking of the Third World . This is not a coalition founded on shared 'post -modern' affinities for textual play of the author in constructing truth. Rather, the spirit o f work to be is that of researchers out of close historical analysis, demonstrating international agencies' focus on nutrition for 'the which them of essentialisms, categories and classifications. It is to this geopolitics of knowledge critique that we now turn. The ontological basis of western medicine is fundamentally defined by the position that reality is knowable solely through its own epistemology. All valid truth claims must emerge from best practices for clinical research that a re immersed in a political -economic milieu and figured in the language of a cultural -historic experience that colours research design and the communication and application of results. In short, biomedical science claims sole epistemic jurisdiction over pub lic health despite resting on culturally peculiar variables that have no necessary authority to monopolise knowledge of healing. To quote the Dalai Lama, '[t]he problem is not with the empirical data of science but with the idea that these data alone const itute the legitimate ground for developing a comprehensive worldview' health cannot exist within this order: rather, 'culture' can only enter the frame as a deviation from the norm, a crude which 'non 'cultural competence' initiatives. An example will aid in grounding these July, the of -language proficiency, against litigation and certification according to knowledge of TCM as set out by the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia. These seemingly common -sense measures were criticised by doctors and 'giving tacit government support to a field that was not scientific evidence shows it works, we'd welcome that. [...] Where is the evidence people haven't died? We want authority assumed by biomedical science. The key here is not to advocate for TCM in resistance to biomedicine, but rather, standing between the two, to move via critique to a more appropriate epistemology. As posited by the Ecuadorian intercultural university goal t the synthesise in dialogue between knowledges' (Llanes 2005: 201). This demands a reflexivity that is absent from much of biomedical of traditional medicine that TCM a didn't get the differential diagnosis. That's the core of Chinese medicine, which means that every person gets treated f or the reasons they got cancer, and the reason they have their symptoms might be completely different than the guy next to them. So it will never be practised that way. You can't give the same formula to 200 people, you cannot. Now you've broken Chinese me dicine. It's not Chinese anymore, 46). Applying the study of non healing practice is suggestive of an epistemological arrogance according t o which biomedical science has nothing to learn from the conceptualisation of health, illness and medicine in non -western health -seeking practices. The present research project looks instead to the more 79 productive approach of drawing upon the core insights of one knowledge system to inform the practices of the other. Such concern with the of normativity in medical science (Gane, 1998). A further point, to be explored subsequently, is that of chemical synergies, which has informed Chinese researchers in medical science (Yan et al., 2012: 5). It is this intercultural standpoint between knowledge systems that represents an epistemology that is appropriate for ethnography on the borders of the western political - economic system, and the critique of western epistemic hegemony is essential for the maintenance of this space. For this reason, we will now move into a case study of pharmaceutical bioprospecting in the Peruvian Amazon, which functions both as a critique of biomedical epistemology as well as of the ruling position of epistemic hegemony. the Encounter The International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups (ICBG) program, directed by the US National Institute of Health, National Science Foundation and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), was dedicated to exploring the potential pharmaceutical applications of medicinal plants and other so -called biological resources. As discussed in Chapter 1, the program featured two research projects in which the selection of plants to be assessed by pharmaceutical companies was carried out by Latin American i ndigenous groups. One of these was the ICBG Aguaruna (also known as ICBG Peru), named north in any area (Balick, 1990; Cox, 1990; King, 1992), with an awareness (NIH, 2002: 10 As a standard -bearer for responsible bioprospecting, the program was run with much greater intention to benefit local people -in terms of both compensation paym ents for local knowledge as as through research into local diseases -than would typically be found in private -sector it presents an example of what within the parameters of biomedical research on indigenous healin g knowledge and practice. The research team of the ICBG Aguaruna project managed plants were identified of the plants' uses. The project's partner corporation, Searle (then part of Monsanto and now part of Pfizer), paid 'the Aguaruna people' a know -how licence for make use of their intellectual property (Greene, 2004: 218). sample and agreed of the earnings Ramani, 2007: 405). of medicinal 30 The other was the aforementioned ICBG Maya (see Berlin & Berlin, 2004; Nigh, 2002). 81 plants were shipped to the United States to be an alysed by Searle (Greene, 2004: 223) and, after Searle's withdrawal from the project, to the researchers based at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri (Greene, 2004: 219). Yet beneath the language of best institutional actor body considered Comunidades Mara\u00f1on' (OCCAAM -Central of of the Upper Mara\u00f1on). However, after disagreements on the degree of legal protection be 2004: During this time, CAH became more and more outspoken in its opposition to the project, describing OCCAAM as a phantasm: no more than an invention of the research team (Greene, 2004: 216). This is clearly a politically motivated critique, yet its grain of truth is that no more than forty percent of the Aguaruna population were affiliated with OCCAAM; and deceptively, these people were defined as 'the Aguaruna people' in legal proceed Given that the project has not discovered a chemical precursor for a profitable pharmaceutical product, the compensation ultimately paid to Aguaruna communities via OCCAAM has been small. Nonetheless it is easy to picture the 82 political crisis that would have eventuated among Aguaruna people had large sums of been to only those communities affiliated with OCCAAM. This aspect of the story is one of power corrupting: the well -resourced research team appeared willing to act divisively in Aguaruna communities in order to secure the best commercial deal for itself. However, to continue with the epistemological critique the analysis must be focused on the nature of the pharmaceutical research itself. In fact, this insistence on foisiting North American surprising of form it adopts throug h its application via the pharmaceutical industry, was the only theoretical system of medicine and healing around which the ICBG Aguaruna's research was oriented. This is despite the project ostensibly, research about indigenous medicinal knowledge, which would imply an open prospect of encountering healing methodologies. The ICBG initiative screen all plant samples for single -molecule active ingredients by bioassay machines (Hayden, 72). According to George Albers -Sch\u00f6nberg, formerly a chemist with the pharmaceutical corporation Merck, these bioassay machines can only scan botanical samples for already known to in treatment or cure of a disease (1995: 73), such that ethnomedical information can only be used to help guide the decision of what chemical structure to have the bioassay machines scan for. Any pharmaceutical bioprospecting project carried out in th is way is, by blind to the potential synergistic effects between chemical components of an indigenous 83 medicine, as well as to the possibility of completely new biochemical pathways being activated by methods. orientation the co mmercial agreements around the objective of developing a patent on a single -molecular chemical entity and the executive political authority that was required to be able to enter into intellectual property contracts were both instrumentalisations of the kno wledge system of medical science and the pharmaceutical industry. A medicine is not by definition a single -molecular entity. While this is scientifically accepted (e.g. Li & Zhang, 2009), the notion of single -molecule active ingredients remains an operatio nal assumption of Western medicine, a fact which starkly illustrates the distinction between science as a theoretical ideal and science as a social practice. As a further example of this distinction, medical science tends to be prejudiced against research that fails to elucidate the specific chemical pathways of a medicine's bioactivity, even where the effectiveness of a treatment is unquestioned (Swanson, 1995: 11). This delimitation of the focus of biomedical science can only be attributed to a complex we b of social and historical factors. Primary amongst those, however, must be the insinuation of the motives of industrial mass -production into all productive activity, including scientific inquiry. As Evelyn Fox Keller writes in her study of the discipline of molecular biology: [T]he kind of theory that would provide of intellectual economy and technological efficacy. In this way, the very meaning of knowledge -what counts as knowledge -is shaped by a tacit instrumental manda te (1995: 63). 84 In the context of industrial pharmacy, what this means is that it has become an ingrained and and consciously decided - perspective a medicine must be an isolated chemical entity, capabl e of being patented as a unique invention and mass -produced industrially. Medical epistemology has not developed via an assessment of the logic of mass -producing single -entity chemicals, which may then be such as the more severe side effects that by single -entity other have become insinuated into the very meaning of what is and what is not a legitimate medicine. The episte mological consequences of the legal and regulatory structures of industrial political economy are but one example of the inevitable cultural specificities that will inhere in the development of any knowledge system.31 Such cases epistemological inflexibi lity have the capacity to significantly hamper cross - cultural research projects, as the unfolding of the ICBG Aguaruna suggests. In bioassays of the extract of a particular medicinal plant, one of its chemical constituents was found to have antimalarial ac tivity at a rate of 78 percent the two were combined 31 In the modern period in Europe and North America, other prominent examples are the peculiar obsession nationalism (Martin, 1994); and the interplay of the notions of race and hygiene in the colonies of the North -Atlantic powers (Anderson, 2006). 85 in the proportions in which they are naturally found in the medicinal plant's bark, a rate of 90 percent inhibition was demonstrated' (Lewis, 2003: 129). This is unsurprising light of the 'shared sensitivities' between humans and plants to a range of 2003: which implies that the medicinal compounds developed by plants for their own survival are in many cases needed for the very same purpose by new medicines be isolated chemical entities. If not -as in the case of non - labor atory generated plant extracts, which mixture must be isolated and tested individually for safety and efficacy in order to justify its presence in the medicine (Khalil, 1995: 239). The potential of synergistic action is thereby discounted from the beginning, as plant extracts are not tested for efficacy in their original form. Beyond this absence of epistemological dialogue, the subordination of Aguaruna knowledge was even clearer in th e business model followed by Searle. The plant samples collected by the Aguaruna and transferred to Searle were analysed through bioassay machines, with the information collected by the ICBG the samples for chemical substances known to be active against diabetes, cardiovascular problems and inflammatory diseases (Greene, 2004: 219). This was the of marketing drugs to patients suffering from these conditions in the global North, a commercial strategy made all the more unsavoury by the status of these diseases as to extent diseases health problems were rendered irrelevant by this decision. As a final touch, Monsanto (Searle's parent 86 company at that time) included a report on the project as part of its 'Report on Sustainable Development', in which it painted its involvement a for rainforest conservation and the of ingrained, Aguaruna be painted as benefiting enormously from the simple purchase of a cache of plant samples by a multinational corporation. In that globally ruling legal, commercial, te chnical and epistemological level to reduce the products of indigenous knowledge systems to the level of 'genetic supposedly devoid of value property is granted readily to pharmaceutical corporations, even for the most minor of changes to a product's chemical structure (Mgbeoji, 2006: 148), while indigenous knowledge of the medicinal use of a plant is rarely recognised by the same laws of innovation.32 The absence of the affective indicators of high technology indigenous societies tends to of science weaves a narrow epistemological and economic elite. In this strange but familiar world, marginalised 32 In the case of maca (Latin: Lepidium meyenii), a plant native to the northern Peruvian Andes, a patent was granted to a North American company for a simple ethanol extract of the plant, a method k nown and used in traditional medicine in countless locations worldwide (del Castillo, 2004: 27). 87 epistemological frameworks take on the status of stunned spectators/victims. The exclusiveness of Western scientific jargon as an elite cultural signifier, along with Western juridical formalism itself (which has positioned as marginalise indigenous cultures (2006: 149). The point here is not to produce a version of the class -conflict dialectic by demanding for indigenous peoples economy dominated by alien epistemic assumption s to their own, as have the more polemical opponents of 'biopiracy ' (e.g. Mooney, 2000). This case study of the ICBG Aguaruna goes further, pointing to the narrowly industrial -era emphasis on productive efficienc y has infilitrated the social being of science itself, to the extent that it may profoundly alter what could be discovered and added into scientific theories that are presented as elevated, neutral and objective. This conclusion is echoed in the work of Sienna Craig (2011), whose research shows that policy initiatives to develop the medicine standards of cleanliness, purity, and purity set by WHO global in to th has medicines it sought out to understand, it imperative to respond with the proposal of here is not to deny the effectiveness of contemporary western medicine, but to dispute the myth of biomedical epistemology as a neutral set of criteria serving as an arbiter of non -western healing knowledge and practice. Rather, western medicine should be seen as one particular tradition of healing that has reached a high degree of sophistication relative to others, due 88 both to the civilisational continuity and prosperity of the wester n societies which have driven it forward, as well as to the genocide or new therapeutic materials, but also for their conceptual contributions to knowledge about the universal human concerns of health, illness and healing. Culture, Knowledge and the Ontological Turn Case studies such as these help notion that societal structures, including epistemology Yet o f course, the hegemony of western culture has to be presented as beyond culture, because the most fundamental elements of any given culture are presented not as culture but as knowledge about reality. In contemporary western culture, for example, political -economic organisation is dominated by technocratic neoliberal economics, which has great influence on collective behaviour despite its limitations as a knowledge system. Science and technology, particularly biomedicine, stand in a position of greater legi timacy and more strongly reinforce western cultural hegemony. Objectivity indeed, it is the awareness of the haza rds of the subjective position and the subsequent (quixotic) practice of reflexivity and self -critique which appealing to practitioners. Nonetheless, it should be recognised that this belief in the 89 objectivity of science and t echnology, western culture's self -positioning vis -\u00e0-vis 'other to what ideology. It is a definitive characteristic of ideology that it establishes all alternatives as while refusing to accep t any labelling of is ideological pretension of Soviet Marxism 'scientific'. As Slavoj iek puts it, 'the stepping out of (what we experience as) ideology is the very form of our enslavement to it' (1994: 6). In the same way, western culture is not experienced as 'cultural,' because to be a 'culture' within the western sphere is to be categorised in accordance with a history of colonialism, subjection and marginalisation, and attendant upon this cate a scrutiny from which the dominant rational discourses (and their institutions) are spared. If we perceive western knowledge as itself cultural, it becomes impossible to practise anthropology on the basis of a conceptualisation as one particular, limited manner of taking account of the properties of the natural world as we have established them (Descola, 2013a). Consequently, in place of culture and nature, culture should seen as ontological in the sense of incorporating ontology. That is to say, a people's culture includes their understanding of the basic nature of (ontology), what Philippe Descola calls 'the manner of (20 13b: 66); and the means by which legitimate knowledge about that reality can be acquired (epistemology). State interculturality, therefore, must pay special the health -seeking preferences of Shuar people in Zamora - Chinchipe, this thesis will thus focus on various health practices encountered. I contend that it is in the experence of health crises 90 that fundamental ontological commitments are revealed; and also that the failure healing practices such moments of turn' has been put forward as an explicit response to the crisis of confidence in anthropological research that followed Clifford and Marcus's (1986) is to be uch more efficaciously shattered by means of the ethnographic description of a countermetaphysics than by the internal which western institutions risks producing a sense of alienation from its theories for the innumerable people around the world who perceive benefits in their engagements with certain products and cultural forms originating in western society.33 It is far more productive to see western knowledge as one particular, valuable situated knowledge to be compared with the situated knowledges that have evolved in other places. Within this of reference, socio experiences of distinct groups of people. As we shall see in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, the de facto , non -state -led intercultural health practice of Shuar people validates the argument of Casper Jensen are never 33 The same schism between the position of anthropologists and of indigenous people in fact also (see Chapter 7). 91 hermetically sealed but always part of multiple engagements. They offer not only discursive or conceptual but also practical commentary and critique of other realities' (2012: 366). The analysis presented in this the existing literature the mechanics of change in indigenous metaphysics to the varying effects of colonial difference e xpressed through economics, religion and discourse. In conclusion, the epistemological critique and the conceptualisation of western epistemology as one particular form of situated knowledge is fundamental to the project of state interculturality. Without it, the various epistemological that make up the political and intellectual hegemony of liberal mu lticulturalism. As this thesis explores interculturality through the the healthcare, this chapter has laid out at length a critique of biomedical epistemology and its implication with the particularities of the socio -historic al experience of the Euro -American world. In light of this critique, and the evidence provided of an encounter between the ruling relations of biomedicine the impos sible to the idea that intercultural health can be satisfactorily constructed through the existing institutions of public health built on the western model, as preceding critiques of state interculturality have already suggested (e.g. research project documenting the health -seeking preferences of Shuar people across severa l distinct sites within the Shuar territory of a single Ecuadorian provice is 92 situated within the goals expressed by epistemic practices' 2007: with Shuar people about thei r actions in moments of health crisis, both their most fundamental ontological presumptions and their conversion to ontological postulates that differ from those found within the Shuar tradition are made visible. This fact suggests that the prospects for s tate interculturality will be both dependent on and riven by the kinds of interactions and conflicts between the ontologies in question in any one context in which indigenous actors might seek to finally make state appear that addressing politics of ontology will be to the interculturality.

All data was collected during in communally Shuar territory in of Zamora -Chinchipe from May 2013 until September 2014. In total, 64 Shuar people were interviewed.

For I estimate the total Shuar population of Zamora -Chinchipe to be approximately 12,000. This is based on the 2010 census, in which 79,709 people 94 identified as Shuar , discussions with federation leaders and other sources (e.g. El Tel\u00e9grafo, 2011) which suggest that approximately two -thirds of Ecuadorian Shuar l ive in Morona -Santiago province, with the rest split between Zamora -Chinchipe other Amazonian provin undermined by the fact that a man's power was seen to be simply 'based on a combination of personal prestige and the capacity to manipulate vast works of alliance' (Taylor, 1981: 655). Households occasionally formed small clusters in the more productive riverine territory, but tended to be widely separated the today took place through the engagement with missionaries, along with the simultaneous pressure from colonists from the Ecuadorian highlands, especially from the 1960s. The Shuar of the contemporary province of Za mora -Chinchipe were exposed to Spanish colonialism early, with the original settlement of Zamora (some 65km down -river from where the city lies today) founded in the mid -sixteenth century because of the presence of gold. At the close of the century, howeve r, an organised indigenous uprising destroyed all This historical event gave rise to the legend that the Spanish governor of the town of Sevilla de Oro was killed by his Shuar captors when they forced him to drink molten gold to satisfy his greed (Padilla, 2012: 62, 89). The 95 Shuar people were then left alone by Ecuadorian society for three centuries, buttressed by a reputation for savagery that grew from this history as well as the ancestral practice of shrinking h eads. In 1888, the Ecuadorian Amazon was divided into 'Vicariatos founded a miss ion at the present -day site of Zamora and then another nearby at Yacuambi34 in 1893, while the Salesians urned out to be short -lived. The Yacuambi mission was abandoned the following year due to an outbreak of malaria; one Franciscan reported, without irony, that the Indians' stupid, shamelessly d introduced disease' (Izaguirre, 1978: 238 -9). The Zamora mission, meanwhile, was abandoned in 1897. This decision could be tied to the beginnings of Ecuador's Liberal Revolution in 1895, with the concomitant collapse in mission financing, although ju st as significant was likely the fact that the Franciscans had not managed to attract any to become more significant to the Ecuadorian state in the twentieth century. The colonisation of the Amazon served as a sort of pressure valve to defuse social conflicts around land ownership in the highlands (Salazar, 1981: 593), particularly after the 1964 dissolution of the 34 San Jos\u00e9 de Yacuambi is officially known as 28 de mayo and appears Figure 1 as such. 35 Their ethnocentrism significant the that the Shuar 'violate the most obvious precepts of natural law daily and with impunity'; and that their 'essential character ' was one of 'indifference, disdain and the ingratitude' 263), along methods (Ortiz Crespo, 1992: 96). The missionaries themselves encouraged dreams of agricultural bounty in the Amazon, present ed as 'virgin lands of prodigious those for export, like coffee, cocao, coca, etc., which are so consumed in the Old (Bottasso, 2011: 30 ward off furthe r territorial annexations by Peru after the 1941 war. The missionaries' role in 'pacifying' the Shuar therefore received central a decree granted them direct financial assistance, tax -free status, d uty-free imports and free cargo transport from the military in exchange for the obligation to 'civilise and indoctrinate the savage tribes' (Salazar, 1981: 605). The Franciscans had returned to re -found their Zamora mission in 1921, then went on to found m issions at Yacuambi (1936), Guadalupe (1951), Yantzaza (1963), Zumbi (1964), became hubs of social organisatio n connecting Shuar territory into the political -economic Ecuadorian society. As a colonizers organised by a para -state entity (The Centre for the Economic Transformation of the South [CREA]), nearly all Amazon ian towns were born as mission residences among indigenous people, and within a few decades transformed into settlements of highland mestizos. The 97 indigenous people of the area [...] end up going there sporadically for petty commerce at the markets, or for h ealth problems (Bottasso, 2011: 36 -37). This brief sketch helps visualise the history of the Shuar 'centros' of Kiim (7km from Guadalupe) and of Yanua and Churubia, located about 20km from both El Pangui the south and Bomboiza (formerly a Salesian m the Indians' (19 99: 219). They afforded access but also spread epidemic disease. One middle the Yacuambi River Valley said, 'With measles, so many access goods such as pots, machetes and fish -hooks which came to be regarded as essential. According to Taylor, such marginalised from the nascent market economy (Taylor, 1981: 660 -2). At the same time, the missions effected a dramatic intervention on Shuar society via the system, a central item of missionising strategy. Initially, of children for both Salesian and Franciscan misionaries. Until a few years ago, at least in the case of the Fransciscan mission, the usua l procedure was kidnapping' (Salazar, 1981: 592), a practice permitted the missionaries due to the backing of the police and army. In more recent decades, however, 98 Shuar parents began boarding schools, perceiving 'the putative profitability of association with the spheres of white power' (Taylor, 1981: 660), in particular the profitability of developing the ability to speak Spanish. From a situation where the Shuar of Zamora -Chinchipe were their lands from missions, a convergence of factors in the 1960s and 70s to permanent missions, the schools and forced labour, being adoption of the principle of divine incarnation -which holds that God has always been present in in native the missions' official tutelage over Shuar lands in 1969. In anticipation, in 1964 the Salesians facilitated the foundation of the 'Federaci\u00f3n Interprovincial de Centros Shuar' (Interprovincial Federation of Shuar Centres structure that empowered Shuar members. For example, the system of radio schooling set up by the Federation was institutionalised as 'fisco -misi onal' rather than public so as to keep the schools under the control of the missionaries instead of the state, reportedly 36 Despite receiving state funds for their schooling, the missions obliged Shuar children to work six days per week, ostensively to produce the food consumed on t he missions. The degree to which the missions profited from child labour is contentious. Ernesto Salazar has argued: '[A] fact that cannot be overlooked is that the religious mission in general has degenerated from a Christian religious enterprise into a C hristian economic one' (1981: 592). Shuar accounts to ethnographer Steven Rubenstein were that their time on the missions was one of 'slavery' (2001: 272). 99 against the wishes of Shuar Federation leaders (Salazar, 1981: 594, 604 -5). Nonetheless, as one of the first indigenous federations in the world, the FISCH colonisation also provided the legal framework throu gh which Shuar people could claim title to the land they currently occupied. From the CREA and R eform and Colonisation (IERAC). At Federation, IERAC also worked to demarcate and organised as the collective property of the 'centros', which were the base administrative unit of the Feder ation, rather than of individual families, in order to speed up the process via single, large titles. Importantly, ownership of land was taken on by Shuar 'centros' as cooperatives, and not under a policy of indigenous land recognition per se, with the pro viso that individuals could only sell land to others within the 'centro'. At the same time, FISCH channeled development aid to initiate a program of loans to Shuar 'centros' for the to IERAC policy that land could be reclaimed if it did not produce for five consecutive years, a measure directed at the great hereditary estates of the highlands, but one entirely unsuitable to the ecological parameters of t he rainforest and heedless of the ancestral practice of swidden agriculture (Descola, 1981: 641; Salazar, 1981: 602). colonisation, the Shuar 'centros' appropriated colonisation's juridical tools in order to secure their own recognition. For these reasons, most Shuar people today live in small nucleated settlements, typically centred around a 100 chapel or volleyball pitch, surrounded by communally titled territory that is apportioned within the 'centro' who work their 'centro' Kiim in 2013, seen from across the Yacuambi River, with its chapel in the centre Such a schematic history should not allow us to forget human The leaders responsible for managing the legalisation of 'centros' in both the Quimi River Valley and the Upper Nangaritza Valley both related stories to me of violent confrontations with mestizos and a hostile atmosphere outside their this its relative geographical isolation, Shuar territory in Nangaritza was only legalised in the first decade of this century. I e ncountered families in 101 Nangaritza whose grandparents had come to the area fleeing mestizo colonization along the Quimi River. Then while staying in Shuar towns in the Quimi River Valley months later, an elderly couple experience of uadorian colonists as follows: Emiliano - There were miners first. They came along the Zamora River [digging for gold]. My grandfather and uncle fought, and were sent running. They had to hide, and after that they wouldn't talk with anyone. Daniela - Whe n the Christians came we had to run like agoutis. Emiliano - But first, they would come and talk, asking for chicha and cassava. Daniela - They wanted to drink chicha. That's why they came. Then they started to rob chooks and pigs, carrying off whatever they could. That's when people became afraid. Emiliano - They had to hide. The colonisers would carry off chicha and maize, chooks and pigs. Q - And were the colonisers armed? Emiliano - Of course. Daniela - That's why our grandparents were afraid. They c ame to start fights and even kill. Product of the harsh reality of violence and the shock of epidemic disease, the intergenerational memory of middle -aged and elderly Shuar people is coloured by the experience of social dislocation common to indigenous shoes, nor blankets, nor baskets, nothing. Now people have everything. the little ones wear shoes. They're practically wearing shoes while We were survivo rs. We didn't even have salt to eat with our cassava.' In a similar vein, her husband Emiliano recounted, 'When I was young, I had nothing. It was suffering. When I was as big as him [indicating a grandson], we had nothing, nothing. We slept on the ground. I had rags for blankets.' This depiction contrasts 102 markedly with what Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine Taylor found in much more remote Jivaroan households in the late 1970s, which at this stage was mostly autonomous from Ecuadorian society: men, of elder generation in Zamora -Chinchipe and the lifeways encountered by Descola and Taylor around the same time but in a more remote region speaks to the widespread disruption of autochthonous the of social units in the province in the latter half of the twent ieth century. Though the legal borders of Shuar territory have stabilished, the conflict itself has not been superseded. In November 2016, a group of armed Shuar men occupied a mining camp in Morona -Santiago and expelled at gunpoint, before to flee when the central government declared martial law. The camp is being run by the same Chinese company that operates the Mirador gold and copper mine in the Quimi River Valley (El Comercio, 2016). In a similar vein, a Shuar man living on th e Quimi told me that several years ago, he confronted mestizos grazing cattle on land claimed by his family in the upper part of the valley and forced them at gunpoint to return to the nearest town. A few months after I finished up my research in 2014, the man was found murdered in a case that remains unsolved. The man was also a vocal opponent of the Mirador mine. 103 Figure 3: Disputed land in the Upper Quimi River Valley in 2014 Around the same time, a 'white' family in the provincial city of Macas, so me 275km to the north of Zamora -Chinchipe, described to me in horrified tones the robbery of their son by two Shuar men at knifepoint. When asked whether the attackers police, they replied, 'They fled off into the jungle. How are we going to pursue them there?' Though hysterical in giving the false impression of being hemmed in by impenetrable forest, it is true that communally -titled land is difficult to navigate without the requisite local knowledge and connections and that the p resence of police on such land is highly contentious. Among Shuar people, the impression is widespread that the police represent mestizo society. Likewise, as illustrated by the fate of the man from the Quimi River Valley, the protection afforded to Shuar people by the forces of law and order 104 is only partial, for both geographic and historical reasons. Although a discontinuous patchwork, the sense of a frontier between Shuar territory and the rest of Ecuador ian society is therefore very real. Once, seeing a campaign poster for the then President Rafael Correa while walking in a Shuar town, I asked a primary school -aged child who had taken to following me around if he knew who the man in the picture was. 'Cor rea,' he replied. Wondering if he knew that Correa the president, I asked, 'What is his occupation?' 'Killing,' the -2015, that the Shuar heartl and of Morona -Santiago. The imaginary frontier between mestizo society and the jungle was punctured by Shuar protesters who overran riot police and besieged government offices in the provincial capital Macas for police initially tried to clear protesters their shields and they were battered back themselves by Shuar men wielding ten -foot spears. At other times, the potential for conflict is belied by the coexistence between and well Shuar co mmunity leaders and bilingual education system schoolteachers who do business in the urban world; as well as between the young people of all stripes who mix in the provincial cities in search of fun, work and money.

As such, the way in which data precedes analysis in the sequencing of these chapters can be seen to mirror the order in which these patterns came to my own attention. The idea is, above all, to avoid the pseudo style from informants selected by the author at will, like a succession of rabbits pulled out of a hat.

As such, interviewees with whom I did not already have a relationship wer e perhaps guarded in personal familiarity and shamanic practice. 110 Responses to this question differed to a similar extent as responses about use of biomedical services. While 62 percent of residents of remote Shuar tow ns consult another 20.7 percent refused to percent miners would do so. of the validity of shamans was just as great, with 80 percent saying they would never seek treatment from them.

It has become somewhat of an axiom in the literature of medical anthropology and international public health that the shaman represents a figure who mediates society's interactions with 'the sup ernatural' - or worlds beyond the immediately visible material reality -and is responsible for the cohesion of society when faced with the inexplicable (e.g. Scheper -Hughes, 1987: 16). As was one hand; shamanism, on other, as encapsulating the true profundity of cosmology and its of shamanism, the expectation is an individual marked out and set aside from his or her society. By virtue of dedicated adolescent rites, social isolation, the inheritance of certain attribut es through family, or serendipitous events in the individual's life (Eliade, 1975: 76), the shaman becomes singularly adept at navigating the phenomenal experience of other worlds and guiding his or her otherwise na\u00efve fellow human beings through the same experience. What emerged in these interviews, by contrast, is that in Shuar society the experience of visions during altered states of consciousness does not of a shaman. Rather, such practices are managed at the level of the ind ividual, or the nuclear family. For his or her part, the shaman is considered adept at leveraging such states in order to and then potentially carry out a cure, depending on how he or she perceives the nature of the illness. This distinc tion between the role of the shaman as an essential mediator with the supernatural and the Shuar context -a sort of democratic, plant -inspired religiosity according to which any Shuar individual can access perceptions of a reality beyond that which is ordin arily visible -is by no means unknown to specialists 314; Rubenstein, noteworthy here in bringing a further degree of complexity to this pictur e of Shuar health -seeking practices, which are enriched not just by clinical medicine and a traditional medicine all too readily divided between the material as herbalism and the spiritual as shamanism. For contemporary Shuar people, the latter 112 category in not only the specialist also towards a complex of ideals including personal development, learning and socialisation (see Chapter 4), all of which associate health in to 58.6 percent of them, to be specific, with another 31 percent giving mixed or qualified responses. As will be detailed in Chapter 4, the way they expressed their ideas demonstrated a clear genealogy with the descriptions of psychedelic vision and the Ar\u00fatam complex of beliefs pieced to gether by Michael Harner (1972) from his experiences living among Shuar people some 60 years ago. It is this persistence of the ontology (and relatedly, the epistemology) indigenous to this territory that is one of the most marked features of intracultural diversity mainly though stories as well as, on occasion, their own halting experimentation, were not im portant to them and did not inform their altered states of consciousness for their understanding of health and heal ing. This number was surprisingly high in comparison with the group's rejection of both vision -inducing plants, which they tend to refer to as 'drugs,' as well as of shamanism as a legitimate practice. In their responses, one can see how this attachment to visions, historically sanctioned in Shuar society as transformed residents remote and Evangelicals will be the subject of Chapters 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Lastly, Chapter 7 will tackle the influence of the common themes of the discourse of the indigenous cultural -revivalist political party Pachakutik on the way Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe think about and express themselves on the subject of healthcare and traditional medicine. In a form of Chinese whispers, many interv iewees had developed the idea that the 'gringo' researcher staying in their town had come to carry research on 'nuestra medicina ancestral' ('our ancestral medicine'). Although the actual objectives of the research in developing a portrait of Shuar hea lth-seeking preferences in the province for the purpose of intercultural health were always explained at the commencement of interviews, this sense that interviewees were expected to speak about, flaunt their knowledge and rituals associated with traditional medicine have been instrumental in legitimising claims to indigeneity elsewhere in the region (e.g. Jackson & Ram\u00edrez, 20 09: 536). As the research process unfolded and the pattern repeated, politically -loaded aspect to discussions of traditional medicine had to be made an explicit part of the study. The aim here is not to weed out 'political bia s' from interviewees' and the worldview which informs them. Instead, the idea is to consider this political discourse as but one example of a develop of PK discourse and use medicinal plants 17 (81%) 26 (68%) ... and use clinics 14 (67%) 29 (76%) ... and use shamans 11 (52%) 20 (53%) ... and use visionary practice 10 (48%) 18 (47%) Total 21 (100%) 38 (100%) On a methodological note, the number of people cited as influenced by discourse can be considered an underestimate, if anything; because there was no way reliably prompt this aspect of the responses without biasing them, and because in any case it was not a factor that I had originally intended to consider, only those interviewees who dem onstrated this way of thinking during the interview of their own accord could be included. As such, the study actually measures the number of people who make use of PK discourse in their self -expression, rather than the number of people whose thinking may have been influenced by the discourse. Having said that, there is no reason to suspect that this would prejudice the figures in a relative sense for any particular subset of the interviewee cohort. 115 As for the figures themselves, the most immediately striki ng element is the similarity in health -seeking behaviour between interviewees who expressed themselves in the terms of PK discourse and those who did not. Indeed, with regard to recourse to slightly higher proportion of the non -PK discourse group were willing to make use of clinical medicine; this shows that the few interviewees who rejected clinical medicine outright tended to express their ideas by making use of themes of indigenous cultural revival and resistance to colonisation. The greatest difference (13 percent) was in use of medicinal plants, which are such an emblematic aspect of indigenous traditional medicine and non -western cultural expression as a whole. Even so, the difference was far from stark, such that we might tentatively conclude that causative impact on the health 8 (27.5%) 2 (7%) PK-affiliated 11 (33%) 20 (61%) 2 (6%) Non -PK-affiliated 'centros' 10 (36%) 17 (61%) 1 (3%) Waged miners 3 (25%) 9 (75%) 0 All miners 4 (24%) 13 (76%) 0 Evangelicals 4 (40%) 6 (60%) 0 All 21 (34%) 37 (61%) 3 (5%) 116 A further surprising element emerges when the presence of PK discourse in interviewee responses is correlated with (geographic, economic, already mentioned, as well as with the political the Shuar centres of w hich each interviewee a member. The most striking fact be observed here is the proportion interviewees in themes nearly identical to the proportion who expressed themselves in that way in communities not affiliated with Pachakutik. Just a third of interviewees PK -affiliated towns discussed their health practices the figure was actually slightly higher, at 35.7 percent. One can only come to the curious conclusion that the politi cal affiliation of Shuar communities has no independent influence on the way in which interviewees think and speak about health, medicine and illness. employed at the Mirador project) as its salient political position vis -\u00e0-vis Shuar people in the province of Zamora s o the problem cannot be reduced to that of a marginal party without a sufficient platform to make its view known. As such it is difficult to comprehend the degree of 117 correspondence between Pachakutik's member communities and the language and way of thinking associated with the party. Likewise, Shuar people's position vis -\u00e0-vis the economic ideology of Pachakutik shows no relationship with whether or not their perspective on health and illness and associated worldview is in alignment with and expressed through the themes common to Pachakutik's discourse. In other words, Shuar people who think and speak in the same terms as Pachakutik are less likely to be on mining ('extractivism', in the terms of Pachakutik). This rai ses the question as to the consistency of Pachakutik's political position against industrial -scale mining versus so -called 'artisan' mining with the rest of their discourse, at least for Shuar people, who do not appear to see a necessary contradiction betw een working in the mining sector and the desirability of maintaining their cultural independence. After all, pre - and early -colonial history suggests that there is no inherent incongruence between economic large 1994: 36 -38). However, before delving into interpretation, it is time to first give colour to these statistics in the form of some examples of the common types of response offered to the a bove listed questions by Shuar people of the distinct subsets so far. The Discourse of Indigeneity in Interviewee Responses The Pachakutik political party was founded in 1995 as the electoral wing of Ecuador's largest indigenous federation, CONA IE, as a means of channelling the support manifest in the 1990 national -level indigenous uprisings, considered landmarks in Ecuadorian 118 political history. the confirmation of the 2008 Constitution, Pachakutik 'plurinational' and 'intercultural' character of the Ecuadorian state. The party has since become opposed to Alianza Pa\u00ed where the government has supported large -scale development of agriculture and generally large -scale mining and oil projects of often invoked in fiery affirmation of indigenous identity, long d erided in Ecuador, pre -elections event are less 'rallies' or 'demonstrations' as much as are scenes of dancing and drinking to traditional styles of music which, especially in isolated areas, can turn into the biggest parties around. 119 Figure 4 : Nangaritza Shuar travelling to a pre -election Pachakutik rally in 2014 It has to be said, however, that while Pachakutik is in effect 'the no means monopolises indigenous electoral support. Although the party controls the provincial government in Zamora -Chinchipe, the Correa government won a greater share than Pachakutik of the vote in most indigenous -majority areas across the country in the 2013 presidential and legislative elections (S\u00e1nchez Parga, 2013). As this present research makes clear, the common cultural inheritance shared by members of indigenous groups and affirmed by the Pachakutik party is just one aspect of indigenous individuals' worldviews and political stances, which in ways.

When the then President stepped down in 2013, his wife became the organisation's Vice -President. Having said that, the PK -linked themes that were so central t o interviewees' when they demonstrated one of a few attributes. This discourse is characterised by the theme of indigenous cultural revival, and this can take the form of an invocation of an idealised past prior to colonial contact, the denigration of the ways of life brought by that contact, and often both elements together. Shuar people often illustrate their perc of present - day corruption and decay in indigenous society via comparison with the ways of life of their ancestors; or just as often, with the state of other Amazonian peoples living in more remote regions: usually the Achuar, or the Jivaroan groups living on the other side of Zamora -Chinchipe's border with Peru (composed of the Shuar, Aguaruna ['awajunes'] and Huambisa ['wampis'] peoples), area much more centres 121 of political -economy gravity than Zamora -Chinchipe is fr om those in Ecuador. The point is not that these interviewees simply valued by an idealisation of pre -contact society shared with an influential, nation -wide political discourse. The meme of historical revival is especially striking in light of the lack of importance attributed to history by Jivaroan peoples noted Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine Taylor, ethnographers who some fo rty years ago conducted research approximately 300km to the north of my own research area and within the same linguistic family, reported '[t]he remarkable indifference that the Achuar the [...] they get along very well without a histori cal memory, all recall of events that affected their spontaneous north -west of the internationalisa tion of indigenous rights discourse and its permeation -as the present study makes clear -of even some the indigenous territories (see also Jackson, 1994; Ramos, 1994). In its Ecuadorian permutation, this discourse is shaped b y primarily Kichwa assumptions, manifest in aspects as well to the a health worldview of Shuar individuals will be explored in Chapter 7. 122 PK discourse was easily notable in the interviews because of its ostensibly tangential nature, as well uniformity of the theme. For example, when asked about the kind of treatment given by a Shuar healer who treated and cured her sick son, a Kiim woman said, 'We gave him only natural medicines, all the medicines that we cultivate as our culture.' She later imes they say that the baby needs calcium or other things so they can grow up healthy, but we don't use this, we just give them natural medicines. We put chinni on the [baby's] knees to make them strengthen. Nowadays, when the baby is sick they say, \"Let's go to the 'subcentro' (clinic).\" Before, we used to make a herbal wash for the child and give medications to clean out their stomach. We're rescuing these customs. From this perspective, Shuar people are seen to be turning more towards clinical medicine (and other aspects of the outside world) not due to its intrinsic merits, but rather because of their own a dozen medicinal plants that she uses, '[s]ome people go to the doctor even just for a stomach pain.' This misguidedness is considered to impact upon health a broader sense than just the choice of medicines. As I was told by one of the two sisters : I use ginger when I cook meat or chicken. It's better than using dressings for flavour. We don't know what kind of garbage they put in those bottles. I always say, 'In the countryside we have all the food we need, because God has provided it for us.' Bu t the great laziness that we suffer from, the great laziness that kills us, is running to the store. Running to the store, instead of spending a little time on your land, and giving your children the food they need. The respect for traditional indigenous p ractices is coupled with a disdain for what comes from the outside world, and its impact upon Shuar people's health. 123 My mother -in-law says that the air and the water is much more contaminated now than it used to be, and that's why there is so much illness . Before they used to live without illness. Now even the plants are different. They put in chemicals to improve the production, so it's not what it used to be. We work here without using chemicals. We just work, using our own strength we produce something healthy to feed to our children. While PK discourse was particularly marked in Kiim, similar styles of commentary on the state of health Shuar were forthcoming from PK -affiliated community leaders and its surrounds. \u00d3scar Taish, who in 2014 ran on the Pachakutik ticket for an elected position on the council of a small Nangaritza municipality, said, 'We eat pasta, rice, tinned meat, and it produces illnesses. And for us this is quite worrying, are well -founded -it has to be remembered that the western -style food that does reach these remote areas tends to be very high in salt or sugar used as preservatives -and this perhaps towns. Ricardo Kayuk Yanua in Quimi Valley, for example, began on the subject of traditional medicine by praising the knowledge of his forefathers, before lamenting the practices of people toda y. 'We have to eat rice,' he said. 'And they are just swollen up with lots of chemicals, and then make a stew. That's why we are so sick all the time , with all the sicknesses that there are. We consume so much sugar as well.' A final aspect of Pachakutik discourse of practices to Shuar people as part of 'culture.' An exampl e was a teacher in the formerly -controlled Directorate of Bilingual to a question about whether he would teach his 124 knowledge of medicinal plants to his children by saying, 'Now, currently, because education has been advancing, the not place much importance on culture.' The implication is that students are somehow escaping from what is cultural in being taught a certain set of (non -Shuar) of one's own instead of seeing it as a self -evident enactment of knowledge. While a degree of self -reflexivity is inevitable in any engagement with the outside, the notion of 'culture' in modern western ontology sets up a dangerous asymm etry between a peculiarity to be examined and assessed, on one side; and on the other, a set of universals exempt from the same scrutiny. Philippe Descola sums up its implications as follows: we do not complet e systems of cosmology and epistemology. As Roy Wagner puts it, anthropologists working with the nature/culture division as an assumption do not consider that culture or offer counter -examples t o it, as a total system of conceptualization; but rather, invite comparison as \"other ways\" of dealing we are to comprehend s tate healthcare and indigenous health -seeking practice in the context of Pachakutik and the broader discourse of indigenous culture. What are the contradictions of advocating for intercultural health via the notion of cultural rights? How can Pachakutik face these contradictions as a party operating within an international framework of indigenous rights? What language and processes can the Ecuadorian state adopt if it seeks 37 The citation of Wagner is drawn from The Invention of Culture (1981: 142). 125 to build healthcare as a the 'intercultural and plurinational is responsive the worldview its citizens, whoever they may be? Before these questions can be answered, however, we have to begin to understand the nature of Shuar health - seeking practices and the intracultural diversity expressions. Health Practices of Shuar Evangelicals The position of twenty -first century Shuar people can be characterised as one of partial conquest, and this is reflected in their religious convictions. Like the majority of Ecuadorians, most Shuar met consider themselves Yet their Catholicism tends to syncretic to a point would scandalise most of the world's God -fearing Christians. One suspects that it is an open question as to who was being converted more between the Shuar and the pioneering Franciscans. Contrary to the stereotype of fanatics brimstone to pagan worship, other option. In a essay, James Boster (2003) shows that indigenous notion of Ar\u00fat am was transposed by missionaries to their own notion of God as if the two were equivalent. Missionaries taught that the diverse figures from Shuar mythology were 'hypostases' of the Holy Spirit (Boster, 2003: 170 -1), and that the visions they fasting, hiking to of God. This was the perspective held by a mission -educated Shuar man in Nangaritza who in 2014 told me, 'Ar\u00fatam is God himself. T here's no way to draw distinctions between them. In Shuar, it's 126 Ar\u00fatam and in Spanish it's God.' This perception of equivalence the people' (quoted in Boster, 2003: 170). Shuar Catholics, then, are a people half - converted: they see murder and polygamy as evidence of sin instead of strength, but have no moral compunction against Evangelism first entered this milieu with the founding of the Gospel Missionary Union mission at Makuma, Morona -Santiago in 1976. since spread throughout via interfamilial connections, i ts ardent adherents working fervour but marginal impact. Their is grounded in a 'midwestern and southern fundamentalism' (Taylor, 1981: 669) that prohibits followers from involvement in any kind of 'drunkenness,' which interpreted to include the effects of ayahuasca, datura, tobacco and chicha, as as the beer and 'aguardiente' (sugar -cane liquor) obtained plants wo rldview in light of the uniformity of responses from the interviewees, which was greater for this group than for any other. With regard to the Evangelical cohort, there was a total of ten interviewees, seeven of whom lived in whom lived in Churubia in the Quimi 127 most distinctive features of shamans to consume these plants; and a general pragmatism between respect for herbal medicine and a willingness to seek out treatments at medical clinics. Table Prefer clinical to herbal medicine? 5 (50%) 2 (20%) 3 (30%) Use of or trust in shamanic treatments? 0 9 (90%) 1 (10%) Attach importance to (Evangelical) visionary practices? 3 (30%) 7 (70%) 0 Use of or trust in psychoactive plants? 0 9 (90%) 1 (10%) Of the three interviewees from the Quimi River Valley, the two men claimed to know nothing specific about medicinal plants and their uses. The third lamented, in our interview, that she had not been taught about medicinal plants by her parents; she said that both for serious illnesses or injuries and for everyday fevers and colds suffered by her children, the nearby clinic in the town of Tundayme was her first resort. By the same token, she had evidently developed a degree of knowledge on the subject of m edicinal plants on 128 an ad hoc basis. She described, for example, using a certain plant to stem the bleeding when her brother was seriously wounded. She also gave scrapings of datura to a friend who had returned from hospital after being treated for a broken bone, but was still suffering from the pain and swelling caused by her injury. Regardless of the degree of knowledge they possessed on the subject, eight of the nine Evangelicals interviewed agreed on of opinions ninth, an elderly man from Churubia, were difficult to gauge, as he considered medicinal plants the terrain of women. The rejection of shamans and the hallucinogenic plants that are the visionary tools of the shamans' trade (but also have a social life outside of shamanism and healing) was the Evangelical group's strongest predilection. Where many other Shuar people noted the value they place on the visionary experience obtained via ayahuasca, datura and tobacco, all of the Evangelical men except two specifically commented that they no longer consume these plants since their conversion to the Evangelical sect. One of the other men was notably hesitant finally denying that he before conve Evangelism. The second offered only a short interview that did not touch upon the matter; he was intimidated by the interview process and seemed to have a limited capacity to express himself. The power of religious conversion to wipe out tradition al vision -seeking practice seems to be present even in the case of those raised in a traditional Shuar manner. This became clear when interviewing the old man who was the head of the family in Churubia. When pressed about why he had drunk ayahuasca and dat ura, he replied: 129 My grandfather used to give it to me, to make me strong, make me grow up, make me a man. That's why the old ones would give it [...] I drank it as part of our custom, to make you live well and for a long time. I don't drink it now that I'm drunk, 'emborracha fe\u00edsimo.' Getting drunk is a sin, they say. a middle -aged Evangelical Shuar preacher visiting Shaime during my time there said, 'I remember that before, before I left this behind, I used t o drink nat\u00e9m . We drank it in order to receive strength, and to encounter a vision so that we would be able to keep on living for a long time.' Another described the multiple times he drank ayahuasca each There one sees visions, the vision that one may see, of one's home, of gaining more experience and knowledge from a age.' When whether he he replied, 'Well, learning t he word of God one has to leave these things, these demonic things.' This is not a case, then, of Evangelical norms slowly eroding away any specific and aggressive normative clash in which the Evangelical side has gained traction among some Shuar in the region. That is not to say that Evangelicals were willing to deny or belittle the importance of during of or more broadly. The preache r described his conversion experience as a vision of being healed by angels while in a delirium brought on by illness; likewise, the Evangelical grandmother said that God could visit the faithful in dreams to heal them. As will be discussed in Chapter 5, E vangelisation brings not an abandonment of Shuar people's attachment to the significance of invisible realities, but rather a modulation of its rules of engagement and a changed dynamic of spiritual hierarchy and subjugation. 130 Of the four Evangelical women , three of them excoriated the practice of drinking hallucinogenic The fourth simply had no exposure to such plants in her youth and did not mention any desire to try them. Only one of the women admitted to previous experiences with the plants befo based on her A lesser prevalence of use of hallucinogenic plants among Shuar women -or a lesser desire to having had the experience -is consistent with the notion a male prerogative' (2014: 97). In light of this, and in a society like that of Shuar people, without formalised clans, religious rules or ritual structures, it is logical emblematic rite of passage would be more commonly foisted upon young men than on young women. Only one of the Evangelicals (the Shaime man who was most reticent in expressing his ideas) would go to a shaman for treatment. The two brothers following the Evangelical faith described shamans a Devil.' Both also emphasised the idea that shamans lie about their ability to heal in order to deceive people into paying them extortionate sums for treatment. In fact, for it was perhaps less the scriptural proh ibitions and moreso the direct experience of being deceived by charlatans that was the more operative in their religious conversions, as the daughter of one of the men died despite her father pouring time and resources into her receiving treatments from various shamans. Put another way, one could say that it was this life experience which allowed the Evangelical norms to resonate with these men. The preacher, by made little reference to personal experience, simply shamans in conceptual terms as 'an abomination.' He also said that the ayahuasca experience is to be condemned because its hallucinations are 'a Satanic old man described shamans as 'liars,' and the other two said that visiting shamans is 'prohibited.' 131 On a final point, the preference held by Evangelicals between clinical medicine and herbal - plant treatments -their only alternative treatment option due to the generalised rejection of shamanism -was mixed. For the three residents of Churubia, despite some amateur knowledge about medicinal plants, clinical medicine was clearly their primary remedy however, there to clinics among of serums are used by medical personnel (and on a more general level, the state) to kill off indigenous people. He contrasted clinical and hospital care harshly with tra ditional lifeways a style reminiscent of the cultural revivalist discourse characteristic of the Pachakutik party. Others were happy to vacillate in their preference between clinical and herbal medicine. One Shaime man criticised pharmaceuticals for bei ng 'chemical' and 'sedatives,' but admitted to using them in certain cases. For him, whatever the medicine, the key element was prayer and faith in God. The grandmother made a similar point, use with prayer, fasting, faith and correct moral conduct. As for the Evangelical and his wife, they commented that they trusted clinical medicine and had seen good results with it. Two of t heir four children had been born in hospital, which is rare among residents of the region. Finally, the former 'magia' Evangelical asked for a preference between clinical and herbal medicine. 132 Geographic Isolation and Traditional Ontology in Shuar Healing In the case of the province of Zamora -Chinchipe, to speak of Shuar living in remote areas is to speak of the Upper Nangaritza River Basin. While there are communally -titled Shuar settlements sur prisingly close to regional cities, Alto Nangaritza is the one area of the province where Shuar settlement predominates. To the gringo in learning about 'Shuar culture', mestizo townspeople in Zamora were quick to urge a trip to Nangaritza: 'all\u00e1 es puro Shuar' ('It's 100% Shuar there'). At one notices a of compatriots Ecuadorians, especially in the Oriente (the eastern, rainforested half of Ecuador). It is not unusual to hear sentiments similar to those of the Zamora resident who told me about the Nangaritza Shuar, 'They are very racist. They don't being turned into a shrunken -head or a bowl of soup. Arriving in Shaime, however, it is evident that the local Shuar people have historically been quite willing to have 'something to do with' outsiders, perhaps more so than nowa days. Like other Shuar towns in the province, Shaime is a collection of owner -built -sawed above clay earth denuded of vegetation. At some point in their history, the area's inhabitants were induced t o come together to build a church and concentrate their dwellings in a small village, the better to attend church and approximate the appearance of The its people who previously had l ived dispersed through the forest, with each household having its own supply of freshwater and forest game. The latter must have been much more accessible, being forced to navigate their 133 way between houses rather than, as is currently the case, being able to simply give a wide berth to a single great concentration of armed Shuar men, which is what Shaime represents to them. As has been detailed, the only partly successful in individuals' worldviews in their own ima ge. Aside from the small group of Evangelicals, Catholicism is a yet the by the sorcery of The product of this bewitching is usually referred to in an to being treated by anyone other than a shaman, but it illness, like or [sic].' However, because it is actually generated by a it can only be cured by a shaman; conversely, a shaman does not cure diseases that arise in the normal course of life: - So an uwishin does not cure illness es that arise in and of themselves? - No. These are not cured by the uwishin . They are cured by western The notion of 'maldad' appears 2016). Whereas the latter of illness to the envious or resentful gaze of a fellow human being, the concept of 'maldad' as found among Shuar people is tied exclusively to role As replied, sick, 'It's only with sorcery. One would have to be a shaman. Regular, free, clean people - no.' That is not to say that there is no cross -over between indigenous A mazonian and folk Hispanic ideas, which can be found quite broadly throughout Ecuadorian sometimes reference the cause of an episode as the 'envy' of such -and-such a neighbour, or been actualised by contracting a shaman, who was the one to execute the magical attack. Similarly, many Shuar people accept the idea that 'maldad' can be diagnosed by passing an egg over the body of a sick person, then cracking the egg into a glass of water and examining the yolk. This practice, variants of which are common in mestizo society throughout the Americas (Casta\u00f1eda, Mediterranean world's long history of raising chickens for eggs, which is a relatively recently Shuar people. The functionality of explains why the most common preference in -seeking behaviour in Alto Nangaritza was neither outright rejection of nor complete reliance on clinical medicine: for most people, each have their place, depending on the cause of the illness in q uestion. A popular typology was the categorisation of illness words, a caused by a spe cific person). At this simplistic level of analysis can as mirrors research on traditional medicine that is wont t o describe local aetiologies as dividing between the 'naturalistic' or 'personalistic' (Green, 1999: 15), as detailed in Chapter 1. To this, many Shuar people add the complication that an ordinary herbal or clinical treatment in other illness was most articulately expressed by Byron, a young man from Shaime: When it is 'enfermedad de Dios', then just pills and traditional medicines is enough. When a person has done 'da\u00f1o' against you, no matter how many pills and medicines you take, you won't get better. Say you get an injection, it will just make you worse. For this reason, first you have to consult the uwishin . The idea that herbal or clinical atments may make an illness worse was also by Ximena, a middle -aged woman from Shaime. Sorcery, she said, 'isn't something that can just be cured like that, with a remedy or an injection, because it goes against these things.' This was part of th e more general notion, expressed by the elder woman Dolores, that medicines can be 'jealous' and that employing more than one is b e cured by pharmaceutical and may actually be made worse because of 'jealousy', has been documented among mothers on the Colombian Pacific coast (Delgado et. al., 2006: 249). However, it contrasts with the findings of emph an 136 'etiology that conceives aggression person's ontologic al aspects -human in the correct diagnosis Shuar people. Of course, this style of reasoning, where the efficacy of treatments attempted is used to the A good example was put forward by Roberto from Alto Nangaritza: - Let's say that right in this moment I feel bad and I have an illness that can't be c ured by pills or other medicines. That's the signal. If it doesn't respond, we know to go to an uwishin and seek out a treatment. Then the uwishin will drink nat\u00e9m and examine you and say, 'No, isn't an illness that could just happen to anyone. This i llness is from a person 'que te ha hecho da\u00f1o' ('who has done you harm'). From then, the uwishin can heal you and make you feel free of it. - Ok, so the uwishin is specifically for illnesses that have been caused by another person? - Yes, and he can take a way the 'males' that another person has done to you. The same mode of understanding was expressed by Ximena Charip, from Churubia on the other side of the province: - Is it difficult at times to tell between something that a doctor can cure and something that a shaman can cure? - You have to see. If the illness is cured straightaway by a doctor, then it's an illness that was put there by God. Then if it's not cured by the doctor and the medicines from the hospital, 137 but instead it gets to work [sic], then y ou know that it's not a sickness for that. Then we have to seek out a shaman who can cure the person. If the shaman cures the person, that's how you know what it was. This same logic of interpretation was attested to among the Achuar by Descola some noted shamanically derived illness 'is recognisable not to non -shamanistic techniques illness as produced by in mestizo society (e.g. Ramos Cordoba, 2011: 125). Whether people turn first to herbal or clinical medical treatments, shamanism will remain a popular way any a person cannot be cured by other available means and falls through the cracks, so to speak, of the other models of illness and healing. This indigenous conception of sorcery is a central reason explaining why few Shuar in remote regio ns of Zamora -Chinchipe rely exclusively on clinical medicine. A further factor has, however, more to do with the nature of clinical care in the region. The medicines provided by clinicians in the Shaime clinic, which attends to Shuar people from all of the Upper Nangaritza Basin, were regularly criticised as simply that the clinics 'give but they aren't really good.' An interviewee from the same town, Rafael, said similarly that 'these [medicines] are just \"calmantes\". They have their utility, but then when the time comes one is left just the same, or worse.' Another, Ricardo, said: [T]here are the medicines and the vitamins that we take fro m the pharmacy, but they're worth nothing to us. They don't cure us. Or if they do cure us, it's just for a while. It alieves you for a while, but within two weeks the same sickness is back. That's why to be cured, it's better for us to find some remedy th at we can prepare at home. Similarly, interviewee from Kiim said, 'My brother told me, \"If you take that injection, it will just be a 'calmante' and you'll wake up with the though not entirely absent in the other areas of study, it was raised nowhere else with anywhere near the same prevalence. This suspicion or critique of the nature of the provided at stat e-run hostility on the part of Shuar people toward clinics, as well as the Ecuadorian state and mestizo society. It was a common, throw -away comment for doctors to be referred to as 'matasanos': is to say, 'killers of healthy people.' For example, when asked why his children were all born at home instead of at the hospital, Antonio from Shaime replied, 'Well, the hospital, they just give injections and use serum, and they kill people that way. So seeing as we have our own products, we do not need to go there. Many people die at the hospital. So we don't.' Another Shaime resident, Justino, said, 'And now, we have a government that is trying to exterminate us with these medicines . The government wants to give us injections so that we are normalised and don't produce more children.' Ricardo, also a young man from Shaime, said: The colonisers want to do away with the race of Shuar altogether [...] So of course, when we go to the hosp ital, they help us, and then they give us bad injections and bad remedies and bad treatments, and we don't realise because we don't know what kind of remedy it is. Sure, we have some idea: 'This is remedy for 'this allergies,' but we don't know exactly what these products do. 139 Segundo was another from Shaime who connected his anti -government political sentiment he argued. They don't help for anything. It is like a phantasm, a drug, no, not even a himself doesn't realise what is being done to our poor people, our poor nationality, how we ind igenous people are castigated. Traditional medicines will be all gone and they'll put only their medicines. One can see here a glimpse of the way the discussion about indigenous medicine and intercultural health is, for many Shuar people, entirely bound up with questions of rights over land use and ownership and resistance to further colonisation of their territory (see Chapter 7). It is also, as will be discussed in Chapter 4, fundamentally entwined with the capacity to use medicinal plants as part of what we would term spiritual practices, but are for many Shuar people central to their conceptualisation of the right way to live. Others' preferences where were life and death. Roberto Taish, for example, described an experience of a 'false fraught and requested that the family relocate the hospital in Yantzaza. However later, after a consultation with the mother -to-be's decided that doctors were mistaken. wife proceeded Similarly, Alma she makes between medical and non -medical treatment for the liver -stones she herself suffered 140 and later, doctors proposed This option because felt by the patients and their families regarding the idea of having their bodies cut by doctors, along with a of skepticism toward mes tizo society. We didn't want it to happen. So all of us, his children, met and decided to tell the doctor not to. They just wanted to do it to learn and be able to graduate in their studies, these apprentices. We are not going to obey. We'll tell them no. In both cases, the patients were able to find relief outside the biomedical system. with a herbal preparation by an uwishin , while her father was cured with a medicine provided by a herbalist based in a nearby town. In a context where the legitimacy of in favour of other options in future. Finally, the Upper Nangaritza River Basin was the region where the perceived importance of traditional practices of vision enough to resist easy categorisation with the language we h ave at our disposal. Some interviewees spoke of it directly as a ritual of empowerment. Bol\u00edvar Chumpi, from Shaime, described to me the qualities of datura, oft -remarked upon by Shuar people through the province, as a poultice for treating broken bones an d similar injuries. He then commented: Even if nothing is broken, it can be drunk, in order to see visions, to be able to see what luck we are going to have, or if we are going to have luck or not, and in order to have more power 141 and strength. For this re ason, we fast for three days, and then we drink it. One goes to the waterfall each morning. For others, such plants were spoken akin to a therapeutic tool that provided insight into personal problems, leading emotional regarding the steps necessary to face Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), p articularly in the treatment of addiction (e.g. Halpern, 1996; Mangini, 1998). In a similar vein, many young people and parents testified to the significance of visionary experience for adolescents in order that they might mature into a sense of purpose an d dynamism in life; or else the practice could be viewed as providing a key to attaining knowledge in the most general sense. As the grandmother Alma Tunki said: - Yes, that as well. The visions. It helps you to see. One sees everything. It shows you if y ou are going to get sick. It shows you everything in visions, the positives and the negatives. - In your life, in your relationships? - In everything. How we're sharing our relationships, what work needs to be done, everything. This complex of ideas about psychedelic visions involving knowledge, health, strength, self-development, destiny and socialisation elaborated upon in the following chapter. By documenting this the most profound of ontological difference among Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe, we can understand both the need for interculturality in state institutions, as well as attempt to find what (if any) common ground there may be with the purview of public health as understood in the western nation -state system. 142 Mining and Materialism in Healthcare in the Quimi River Valley Both the physical and the socio -economic landscape in the Quimi River Valley are marked by the Mirador gold and copper project, a large -scale mining operation expected tonnes of copper ore and 535,500 ounces of gold over 17 years, worth an estimated total of USD $10.6 billion. The company operating the mine is called EcuaCorriente (ECSA), which since 2010 has been owned jointly by the China Railway Construction Corporation and Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group, both Chinese state - owned companies (Sacher, 2011: 9 -13). Alongside this economic opportunity, however, is the threat of industrial -scale contamination of the watershed, which has generated vehement opposition to the mine a mongst some. That said, waged miners were present in both of the valley's two Shuar towns -Yanua and Churubia -and several others who did not work for 'the company' carried out their own, small -scale gold mining operations. Of the twenty -eight people I was a ble to interview in the Quimi River Valley, twelve were waged miners and another five small Amazon Basin is highly questionable, the support f or the Mirador mine among many Shuar locals (and the Ecuadorian state) is not hard to understand. Of the Shuar people within the purview of this study, the residents of the Quimi River Valley near the Mirador gold and copper mine had opportunities for wage d labour most machinery that can by just a few people to 'wash' soil on river -banks and hillsides in search of gold. The practice is politically contentious, supported by Pachakutik but prohibited by the which highligh ts environmental damage from the alleged use of mercury by 'artisan' miners. In November 2013, an attempt by the Ecuadorian military to shut down illegal mining on a river near Gualaquiza triggered a firefight resulting in the death of a Shuar man and inju ries to nine of the ten soldiers on patrol (Hoy, 2013). The political heat of the debate stems also from the tragic death of over 300 people following a landslide at an unregulated mine site near Zamora on 10 May 1993 (Torres T., 2004: 278). 143 a 15 days -on/15 days -off schedule, for which they were paid according minimum wage ($340) in Ecuador in 2014. This makes fo r a very favourable economic situation for the local miners: living on ancestral land, they are not obliged to pay rent; they have plenty of days free to contribute to clearing land for and maintaining the gardens where women grow the food to feed their fa milies; and many also spend their free 15 days in 'artisan' mining operations for further income. By contrast, Shuar Alto for several months to sell $40 or turn to logging or raising cattle to generate the cash they need for clothing, cartridges and building materials. In marked contrast to the ideas and experiences that were the currency of everyday conversation in the Upper Nangaritza Valley, many of t he Shuar people engaged in mining in the Quimi River Valley spoke in common -sense terms easily recognisable to a western observer. Common sense, of course, is one of the most maligned notions in the discipline of anthropology, such that the very fact of th e prevalence of a western style of common sense among the Shuar people of this region constitutes the core of the problem for discussion here and in Chapter 6. When I asked Mateo of Churubia, for example, about his and his actions in responding to illness, he replied: Of course, when it comes to sickness, I am affiliated to social security and when my children are ill, I take them for medical attention. They've attended to us well there. We haven't had any problems. [...] As you know, all the hospit als and medicines are free. This is what I can tell you. Before, my ancestors used to cure themselves, let's say, when they suffered a snakebite; they had many medicines that they applied. 144 In other words, it was perceived as the obvious, responsible thing to do to take one's children for 'medical attention,' and it was taken as a given that this meant the local hospitals and clinics. Reference is then made, in the imperfect tense, to herbal medicine as something that the ancestors once did. This was t he most common perception of medicinal plants: as a desirable practice, as something that worked, but also as something that has been left behind and a subject about which only one of the waged miners interviewed to be knowledgeable. On the shamanic healing, it was normal to hear dismissals of the practice, paired with minimal interest in the question. As an the following: - I'm wondering if you've ever been to see a shaman, maybe for yours elf or for treating your kids? For 'mal aire', let's say, or be perfectly honest, believed in such things in my cleansings, all that. So I have never been; neither myself nor my husband. - Ok, well I was j ust asking because many people mention these things in other towns. - No. For whatever problem we may have, first we always go to the clinic in Tundayme. Similarly, a young man from Yanua employed at the mine said, 'I've never been one to do this,' when as ked if he had ever taken his young children for treatment from a shaman. A variation was the response from Mateo, who explicitly to be more based on his dismissal of his own generation's knowledge. When asked about the existence of shamans who were able to cure, he replied, 'Not in this area any longer. Shaman shaman [i.e. true shaman], there's nothing of that here anymore. I mean, you hear them putting ads o n the radio.' As will be discussed in Chapter 6, the explicit dismissals of ancestral knowledge by 145 Shuar residents of the Quimi River Valley suggests that the interplay of cultural inheritance and cultural vectors has produced a complex politics of belief and disbelief. With regard to vision -seeking via altered states of consciousness, those who had pursued the practice mostly did so purely out of curiosity. Compared with people in Nangaritza, there seemed to be less of a will or capacity to contextualise t he practice and experience within a broader universe of meaning, or even as a personal touchstone for comprehending one's own life questions. Revealing in this regard was the reference to visions as being like 'watching a movie,' or one man's desire to try drinking ayahuasca because his 'grandfather used to say that in his visions he saw lots of women.' At the same time, the danger here is to contrast these people's thoughts with an imagined past where Shuar knowledge was treated as pure and sacred. After a ll, traditional final publications, and kno wledge expressed by shamanic specialists. For moment, here is simply that while belief in shamans and vision -seeking among Shuar people in the Quimi River Valley was far from the generalised acceptance observable in Nangaritza, it should also not be characterised as a case of simple assimilation into the kind of materialism associated with secular rationalism in the western world. Among the minority whose preferences mirrored those of people in Kiim and Nangaritza, their reasoning was much th e same as people in those areas. They queried the efficacy of basic pharmaceutical -based medical attention category treatments for 146 'sicknesses of God,' a s opposed to 'sicknesses of man' that are cured by mother Churubia, described textbook example of a sickness suffered by her daughter which she attributed to the envy of a neighbour, and which she said worsened following clinical treatment before being properly resolved by a local healer. These same ideas could be seen among many of the so -called 'artisan' miners valley, whose preferences between healing practices tended to be closer to those of Shuar people in the subsistence economy than to those of waged miners. Unfortunately, with a sample size of just five, there is little that can be made by way of comparison between the formally employed miners and their 'artisan' counterparts. The next chapter is the f irst in a series of four in which each will address one of the cultural vectors described so far and critically interpret its impact upon the health -seeking practices and ontology of Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe. The series begins by discussing the mai ntenance of traditional ontology in health -seeking the Upper region; then moves to a of Evangelism as a competing form of spirituality; then to way the Pachakutik party and the discourse of indigenous cultural rights affects Shuar people's relationship with ancestral health knowledge and prac tice. I argue that these vectors just as to explaining current practices and worldviews as the particularities of shared ethnicity, history and cultural inheritance of this population of indigenous people. The dynamics between these vectors a nd their interactions with this Shuar for the complexity of intracultural diversity among of the region. When modified with attention given to the 147 particularities of local culture, the process of the study offers a wa y to model the evolution of indigenous culture and ontology in the context states. 148 Chapter 4: Traditional Ontology in the Sickness and Health of Twenty -First Century Shuar The role of ontological commitments in to begin with the potential of health on the marked cultural difference in the present research: that of Shuar territory in th e Upper Nangaritza River Basin (Alto Nangaritza) in and around the Shuar centre of Shaime. This chapter seeks to explain the data in Chapter 3 which showed that Shuar people in this remote region saw the least benefit in clinical medical services and, by contrast, placed the greatest importance on visionary practices for their health and on shamanic practice for the diagnosis and healing of illness. In so doing, it example critique of biomedicine based on cultural difference, wit h its roots in the ontological and epistemological specificities of the conceptual inheritance of Amazonian people. As such, this chapter may be seen as a proof of concept for the value of intercultural health (and state interculturality in general) to sti mulate entirely new conceptualisations of and approaches to healthcare, or any other public competency of importance to a given political collective. with the problem of sorcery or 'maldad,' the principal fear for which Shuar people c onsult shamans for advice, diagnosis and healing. Through the exploration of 'maldad' it becomes clear that for Shuar people in remote regions, sickness is not necessarily perceived, as it is in biomedicine, as a temporary deviation from the factors,' typically conceived as a individual way that conceals macro -level intracommunal, intercommunal and interspecies levels. The way in which these power relations function and the ideals of hea lth and establish are successively explicated in this chapter and subsequent visionary practices aimed development of individual power. Illnesses can be revelatory of our most essential beliefs about the nature of the world and our place in it, as they generate crises that painfully illuminate our divergent experiences of ourselves as both that which is most intimate and personal, and as inscrutable, disobedient objects. paradoxes of human existence...[which] centre upon the unity, and at the same time the duality, of mind and body, the ambiguity of self as subject and object, and the opposition of natural and social being' (1982: 51). Medicine, then, is an ideal terrain on which to study interculturality, dependent as it is on the profundities of our assumptions about the nature of reality. 150 Figure 5: with hunting -dogs 2014 151 Zamora -Chinchipe in the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Upper Nangaritza River Basin, which sits in the far south -eastern corner of the country, is the one region with a manifest difference between the cultures of the indigenous Shuar people and mai nstream mestizo society. Thanks to the vagaries of geography, geology and the long history of Peruvian -Ecuadorian hostilities, the region remained very much isolated until just a few years before fieldwork for this project began, when the bridge crossing t he Nangaritza River at Las Orqu\u00eddeas was completed. This tiny settlement on the river's edge, some two -thirds the Nangaritza 'cant\u00f3n' capital Guayzimi, was previously the end of the road. Shuar people from fu rther up -river were obliged to travel to Las Orqu\u00eddeas by motorised canoe along the rocky, shallow waters of the Nangaritza River so as to connect with the rest of Ecuador. Many, of course, did not have the means to do so. Mateo Yankuam, who I met in Kiim but who formerly lived far up-river from Shaime, me a six -day round -trip he used to make to buy medicines and other supplies; they would make a raft and float downstream, then sell everything they had brought with them, make their purchases an d walk back up -river. The Shuar of Alto Nangaritza, then, of all the interviewees in this study, live and experience most deeply the complex of ideas developed autonomously by their ancestors; in comparison with the rest of the province, they are to a larg e extent economically autonomous, and have only as to be saved by Evangelism and as working -class in their positioning with respect to capital, two points which will be the subject of Chapters 5 and 6 respectiv ely. 152 Figure 6: Shaime and the R\u00edo Nangaritza from above, looking south 'Maldad', Sickness and Power in Alto Nangaritza Of all the notions through which illness and healing is conceptualised in Alto Nangaritza, the most beguiling and to within rational public policy is that illness can be caused by the malevolent will of a specialist in such matters, whether acting at a distance or the of ostensibly mundane intermediate objects. introduced broadly speaking this envy was not considered active in and of itself. At one point, I was 153 laughed at by my companions in Shaime for suggesting that my own envy and negative thoughts mi ght make another person ill; 'you'd only make sick,' I was the hilarity. Instead, envy or any other form of ill will was understood as the motivation for a person to contract a shaman to 'harm' ('hacerle da\u00f1o') another and make them s ick with suffering was also of material envy in these remote parts. In this sense, the deployment of envy as an explanation for disease amon g Shuar people is ostensibly reminiscent the instinctive egalitarianism throughout history (e.g. 1980: 20). By as shamanically produced illness motivated by en vy holds true as an ideal type, there were hints that it was, more precisely speaking, the most common manifestation of a more complex picture. The position of the shaman, which seems at first to be that of a specialist trained in techniques of which other s are entirely ignorant, may be described more comprehensively as that of an individual able to perpetuate and cure 'maldad' by virtue of their position of exceptional relative power. This can be borne out by inference from discussions of 'da\u00f1o' suffered b y infants, those with the lowest relative power on the social terrain. Some examples were offered by C\u00e9sar Santiak, the shaman in Shaime: [O]ne simply sees a chubby baby and gets causes the baby 'da\u00f1o'. Or there can also be a negative energy that a person has, a build -up of negative energy. S/he picks up the baby and like that causes the baby 'da\u00f1o'. The baby gets diarrhoea or something. Every person has the capacity to do this, even though they're not an uwishin , without str ong energy since birth. 154 Others maintained that an infant could be 'marked' ('marcado') and become sick if cradled by a pregnant woman, and that mothers therefore had to be awake to the possibility that a neighbour who they allowed to hold their child may n ot yet be aware that she is pregnant. Similarly, one woman -a middle -aged mother of seven who lived far up -river in Nangaritza in a house set well into the forest -said that infants can catch 'bronchitis' when a powerful animal passes close by the house. She proffered the example of the jaguar, but also agreed that the same effect could be provoked by a snake, fox or ocelot. The water - willow piri-piri (Justicia pectoralis) was administered by this mother as a prophylactic remedy to her babies for this purpose .39 The weak position of an infant in relation to an envious neighbour, a pregnant woman or a powerful animal mirrors that of a shaman vis -\u00e0-vis an ordinary person. C\u00e9sar Santiak related the following about his to harm others: For examp le, if I wanted to do 'da\u00f1o', I wouldn't just do it right in this moment. Rather, one's energy has to be prepared. If I were arguing with a person and their energy was low, I would dominate them and they would get sick. Shaime Wampash ex plained his experience of 'hechicer\u00eda' in the same vein of relative power or energy: - Does it ['maldad'] always come from another person, or it is just something that happens in life? - It is always from another person. I have a particular case, what happened to me. On one occasion, I was sick, feeling pain in all of this part. - Your back? 39 Intriguingl y, the Peruvian Aguaruna, a related consider one may tsentsak with which shamanic power is exercised via the ingestion of piri-piri (Brown, 1985: 60 -61). 155 - My back. Like it was going to break. Afterwards I went to a shaman and he examined me and he gave me nat\u00e9m , ayahuasca, and he said to me, 'Look, see which person .' In that way, the person who has done wrong ('mal') by you becomes clear. It makes us see this. And we understand that this person is of bad faith. This happened to me. When a person of bad faith does wrong by a person ('le hace mal a una persona'), it i s very clear. So we go to the shaman. He does his treatment, and on the next day all of the pain has gone away, and one is left feeling fine ('tranquilo'). For this reason, we believe in sorcery [...] When a person, a shaman, is of good faith, he doesn't har m other people. But when he is of bad faith, we say that the power that he has is oriented towards doing ill ('maldades'). And if he has a strong energy ('una energ\u00eda fuerte') and that collides with a person who is weak, it produces sickness. However, if a ll individuals possess a degree of 'energy' or 'power' that is invisible to the naked eye, where is such power situated, and on what field does it act? Within a paradigm of philosophical materialism, it would be easy to slip a categorisation of 'maldad' as the physiological terrain claimed by medical science as its field of specialisation. The shaman would then become essentially a professional specialist adept in coming up wi th 'culture - bound ways of coping,' according to one proposal for recognising and incorporating cultural in healthcare (see Constantine, & 2004: 115), which illustrates the fraught nature of accepting the position of 'the c ultural' as leverage for rights. Such an outcome is not alien to potential mobilisations of the concept of intercultural health in Latin America, which has been defined by a leading advocate in Mexico as 'the set of biomedical knowledge and practice applie d in different cultural contexts' (Campos Navarro, 1999: 76), mainly implying the use of foods, language and 156 furniture appropriate to the characteristics of local 77 as materialism is evidentl y not an ontology shared by Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza, an intercultural state that accepts a definition of culture as a of 'maldad' as a trivial, 'spiritual' issue. The division between the spiritual and physiological is alien to the ontology implied in many Shuar testimonies of illness and healing, particularly in Alto Nangaritza. Shuar do herbal r emedies without making 'spiritual' interventions or reference to non -ordinary originate terminate in the body. For example, in a discussion regarding the firmness of the distinction between good and bad shamans, C\u00e9sar Santiak said of the latter: - They can hardly cure at all, because the body has learned to perform this 'maldad.' - So it has to be generated from the body? - Yes, definitely. This is why [indigenous] doctors can get sick in their practice. It's an energetic thing, no? The central ity of the shaman's body to their work is also evident in the notion that they are able to 'suck' the 'maldad' out of their patient's body, draw it into their own and then either neutralise or dispose of it. This was a to indigenous people, but fall short of contributing to the development of an inter cultural healthcare that would benefit from a diversity of approaches grounded he would visibly vomit the 'maldad' out of his own body. The drawing into their own body by a shaman of an object or essence reputed to be causing a patient's account Martina Tukupi, a resident of Shaime. Martina had trained as a shaman in the aftermath of the death of her you ng daughter and a prolonged illness she herself suffered, both of which she attributed to 'maldad' directed at her family due to her father's activities as a shaman. For Martina, the training was a means of protecting herself, and so she stayed on for six months with a Kichwa shaman from the northern Ecuadorian Amazon of thus convinced her of his capacities. Her serves as an introduction to a number of elements that are widely corroborated among Shuar people province whose worldview by than by other influences. In Martina's words: - So I spoke with this shaman. I had told him that I was tired of this conflict, and that I was always sick ('vivo enfermo' [sic]). So he said, 'If you want, I will give you this power, so that you may become yachaj [Kichwa word meaning are very strong [sic], and when a woman takes hold of this power , the woman is even more 158 powerful than a man. So I had to stay there a while. We would drink nat\u00e9m as well as liquor. This shaman knew about nat\u00e9m , but about black magic ('magia negra') and white magic ('magia blanca'). [...] - Did he always call some sort of spirit to help in curing? - Yes. For example, when one has an active spirit ('esp\u00edritu vivo'), one heh .' That was the rhythm for calling, the way to call. So then one had to be ready. The spirit, the power that it has -'Puh! '-a woman is presented to you, or a person. During the drunkenness, this person sings, and the way that it sings, one starts to sing in that way as well. - So you watch, listen, and copy, or is it like it is you? - It is inevitable that one then copies, and sings. - Does everyone see this? - person one this or wasn't taught the songs. But what would happen is that my body felt...it was like I was becoming very large. I felt very sick. From there, I could grab hold of the sick person then and cure them very quickly. So this was a step that I learned. [...] When I had recently taken hold of that power from the shaman, I went to leave for home, and the maestro said to me, 'You are leaving very well -protected. You must never hit another person, nor get into arguments, nor be aggressive (\"brava\"). Do not get angry.' So for me, because I am 'brava,'41 this was directed against my husband. One morning, he complained to me about what I had been doing, and he said, 'If you continue, I'll declare you to the community [as a shaman], and we will separate.' When he said that to me, it made me 41 A popular adjective in S huar country, understood to mean aggressive, direct. 159 angry. I told him, 'I don't want you to talk like that. If you want to do that, then fine. I am just looking for a way to protect the family.' That is how I answered him. It made me deeply angry. It arose that 'energ\u00eda' in me. He got up from bed. And as he was going down the steps here, he was struck with dizziness, and he went and lay down over there. He was lying down, and I asked him, 'What's wrong?' 'My replied. So I grabbed a remedy f or him and I went and blew over him. This stopped the pain a little, and we went to tend to the cattle. Then as we were moving them, his arm fell down by his side, and he couldn't raise it up again. We came back to the house, and he was in a bad way and ve ry faint. I remember the shaman who gave me power said that I should not let myself be seen by any other shaman. [My husband] didn't really believe in these things. But in any case, we went to see the shaman [in Shaime]. So what I did was 'apply my secret ('aplicar mi secreto'), so that he wouldn't notice me. The shaman drank nat\u00e9m and he was sitting there, and I was waiting to see if he would become aware of me. Eventually he said to 'You have been arguing in any arguments,' my husband replied. 'You have, you have argued with someone,' said the shaman. My husband knew, of course, that he had been arguing with me. It was eleven at night by this point. I was sitting there, and I noticed a cricket sitting on my arm. 'What's that?' asked. I me,' said the shaman. 'Why is this inside the house, instead of outside?' he wondered. 160 This is what I had put onto my husband. It was a defence that I could have put onto anyone, and they would have become sick. And so, now that I'd taken it into my hand, I withdrew it. So the shaman started to suck and suck at [my hus band], but there was nothing there, not even a dart ('flecha'). That's the nature of black magic ('magia'); there was no dart, it was only air ('aire'). [My husband] said to me, 'Martina, what's going on? In my dream, I was watching you, and you had a flam e burning from the top of your head. And then you said to me, \"I didn't want it to be this way. I never wanted to do you any harm ('da\u00f1o').\" That's what you promised to me. So, Martina, tell me what is going on?' 'I don't know,' I eam' ('Sue\u00f1o es sue\u00f1o'). I hid this from my husband. And if anyone else had become aggressive with me, or had argued with me or wanted to hit me, that person would become sick. That is what the power was. The Shamanic Diagnosis of Sorcery For many Shuar p eople, especially in Alto Nangaritza, their physical being is intertwined with a normally invisible matrix of energies and influences which must be skilfully navigated if they are to be healthy and thrive. As can already be glimpsed in the of M artina and Celestino, ayahuasca ( nat\u00e9m ) is for such to perceive, understand and empower themselves within this of influence, energy and relative power. 'Maldad' is evidently visible in the visions provoked by hallucinogenic plants, which Shuar people refer to as both 'sue\u00f1os' and 'visiones.' Dreams and plant -induced hallucinations seem to near -equivalent ontological status in traditional Shuar worldview. The shaman C\u00e9sar Santiak once interpreted a particular 161 dream of mine as indicative that someone was attempting to afflict me with 'maldad', which suggests that a dream, like a hallucinogenic vision, is considered be revelatory of external referents. Shamans, of course, cannot dream and still be awake enough to ex amine their patients. As such, ayahuasca is indispensable in order to 'see'42 and diagnose and 'maldad' as - What does it look like? - It looks like a burning bullet. It will go through the system eventually, and if it is strong it will burn up the entire organism. Yanua resident Ricardo Kayuk, who never practised openly as a shaman but was trained in the same way, described the appearance of 'maldad' almost identically. - When you look at the patient, how can you tell what sickness they have? - It's clear. If it is 'mal hecho', the part where they are affected looks like it is alight. - It shines? - Yes. You see it while you are well drugged. So wherever it is that they are hurting is where you need to suck at them [...] So you suck it in then throw it away. You have to vomit it all away, then blow over them with perfume. You are taking out the 'mal hecho', so you have to know how to vomit it out, not take it into your bod y, or you'll die. Accounts from ordinary, non -shaman residents of Alto Nangaritza regarding the diagnosis of illness in ayahuasca shamanism corroborated those of Ricardo Kayuk and C\u00e9sar Santiak. 42 The notion that ayahuasca shamans able 'seeing' Amazonia, as a sudden illness, for which one would need to seek out a shaman immediately. The shaman will be able to say, \"You've been 'made ill' while drinking ayahuasca.\" [...] The shaman who is of good faith has to drink ayahu asca and look over you, he has to have tobacco, and blowing tobacco over [you] he can see everything. While doing that, he can see, \"It was that man who did you harm ('da\u00f1o').\" Then if I have a little money, and the shaman I am seeing is stronger than the one who did me harm, then the shaman I'm seeing can cure me with his faith in God. These testimonies regarding the use of ayahuasca in shamanism are reminiscent of the early conceptualisation of in psychology in sense of facilitating the of otherwise invisible phenomena -in the case of psychology, the inner workings of the human psyche -which of shamanism in the region, such as the life history of Alejandro Tsakimp, a Shuar based in an ens orcelled person, I see everything, as if the person is naked. I see the form of the skeleton, and I can see if the person will live or die. [...] I saw him carefully, and I thought, 'This is the tsentsak that wants to kill him. This isn't an illness; he got it through chicha and through concentration' (2002: 163). There is a close correlation between these accounts of shamanic diagnosis as based upon the examination of the patient while making use of an ayahuasca -induced state of 43 Metzner writes, 'it has repeatedly been said that psychedelics could play the same role in psychology as the microscope doe s in biology.' heightened sensory percepti on. What is notably different, however, is the metamorphosis of the concept of tsentsak as the invisible agent of super -physiological illness into 'maldad' in the accounts of my shaman interlocutors some two decades after the time when Rubenstein's fieldwo was carried out. In Alejandro that the effects of ayahuasca; several Shuar men told m e that they were able to perceive distant events or the answers to 'flechas' by Martina when speaking in Spanish) refers, in a literal sense, to the poisoned darts fired from blowpipes that were the primary tool of hunters before the arrival of firearms, and are mentioned as a central shamanistic tool by Brown (1985: 60), Harner (1968: 30), as a sort of layman's approximation of a concept which ordinary people cannot be expected to perceive or comprehend (Descola, attribute shift metaphors from ' tsentsak ' to 'maldad' to contemporary Shuar people's greater familiarity with Spanish and of 'envidia' and 'maldad' than with shamanic attacks to local weaponry tha t it is not coincidental that the contemporary shaman C\u00e9sar Santiak compared the appearance of 'maldad' to a bullet, and that Walter Wampash likened the attack of a powerful shaman to being shot. 44 In a manner analogous to what we have been told by C\u00e9sar and Ricardo, Whitten reports that Amazonian Quichua shamans in psychedelic trance see tsintsaca as glowing blue under the skins of their patients. 164 In a similar vein to the testimonies regarding the visible appearance of 'maldad', interviewees 'maldad' becomes apparent under the effects of said that '[w]hen someone it is very clear. The person wh o has done it comes in defence, as clear as you are sitting here. They come to stop the person from being cured.' Likewise, Mateo Kuash from Kiim said, 'In the concentration sees who has carried the \"maldad\"'. Another from influence datura. 'This makes one which people are opposed to you,' he said. 'Whether they wish you death or \"maldad,\" any of the kinds of \"maldad\" that there are. \"Guantu\" [datura] gives you all kinds luck. Via dreams it reveals everything to you.' Clearly Shuar people do not consider ayahuasca and datura to provoke mere hallucinations, nor even to facilitate an enhanced psychotherapeutic state that is helpful purely at the level of individual psychology, but means as these plants were mentioned so regularly in discussions on the subject of health and medicine, or why they are so widely consumed. Wilson Kayuk, the head of a large household in Yanua living outsi de the mining economy, described ayahuasca as not just a form of diagnosis but also as a sort of vaccination against 'maldad': 'As we have this power of nat\u00e9m , we cannot fall into this trap of maldad. We protect ourselves from the bad faith of those around us.' Similarly, Shaime's Walter Wampash claimed, three (\"lograr el esp\u00edritu\") and to be able to survive 165 and become stronger spiritually, and al to Some accounts of visionary experiences are revealing in terms of what they say about the nature of 'maldad' and the meaning of 'this power of nat\u00e9m ' within Shuar ontology in remote regions of Zamora - Chinchipe. Visionary Experience in Shuar People's Lives If sickness can be caused by a position of relative weakness with respect to those who might wish do harm, the close association between health and power is unsurprising. Moreover, the fact that shamans are considered the most dan gerous figures with regard to 'maldad' testifies to the notion that power can visionary from Alto Nangaritza, as well as some of those from the Quimi River Valley who lived outside the waged economy. the therapeutic of yerba mate. These plants, he said, could cure flu, bloating, respectively; however, 'these power and your luck [...] it means that we do n't feel lazy or listless.' Ayahuasca is a 'medicine' that specifically acquiring not something that is drunk for healing. Well, when a little is drunk as a medicine [in the case o f broken bones], then yes. But its proper use is for acquiring power: you acquire power to have money, to have a good woman, to have a lot of chooks, or perhaps to have a lot of women.' Roberto's testimony includes two ideas that are 166 intimately related for Shuar people. The value given to the Walter interview, for he that needed to be taken when drinking datura: If one is going to use maikiua , one has to fast for 15 -20 days: with the stomach empty, going to the waterfalls, to the rocks and high mountains. - Can you drink chicha? - You can drink chicha, but only very little, and less and less. More, you drink tsaank (tobacco), [because] the body has to feel cushioned, so as not to feel hunger. It is from such sacrifice that God sees that sacrifice and knows that the person is trying to achieve/find ('lograr') something, so that in dreams ('sue\u00f1os'), he will tell you something, he will let you find the dreams to which he has destined you. When speaking of acquiring power, then, Shuar people imply both the experience of a vision as well as the purging of the body, resulting in its subsequent vitality and stoicism. This is an element that is consistent wi th other accounts of the importance of plant - induced visionary experience, even if it is often not the primary focus. Consider the much briefer account of Bol\u00edvar Shaime who said that one should drink ayahuasca and datura 'in order to see vis ions, to be able to see what luck we are going to have, or if we are going to have luck or not, and in order to have more power and strength.' Similarly, Fernando Tsakimp, from Churubia, 'gives a man potency to live a long time.' 167 When phrased in such a way, it is made to seem that greater power is the automatic result of drinking such plant concoctions, which generates a very abstract impression of the practice. This is exacerbated by the reticence of some to speak about th e details of visionary anthropologist, Rubenstein, who lived in Morona - Santiago for several years in the 1990s, reported that the only Shuar people who would reveal the details of their visions to him were those who had already seen them come true (2012: 51), and some of the Shuar I met shared this custom. Fernando Tsakimp of Churubia, for one, of had a sore throat. Later she was telling her mother that it reveal ed many things to her and explained to her where she had arrived at so far. It is very, very good. Of course, she can't reveal right now what dream it gave her. It gave her a good dream and she has to reach that point that it showed her. More commonly, in terviewees would simply confirm that they had drunk ayahuasca or datura and express that they had faith that their visions would be fulfilled, while sidestepping any effort on my part to prompt further elaboration on the experience. This was particularly the interview Rafael Nantip of Shaime. Fortunately, there were some who, for whatever reason, were willing to describe details of their visionary experiences. In these accounts, the sense of personal emp owerment was not an abstract and automatic result of consuming hallucinogenic plants, but instead seemed perspective on themselves, their identity, their capacities and their place in time. Byron Santiak, a Shaime man in his early t wenties, 168 offered an expressive account of the visions he in something he explored after having been cured of 'maldad' by a shaman: - Let me tell you something, when you have suffered 'da\u00f1o,' the symptoms are very clear. - Have you felt this yourself? - Yes. When I was young, I had problems with my vision. It was like a spider -web in front of my eyes. I was fine for my first twelve years, then this hit me. This web started to cover my vision more and more, and it stung like I had s alt in my eyes. - In one eye or both? - In both eyes. It got to the point where I couldn't see. I'd get headaches. At night -time it felt like a storm. My father took me to curanderos and they couldn't cure me. Then I went to my uncle, who also drank nat\u00e9m . He able to me. He cleaned out everything ('limpiar'). He was able to save me. From here on my head, and here on my chest, he pulled out a little bug. That was what was harming me. From there, I never felt the problem again. drank a lot of 'gua ntu' ( ) when I was very young, and nat\u00e9m . After I was cured, at twelve years -old, I started to drink [ maikiua and nat\u00e9m ] a lot. When I drank 'guantu,' I knew that I was going to be conscripted [into the army]. I saw that. I also saw myself going to school and learning how to use computers, how to ride a motorcycle. - And this motivated you? - Exactly. All of these dreams ('sue\u00f1os') are fulfilled. When you enter a program of study, for example, now that you've had the vision, once you begin, it's eas y. You pick up everything quickly. Drinking nat\u00e9m I also saw my wife. I was much younger, but I knew that I was going to marry her one day. These things are not obligatory for people. Maikiua , this makes you drunk for three days, but it is really good. Fr om very young, one can see what is going to unfold in your life. It's very good to drink from a young age. People can't put you off track easily. You have your own 169 talent. - Like a self -knowledge? - Self-knowledge. Just like that, it's very good to drink f rom a young age. Byron is clearly quite responsive to my own suggested framings terms of -knowledge.' Nonetheless, his is an account that it leads from the original motivation for drinking to the vi sions themselves and then his first - hand experience of their materialisation. Drawing from this account, the widely reported characteristic of ayahuasca and in particular datura of providing a vision of one's future comes across as an abbreviated explanati on. Instead, Byron spoke about how the foreshadowing of these personal feats in his visions allowed him to easily accomplish them when the time came. In this sense, the visions allowed him to see -before his time, as it were -his own place in the adult world modulated according to his own pre -existing desires and capacities, which were in turn modulated and concretised in the visionary experience.45 There is no evidence to suggest that Byron perceived his vision as a fact; he says, easily,' a recognition of the possibility of failure. By the same token, although the vision is never a guarantee, there is a clear sense that one's personal strength drawn from fulfilment of one's vision. Livi ng in alignment with vision is a source of power, while diversion from that vision is conversely a hazard and the origin of weakness and vulnerability.46 45 The role of hallucinogenic a person must be able to hold if they are to survive and which is dependent on their general level of strength and vitality. The dream ego is considered the counterpart one engages more than seeing a preordained future. The future exists as a set of possibilities that are given shape by the effort into the visionary experience' 60). 170 This broadening of personal perspective and attainment of a sense of purpose appears to be the source of the greater vitality and dynamism that is subsequently attributed by others as the direct outcome of the visionary experience. The desirability of these 'positive side -effects,' as it were, explains why the majority of interviewees related that their fi experiences motivation. After giving young people datura or ayahuasca, she said, You notice the difference in children that were lazy. They're no longer lazy. They become different. They become active, no longer slow. They work and they're no argumentative or capricious. for his children: - It is for their studies, for their life, for the time to come, particularly their studies. - So you want the child to become more dedicated? - Yes. They are more dedicated in their study and their work. When once they were lazy, they leave all that behind. They become dedicated to a different path. In contrast to the notion of an initiation rite that reveals to the initiate sacred information about the true nature of the world, adolescents' visionary experiences insight into their own capacity to act within that world. It does not make sense to speak of the indigenous understanding of health and medicine in Alto Nangaritza abstracted from the notion of vision as a guiding life ideal, as well as a quasi -object, in possession of which one becomes strong, healthy and empowered and without which one is left marginalised and vulnerable. The 171 statement that hallucinogenic visions are essential to health is one way of framing the notion that they play an essential role in a person's li fe development and Shuar people's idea of the right way to live. Power Vibrating on other Frequencies In a society composed of such well -adapted people with a clear sense of their direction in life, one might wonder where illness and social conflicts ori ginate. The key here is to understand that although visions are experienced in an intensely personal manner, they are not confined to the individual's psychology. In fact, vision for Shuar people is both an internal and an external phenomenon: in the latte r sense, a vision implicates a variety of other entities each typically possessing manifest constantly in the visible, everyday world. An experience of ill ness recounted by Freddy Santiak, half -brother to C\u00e9sar and some twenty years his junior, provides an amplification of the scope of this field of relative power on which 'maldad' becomes intelligible and to which dreams and psychedelic visions provide brie f but invaluable insights. - I used to go fishing, all the time, going out to fish [on the river] at night. I was fishing so much, day after day after day. And there, the animal from the water harmed me ('me hizo da\u00f1o'). I have still this mark on my body. - What was it? - It was the seahorse, as they say [in Spanish]. - I don't know what was happening at the time. I simply heard a whistling sound, not hing more, on the other side of the wall [by the river]. It harmed me and I started to vomit. - When you arrived back at your house? - No, right there at the dock. So I started to vomit. It was like that. We called my brother, C\u00e9sar Santiak. I fainted and I woke up in the house. This was when I started to learn about Shuar medicines. Tsunki, a term that can refer flexibly to a class of spirits as well as a singular being of the type, are water spirits who inhabit the underwater realm in a way that mirrors the sociality of human beings. As one of Philippe Descola's Achuar confidants put it sometime in the late 1970s in an isolated region of Morona -Santiago: 'Anaconda is one of Tsunki's domesticated animals and obeys him in everything, just like a dog. A few years ago, Yuu [...] visited Tsunki in his house, and there were lots of anacondas there; he was very scared. This Yuu met Tsunki because he is a powerful shaman, an sees things that we cannot [...] Yuu says that in the water, the Tsunki have hous es just like ours and that they are just like human beings in every way. The old Tsunki man was seated on a coiled anaconda and he had Yuu sit on a big tortoise that poked out its head to take a look at him with his round eyes' (1996: 143). So if Tsunki a re in 'embody[ing] all the precepts of ideal sociability' (Descola, 1996: 146), but a kind who live in -themed alternate universe which mostly parallels but also overlaps in some way with the visible world of humans, how and why did Freddy find himself the subject of their animosity? Freddy continued: What happened is, I was going out to fish every day. And as our ancestors said, our grandparents who lived here with us, they said, 'To Tsunki coronchos common Tsunki' ('Para Tsunki son gallinas los coronchos'). So Freddy was met with the same hostility that Shuar people reserve for the pesky foxes and ocelots that attempt their the archetyp al of mythology, the Tsunki may have become angry and struck down Freddy with an intangible attack of 'maldad.' Or perhaps 'maldad' is the only way to make sense of the human side of an experience which for Tsunki was the equivalent of firing a gun (which are visualised, Freddy was clearly overwhelmed by a power which he could not accurately perceive, and which had a near fatal impact on him. Figure 7: The Nangaritza River near Shaime 174 To make sense of this experience and the broader phenomenon of illnesses attributed to Shuar the ordinarily apparent phys ical world with other invisible and perhaps more fundamental layers of reality. Following Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, one could say that a clash of perspectives caused the illness of Freddy Santiak. In the formulation of Viveiros de Castro (1998) as well a s (e.g. 2013b: 132), the animist Amazonian peoples is said to invert western multiculturalism -in which the universal state of nature is opposed to the multiplicity of cultures -such that the universal state shared between all beings beco mes human consciousness, in spite physical forms of such beings as animals, plants and spirits. For the West, the fundamental element or substratum of reality is nature, for which culture is not an equal pair but instead one possible of nature. socio -cosmic medium' (Viveiros de Castro, 1998: 473) within which are conceals an internal human form, usually only visible to the eyes of the particular species or to certain trans -specific beings such as shamans' (1998: 472). In this case, then, a being which Freddy would only be able to perceive as 'a him through a 'socio - cosmic medium' of which in his ordinary, waking physical presence he was not aware, thus provoking an illness that was fever and a painful swelling that moved about his body over several days before forming into a weal near his armpit. In an example of the pragmatic modus operandi of Shuar patients and the mestizo medical doctors who attend to them in Alto Nangaritza, Freddy ultimately consulted a doctor at the clinic in Shaime, explained the entire series of events and was 175 prescribed a balm which facilitated the healing of the skin condition and his return to full health. Sorcery as Diversion If power, health and strength are generated by living in alignment with experience makes it clear that becoming embroiled in an alien vision can be a perilous turn of events. This principle helps to explain some of the more elusive examp les 'maldad' by explain why 'maldad' could be directed against a family as a whole, given that one's vision necessarily includes those in the immediate personal sphere. W ithin this framework, an illness recounted by Sonia from Shaime falls into place. In her words, when asked whether she had ever had reason to consult a shaman: - Well, we get married, and they say that crazy women look for other men, they say. I have imag ined this as well. Yes, this has happened to me. As I am now, I'm with my husband [...] as I said, there are people with bad hearts ('de mal coraz\u00f3n'), and this person had been seeing that was living well/right ('vivir bien'), and this person didn't like was living well, working...I don't know exactly. With this paper in the books of 'magia', as they say, a lot of young people learn them. I don't understand what it actually says in them. So this young man learned how to work with this, and it went agai nst me and harmed me ('va contra conmigo y hacerme da\u00f1o' [sic]). So I had problems and my husband told are sick.' sick,' I said. 'I don't have any pain in my body to be sick,' I was saying. But he said, 'You're sick habitually (\"habitual mente\"). You I kept saying, 'I am not don't have at all,' I told him, and yet internally, yes I was sick. 176 So then, in order to find out, this 'colono'47 from Peru knew how to make a product they call San Pedro . Others, brothers who were always drunk, have said, 'He set me right' ('\u00c9l me hizo bien'). So he did a treatment for me. And I said the truth, and to this maestro I said, 'Help me, because I am like this, in my home.' And he understood me well, and so he gave me this product to drink. I drank it, and then in the drunkenness of this, many things appeared to me. There it explained to me why I was like this and who harmed me ('me hizo da\u00f1o'), which young man it is, and why he did it. It told me everything, an d I thought, 'Ah, now I get it.' This product, San Pedro, yes, it set me right. If I hadn't drunk that, I wouldn't have had any thought of staying here and living with my husband. I would have left all my babies and gone far away, I don't know where, but t his remedy stopped me. - Was this the sickness, I mean ... - This bother ('molestia'), that I couldn't live well/right, I wasn't loving my husband, it felt ugly to sleep with him, I was looking at other people, like that. But I drank this remedy and I loved my husband again. Now when I find myself fighting with him, it's resolved quickly and I'll be back playing as though nothing happened. And now I don't have any ideas about going far away, of leaving my babies, nothing. This happened to me. In this case th e illness, the 'da\u00f1o,' is alleged to have originated with a young man who seems to have been a spurned lover of Sonia. The 'da\u00f1o' was intended to break up the happy equilibrium of her life and lead her to seek satisfaction elsewhere, such that Sonia's husb that she was 'sick.' Interestingly, the logic of the experience matches what we have seen thus far, even though the used -San Pedro (Latin: pachanoi), native to Andes that contains mes caline - is not indigenous to Shuar practice. Although the story can be likened to a therapeutic 47 Literally 'colonist', the word is used interchangeably with 'mestizo' by Shuar people. 177 psychedelic experience, Shuar ontology situates the causative element outside of Sonia's individual psychology and locates it instead with an enemy alleged to ha ve used magical means to derail her reality. Other into the forest from Shaime, explained that the shamans may load an object with 'mal' s uch that it does not necessarily need to lodge in the body of its victim to cause harm. As with Sonia's experience, Estalin confirms that 'maldad' may aim at sphere. - Yes, [the object] carries the strength of the shaman wh evil ('mal'). Then one starts to become sick. - So would you have to touch it? - No. They would leave it in your house, or somewhere outside, and it does harm in the whole area. It could be buried just a little under the surface of the earth. It does harm to the family and makes couples separate. - Has this ever happened to you? - Five times it has happened to me, when I was living in Libertad. It was a man with a bad spirit ('mal genio') who did it. I think he did it to make my family fight, or to harm my family. Each time it was removed thanks to my brother -in-law. Once, he even used a human bone, placed in a bottle; other times teeth. - So you found these objects? - Yes, teeth and bones. Or sometimes they use the wool of an animal. Once we took away these objects, the sicknesses went away. - And it was causing fights? - It causes fights, it makes you feel terrible, like you cannot stay there. You want to go far 178 away and leave your family. That's how you feel. You feel unhappy. After that, we all decided to move here to get away from it. A similar story was told by Mishell Kantuash, who was the niece of a renowned shaman and lived in Yanua, another interviewee from was regarded as the result of magical interventions against her family that were the product of jealousy at their success. My son doesn't live with me anymore, but I am taking him to see [my uncle] as well. He told me that they've done the 'porquer\u00eda' to him, so I need to take him. He's going to get a treatment from him. - It would be interesting also to see how he treats you r son? Is he sick? [...] Or is it more than he is in with the wrong crowd ('andando en malas cosas')? - He never comes home. He is always going around with his friends. He didn't used to be like that. My uncle given him \"las porquer\u00edas de vid a\",' so that he becomes separated from me. He has practically been made ('hecho') like that, because my son was never like that. He always spent time at home. Now he doesn't listen and he fights with me, and he's always going out. It hurts me a lot becaus e he was never like that. So I am going to take him there tomorrow. - Do you think he will go? - But he has to. Who else could treat him? And if not, it's not going to stop. I'm his mother, and I can have him treated. Anyway, while I'm selling plantains you can go on ahead. - Is your son going to drink nat\u00e9m with your uncle? - Yes. I'm going to make that happen, so that this 'porquer\u00eda' that they have given him is all ejected. 179 So again, drinking ayahuasca is perceived as necessary to cure a 'mal' that h as not made the target physically sick, but has instead created conflict in the immediate personal sphere. There is a contrast here between what many western users of ayahuasca would identify as a psycho -social issue to be resolved on an individual level v ia 'deeper self - and Mishell's view that the disruption of her vision for her family is the result of a negative external influence. 201) her research on differing explanations for negative ayahuasca experiences between the two groups. In the examples offered here, 'maldad' as an the resolution of these issues in the visionary experience, while at the same time encouraging hostility between groups of Shuar people. In this case, it is debatable whether the 'maldad' was directed against Mishell's as underlying motive. The exchange originated mention upcoming visit to the neighbouring town of Churubia: - The thing is, people around here are not so good. I tell you this out of my humanity. I share blood as much with them as with you [i.e. not at all]. And the people there are not as good as we are. There are bad people, I tell you. There are bad people, m ore bad people, and some good people. [...] My son has his enemies here. It's a little Shuar, who I'm talking about. Look, the people in Churubia are dirty. But it's your decision. - I feel like now that I'm in this area [...] So what you're saying is that a person gave your son...something. Why? Why does it have to be that? - That's the law of things. Envy is like that. I'm going to tell you: I am the niece of [a 180 prominent shaman]. And so my cousins and my brothers are not just anyone. They drive cars. They ha ve studied ('Son preparados'). My uncle has money. He travelled to Spain and worked there for 3 -4 months. Then he comes back and lives here for 2 -3 months, then goes back. That's why they want to harm ( 'da\u00f1ar') my son. I know that he will be exactly the same. But my son fell into a trap. In Shuar territory in the twenty -first century, the kind of regular, overt hostilities encountered by Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine people in the 1970s have ceased. However the suppression of feudi ng with the arrival of the Ecuadorian state has quite likely encouraged shamanic attacks as the new primary vector for inter - group aggression, as well as encouraging the attribution of all kinds In such a terrain, the importance of health and medicine is not limited to the resolution of specific physiological symptoms. If ever - present threat of 'maldad' and the envy of others, then it is the role of medicine to continue strengthening human beings whenever they perceive the need for it.48 I have referred to this ontology of health and illness as 'traditional' because it shares documen ted by anthropologists researching decades ago, in a society independent of if not unaffected by the outside world. Michael Harner documented the Shuar practice of vision -seeking and explained its cultural significance in Shipibo and Conibo peoples, who also make use of ayahuasca, health in the general sense of vitality is connoted by the same word as is used to signify willpower and the capacity 'Ar\u00fatam souls,' that of a single ar\u00fatam soul cannot be killed by any form supposed most general sense,' including increasing 'one's intelligence as obtain a second ar\u00fatam cause whatever, including contagious well -being' 208). There is evident then, vision to reveal the details of their visions to ethnographers, we will likely never know whether their visions were operative in generating personal power in the same way as visions are for Shuar people today. What is clear is that twenty -first century Shuar people self -consciously reinterpret their own vision -seeking behaviour in light of this history, recasting the quest for power and protection as violent dominance over others into an understanding of power in a for m more relevant to their current situation. Emblematic of this perception was Wampash, a Shaime and an outspoken member in collective organisation. Now, currently, we are able to attain a spirit so as to achieve maximal power, in th e mayoralties, the provincial government, city councils ('podr\u00edamos lograr un esp\u00edritu para lograr el poder m\u00e1ximo, como en las alcald\u00edas...'). We have been able to attain this dream ('sue\u00f1o'). In contrast, 50 or 60 years ago these things were used to attain ('lograr') spirit and 182 maximum power so that others could not defeat them in war. The ancestry of the Shuar nationality was warlike and vengeful in this sense. As such, they used to use it like this; and presently, we use it to achieve our greatest dreams ('lograr nuestros sue\u00f1os m\u00e1ximos'). Political power is what we speak of now. Without spiritual power ('potencia spiritual') to achieve a politics, we would be nothing these days. The central point here is clear and explicit: just as vision -seeking empowere d and inspired the Shuar of yesteryear to face mortal struggles, today's Shuar people must seek out visions to enable them to succeed in claiming political power in order to survive. In Nangaritza 'cant\u00f3n,' Shuar have won positions in the tiny municipal co uncils, while other former community leaders have gone Pachakutik organisation. Further north in -Santiago, where Shuar are more numerous, the provincial government has been headed by Shuar Walter's hallucinogenic visions in traditional Shuar ontology. The dream or vision is not simply something that is experienced and then informs Shuar people's lives . It is also, in a sense, something that is possessed by the person who has experienced it, as an addition to the person who they previously were. Far from being a flight of fancy, a dream serves as a guiding vision which bearer towards itself as a non -guaranteed concurred that the empowering of hallucinogenic the centrality of visions to emp owering Shuar people in 49 The future of Chumpi's tenure as Pr efect is unclear. He appeal. gives luck, any kind of luck: to have a longer life, to have more strength, to be able to have disputes with friends or enemies . It's for and lawyers do. [...] This is the bravery of the Shuar. When one comes to argue with you, they will feel cowardly and go away. This is the strength that we have, from 'guantu'. These comme nts are implicitly addressed toward refuting the idea that datura is only consumed by those who are preparing to fight and kill. As such, Fernando is reclaiming their legitimacy for the world faced by Shuar people in the twenty -first century. In his interv iew, conducted in Yanua, Wilson Kayuk put forward the same idea. Doing that, it gives you power. You can become a politician and advance. You could become a president or a philosopher or a doctor and advance in that way. In that way, we develop our inherit ance as Shuar. Again, this is a vision -seeking practice that is separated from this indi vidualistic characteristic of Shuar spiritual practice: - I have one more question if I may. I have noticed that in this town there are no professional shamans. You use nat\u00e9m and you use maikiua , but there are no shamans. - The power is there. You drink nat\u00e9m and that's where the power is. You see your future life and the generation that is going to come to be. One develops one's luck, to become a professional, to learn how to fly international tourist planes and be a pilot, this power, this gives you a luc k. For example, you drink nat\u00e9m and in the midst of this power you can see that you will become a great professional. 184 - Is it the same with nat\u00e9m as with maikiua ? - The same. One learns. You are certain that you are going to become a professional. You are not going to become just any man. Wilson's comments are irresistibly comparable to the impressions noted by Greene of masculine life ideals territory. '[A]ccording to a certain understanding of things,' he to psychede lic plant -derived visions, 'without such a vision a man is just a man, doomed to a fate of lifelong mediocrity and obscurity that many men secretly fear' (2009: 80). To be healthy, then, is not simply to be free of illness; but rather, to be powerful and continual process of realising one's potential. We have seen, then, that for Shuar people in remote regions, the notion of traditional medicine is more expansive a therapeutical model based on the treatment of symptoms in order to return an individual to a state of normal health. To speak of 'medicine' and 'medicinal plants' in the context of Alto Nangaritza is to invoke a range of ideas, some of which correspond more closely to we might which it is tempting to gloss as 'magic'. Shuar people do speak of sorcery, but not as a disconnected or marginal practice but rather as one embedded in relations of power operating a t individual and communal levels well as on cosmic levels sorcery in Nangaritza cannot be reduced to a simple fear of being envied, explained away as the result of an instinct of primitive egalit arianism or anti -capitalism (e.g. Taussig, 1980) that reflects 'widespread anxiety about the production and distribution of wealth,' as the Comaroffs (1999: 288) posit with regard to fears of witchcraft in southern Africa. Instead, the notion of sorcery or 'maldad' is an emanation of an all -encompassing worldview guiding Shuar people in the 185 right way to live, in the context of which 'maldad' can signify physical illness, psycho distress, familial or waylaid from is felt as one's proper path. experiences to maintain a consistent consciousness of the future in their actions in the present represents one way that the promise of epistemic pluralism through state interculturality m ay be realised in the Shuar context. In particular, the notion that one's health and illness have deep roots grounded throughout the entirety of an individual's life and can be plumbed through internally directed hallucinogenic experiences may to the margins of the western political -economic system. The expansion of the system has brough t more and more resources to its centres of knowledge, but at the cost of undermining the viability of independent cultures from which alternate approaches to knowledge may emerge. The ontological and epistemological commitments of Shuar people in Alto Nan garitza and the healing practices emerging from them are but an example of what state interculturality should aim to support. This would of course be to indigenous autonomy over dependence on North -Atlantic forms of political, economic, social and e pistemic organisation. What this chapter has shown, however, is that it would also be desirable for the pluralisation of knowledge production and the functioning of state social services across nation -states as a 186 conceptualisation health and healing any effort to implement culturally representative state healthcare, while at for rich epistemic dialogue. However, such dramatic cultural difference between specific indigenous scientific materialism of state healthcare systems constructed on the model of a modernizing Europ ean state. It also needs to take into account the differences within point as the terms of this project's case study, it is not just when sp eaking of the Shuar population in the province of Zamora -Chinchipe as a whole that we encounter a problematic generalisation, for even in Alto Nangaritza there are minority positions that are clearly distinct from the rest of the population. While the heal th-seeking practices of Shuar people in this particular region are most strongly influenced by the knowledge and practices that are their cultural inheritance as Shuar people, as well as the geographic isolation that has facilitated minority inheritance has been attacked in some ways and transformed in others. The way in which Evangelism has both overcome and combined with existing health -seeking knowledge and practices in Alto Na ngaritza, and the traditional Shuar ontology on which these are dependent, is the subject of the present chapter. It offers both an culturally representative of o ntological metamorphosis worthy of ethnographic analysis in its own 187 right. The manner in which Shuar people navigate between an indigenous animist ontology, an aggressively monotheistic religion and the practice o f state -sponsored clinical healthcare sheds a new light on the similarities and differences between these belief systems. The chapter begins by documenting the character of Evangelism as a worldview, ontological uncertainty highlighted, is way has the capacity to new knowledge guided by criteria of efficacy does not hold in this case. The third section proposes to resolve this problem with the hypothesis represents a halfway position between the philosophical materialism of western science and the ancestral health and traditional this position by explaining how Evangelical religion operates as one vector amongst many in Shuar territory and is only observable in its interactions with existing knowledge practices and with other cultural vectors. and Illness a Crisis of Ontological As detailed in Chapter 3, ten of the sixty -one interviewees in this project were Evangelical, and seven of these lived in and around Shaime in Alto Nangaritza. As that chapter's 188 statistical analysis demonstrated, their strongest predilections were the reje ction of both and engage with healthcare or to prefer the use of medicinal plants was mixed. This chapter seeks to explain these the perspective Evangelicals themselves. It would be easy to account for the rejection of shamans and hallucinogens as Now following the Evangelists, called excess, because it's like a drug. It's not a good thing if you do it when you know what it says in the Bible. For this reason, I have left those things behind. However, giv en that the number of people adhering to the tenets of Evangelism is much lower than the number of people amongst whom the same ideas circulate, it is worth analysing the way in which Evangelical ideas have managed to take root. In studying health -seeking behaviours, one gains a direct window into the way in which the point of crisis represented by serious illness creates leverage for conversion between belief systems. A pre -conversion episode in the life of Antonio Tukupi, recounted after an Evange lical service outside Shaime, is an example of this process: Before I came to know Jesus Christ, I travelled around, and I thought that these people [shamans], through all of their sorceries and witchcraft ('brujer\u00edas y hechicer\u00edas'), were working on the side of God. One day, some sort of 'maldad' entered my daughter and made her sick. And they did so many things that they called treatments, things that only they understood, but they couldn't cure, and I was spending money too. I had to spend money to be a ble to save my daughter. - They charge a fair bit, no? 189 - They charge a lot, and there are some who lie, and they say things that are completely satanic and they go around robbing and taking people's money. These 'brujos' take money from those who are the poorest. There are 'brujos' who go around saying, 'You are not going to be cured; you are going to die. You need this remedy.' And then they take them for [USD] $500 or $1,000. So what happened? My well. I took her to a 'brujo.' He wa s too much. He knew everything! But even he could not make my daughter healthy. - Did you go to see a lot of healers? - Yes. I went to one in Macas, Puyo, El Pangui, so many, so I know. - And did they give you a lot of different explanations? - Yes. They would say, 'Oh, it's your fellow human beings, they're killing her,' or whatever, in that way that they speak. But in the end, my daughter couldn't be cured and she died, and went to another place, perhaps. So I set myself to thinking a lo t. I had been rejecting the word of God at this time. I was Catholic at this point. And I fell into conversation with a priest during this time. And I learned the words, 'He who believes in me will no longer be condemned by God. And he who does not believe is condemned. And when you don't have money coming from anywhere, call out to me and I will answer you.' And so I was thinking and analysing everything during this time. And it says as well, 'With prayer, your sick will be cured.' So if God had died for my sin, why should I believe in a man who is just as sinful as I am [i.e. a shaman]? So I prayed to the Lord: \"Lord, now on I will these are simply go around r obbing money.\" Jesus Christ healed and he never charged a cent! St John the Baptist baptised and never charged anything for it. 190 But the 'brujos' go around, and even just for a consultation they charge $5. If there are two of you, they charge $10. They rob a lot of money. I had paid $150! They lie, they charge you and they take your money. So in 'brujer\u00edas' I won't believe anything. I have left this behind and I'm in the hands of the Lord. Antonio's testimony illustrates the impact of the vagaries of sicknes and health on individuals' fundamental beliefs. his daughter's fatal illness, with shamans and the intoxicating substances of which they make use. However, it seems that if even one of the many shamans whom Antonio visited had managed to to Evangelism from Catholicism would never have taken place. It is a classic example of the role of illness as an intimate mystery that ser ves to foreground our inability to exercise control over even that which is most central to our existence. As Jean Comaroff (1982: 51) puts it, the paradox of illness is that our bodies become both self and other. In the context of a region of Shuar settle ment health and shamanic healing, the health -seeking of Evangelicals be as a dissident reaction to its inevitabl e failings. While illness has the potential to trigger such moments of crisis, its tendency toward - apogee of the pastor's performance arrived in a recount of his own experience of severe illness. I went to see the shamans, and they said that they had the medicine to cure me. However these were simply sedatives ('calmantes'). I was given a and it exactly as I was supposed to. However, my body reacted and got even worse. I threw it away and said, 'This 191 is garbage. From now on, I am only going to believe in God.' And the miracle happened right then. I was cured right away. My illness we nt away. Yet God reprehended me at the same time, and I was forced to stay in bed. During this time, I saw two angels. During my time as a Catholic, I never saw angels. And these angels were wearing such white clothes. The white that we see people wearing cannot be compared to what I saw. I heard the voice of the angels. They walked up to me and touched me. One said, 'Lift up this sick person who is in bed.' In the Catholic religion, they say that God will not speak to you, but I learned that he does. Inter estingly, the pastor used the very same term, 'calmantes', in his dismissal of the healing capacities of shamans as the majority of Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza do in expressing their skepticism with regard to clinical medicine. It is as though, whether for Catholics or Evangelicals, the expectation for to be considered as founded on truth implies that the treatment is able to go immediately to the core of the than simply improve the pastor thereby challenges the legitimacy of shamanism and reinforces that of his own preferred alternative by claiming that prayer and submission to God have greater power over the never -quite -knowable terrain of our bodies. In th is case, then, cultural change is certainly dependent on the slow diffusion of ideas via the global network of Protestant Evangelism, but is effected by a health crisis and the lack of efficacy of the previously preferred form of healing practice. In - Malamud's (1991) thesis that medical decisions are made for political reasons and as assertions of identity, in this case a political decision and an attendant shift in identity occurs for a medical reason. The fraught pe riod surrounding a search for healing can be compared to the moment of observation in quantum physics, when one option 192 pre-existing set of possibilities is finally concretised. In this sense, health -seeking behaviour is one way in which cultural ch ange is made manifest. However, although -Chinchipe is not, precisely speaking, one of knowledge systems in direct competition. As was occurring a century ago with the arrival of Catholic missionaries in Shuar ancestral territory, cultures and their foundational premises inevitably enter a dialogue out of which at least within the theatre in question, neither remains unchanged.50 In today's ontologic al encounter, the Shuar people is coloured by their historically imbued expectation that the paramount form of truth is the transcendental experience of vision. The importance of visions to Evangelical Shuar was one of the curious facts that emerged in the statistical analysis of interviewees' responses, as presented in Chapter 3, and it remains spite the virulent expressions of most outspoken Evangelists in this regard was Elsa Tukupi, a middle -aged grandmother who lived an hour's up the Nangaritza River from Shaime. Elsa described a personal experience of sic kness and healing as follows: A spirit of the world ('esp\u00edritu del I was already on the path of being Evangelical at this time. So what could I do? The only thing I could do w as cast my gaze up to God in heaven, praying and fasting. Then, in a dream, a 'Se\u00f1or' arrived, just like yourself [a white sealed but always part of multiple engagements' (2012: 366). 193 and everything. He appeared to me and said that he was an Evangelist. He spoke to me and made exhortations. 'I am an Evangelist,' he was saying. 'I am the one who heals the sick. I don't heal with remedies, with anything.' And as he made these exhortations, I was struck down by a powerful wind. This cleansed me, via this dream. And after this, pah! , I awoke. My head had been hurting me: my head, body, belly, everything. Then, nothing! I didn't feel any pain at all when I up. the pain left me. Elsa's account might permeation of the subconscious with the imagery of power of the ex ternal world. Just as for the Evangelical pastor, the arbitrary idea of whiteness as a transcendentally element experience of catharsis that occurred during a health crisis. A vision Estalin a Catholic, after ingesting datura, No, drank [datura] when I was injured here [indicating his foot] and it cured me. In dreams I saw doctors coming to help me and the next day I woke up healthy. - You applied it to your skin [also]? - Yes, on the skin. That's how I was cured. - What were the doctors like, that you saw? - They were white people and they came here and cured me. - Were they white men like me? - Yes, that is how they were. They were the force ('fuerza') of the plant, that is to say the spirit ('esp\u00edritu') of the plant, which came and cured me. By the second day I was cured. - And it was a bad injury? When you did it, could you walk? - Yes it was. I couldn't walk. And with this plant I was cure d. 194 Thus, despite their diverging visions were very similar. The principal difference lies in the character of their saviours: Estalin's were identifia ble beings and cohabitants in his own world, who can be easily located as the spirit of a specific plant even as they took on the form of doctors in order to heal. Datura is widely referred to as 'the doctor' by throughout the province. By Elsa's remained when asks rhetorically, 'What could I obvious recourse upon suffering 'maldad' would be to seek treatment from a shaman, if only she had not already distanced herself from their practice by converting to Evangelism. What this means is that, in contrast to the motivat ions that appeared to guide Antonio, rejection of by Evangelists not a sham. based on more complex grounds dismissing the efficacy of their practice. 'False Miracles': Evangelism as a Moral Epistemology? We Evangelicals commonly These terms in and of themselves, however, read as a base condemnation o f evil that fails to do justice to the complexity of Evangelicals' contentions about the nature of shamanic healing. I asked the Shuar Evangelical pastor about shamans' claim that they heal in collaboration with God, he responded as follows: 195 - No! Be fore, we used to believe this, but it does not say this in the Bible. Jesus says nothing about this. My sister, who has now been converted to Christ, she was performing this type of 'magia.' She tells about how Satan was using her as an instrument. And she would tell about how she would touch a sick person and they would be cured. But these are false miracles. Through false powers and Satan, many people are cured. And for want of reading the Bible, people get confused. It's certain to them. They are convinc ed. But for those of us who have read the Bible, we realise that this is not the case. - So you're saying that they can cure through Satan? - Yes. Satan performs miracles. However, they are false. God himself cures. I myself have been cured by God. So ev en though Evangelicals justify their sense of the legitimacy of the Biblical God on stories of divine intervention to heal the sick, they are not dismissing shamanism by arguing shamanic healing is somehow wrong or 'false' in some other way. This may seem incoherent, but the key is to accept that it is founded upon a distinct sort of epistemology to that which is intuitively logical to a secular western audience. Instead of judging the validity of a belief b ased on its to and be consistent with observation, without heeding ethical considerations, some Shuar people evidently have broader set of criteria to judge a belief's legitimacy; or, more to the point, its desirability. The following pa ssage in an interview which involved both Martina and Elsa Tukupi offers a glimpse of these criteria. When I asked thoughts on Shuar ancestral beliefs, Martina replied as follows, with Elsa in agreement: This power [ Ar\u00fatam ] was Satanic. It was not f rom God. Our grandparents had the custom of going to the waterfall; they inhaled tobacco juice through their nostrils; they slept in the forest, at the waterfall. They wanted to catch a spirit ('coger un esp\u00edritu') and see God, as they 196 thought. In this dru nkenness ('borrachera'), they found power. say, 'I encountered a jaguar, which presented itself to me, but I mastered it. It transformed into a person and spoke to me, so that I may live and so that I may kill my enemy. And now I am very certain /safe (\"seguro\") because I have to kill and nobody can kill me.' This power that they attained was not a power from God. It was a power of the Devil. So the people were very confused, because they called Ar\u00fatam God. But God does not say, 'Kill your brother .' The two women's interpretation is consistent with that of the pastor in the sense that they do not dispute the veracity of the practice they criticise: in this case, that of finding vision and power by ingesting hallucinogenic plants by a waterfall in the manner of parents and grandparents. They criticise it on the grounds of moral desirability, not ontological legitimacy. This position does not change when killing is taken out of the equation; as the pastor's testimony makes clear, even healing the s ick can go against their version of Biblical morality. These examples in fact call of comparative study of epistemologies itself: if there is no universal cross -cultural commitment to obtaining knowledge about reality that is unqu alified with moral concerns, how meaningful is it to speak of epistemologies in the plural? One way apparent paradox is that Protestant Evangelism demands a particular way for human beings to relate to the experience of transcending t he ordinarily apparent layer of reality. There appears to be a demand for the abnegation of spiritual agency in the way in which certain spiritual practices are either favoured or held in disrepute. one is expected to adopt whe n exercising the Evangelical beliefs: prayer. According to Elsa Tukupi: 197 I always tell my sisters, 'When you need to be cured, go first to God.' Because the Bible says the 'maldad' that enters your body can only be r emoved by fasting and praying. One has to pray. It is the same with the head of the church. He has to pray. It's not that he as a person is capable of curing on his own; rather, through this person the prayer to God comes back down from heaven and heals. I t removes the illness. But when one doesn't have faith, one cannot be healed. For this reason, one must have faith in God. This is also an opportunity for you, because all of us need God in our lives. What is notable here is the organisation of both an ega litarianism and a hierarchy in spiritual worth. An Evangelical pastor, or any kind of 'head of the church,' is not situated in a superior position to others with respect to spiritual agency, as represented in the Manichean quest for health and the banishme nt of illness.51 At the same time, this equality is the product of a permanent hierarchy of spiritual power with respect to God, the one and only morally legitimate force beyond the normally visible world. The limit of human spiritual agency is to petition God to heal, according to the Evangelicals, from a position of supplication and faith. Even then, God may legitimately toy with human hopes; as the pastor related, 'Sometimes, God tests a man by sending him sickness. And through this illness, God disciplin es, in order to know if God is in his heart.' Thus, while not contesting the ontological veracity of other forces of healing which originate on normally invisible planes of reality, Evangelism establishes a very different, subordinate form of ideal human subjectivity with respect to such forces than does traditional and practices in Evangelism's 'epistemology,' so to 51 Evangelical pastor stressed 'the Bible ethical concerns about the hierarchical order of the universe and the degree to which humankind should express its full capacities. A similar finding on the hierarchy of legitimate agency in Evangelical thought can be found in out among in New Marshall community are spirituality, engagement with spirits existing on -ordinary was governed norms of reciprocity' (2015: 405). This difference that between Shuar Evangelicals and the Shuar Catholics living according to a more traditional worldview. The former make petitions to an unknowable God, while the latter refer to vision -inducing medicinal plants as having 'a spirit' and as plants which 'cannot be collected just for the sake of them.' In the same vein, Navajo Evangelicals consider 'all good things in life' as 'blessings' which are received as 'gifts from God in response to petitions' (2015: From a tra ditional Navajo by 'a state of blessedness is responsibility maintain. It is the result of proper functioning of the world, which was set up in ancient times, and can be restored through ritual' (2015: 406). Though such notions of ritual the past are absent in the individualistic practices of Shuar spirituality, as we seen in Chapter 4 such ideals as virtue, strength, good fortune achieved by fearlessly pursu these ideals, while have moral are more valued as guideposts to the most effective way to live and prosper. Shuar Evangelicals, on the othe r hand, speak incessantly 199 of 'faith,' which is the explanation for good fortune and the required response to adversity; and are at times more concerned with the purity of their souls in the afterlife than they are with the effectiveness of their actions in the present. Medicinal Plants, Materialism and the Disowning of Spiritual Agency recourse except prayer. Almost all of the Evangelical s with whom I spoke supported the use of medicinal plants. For some, this was a matter of cultural pride and asserting indigenous identity, a subject to be addressed in Chapter 7. For others, treatment of illness with medicinal plants was seen as according with the intention of God in placing such plants on the Earth, as the Evangelical pastor and his wife confirmed. (These two positions was also evident in Kiim, a small town built around a church in which there were no shamans present. As one woman living there who was very knowledgeable about medicinal plants put it: 'Never say that I am a witch -doctor (\"bruja\") or that I am a shaman (\"curandera\"). Behind me, there is someone who intercedes on my behalf. There is the Lord, who left us the medicinal plants, then there is me.' The way in which Evangelicals relate to hallucinogenic plants is revealing of the way in which medicinal plants and healing in general are situated in Evangelicals' worldview, therapeutic characteristics independent of Again, Martina and Elsa Tukupi's interview brought the matter to light most nat\u00e9m , tsaank , and maikiua ? - We do not do this. Well...simply as remedies, yes. When one has a wound, to simply apply it [ maikiua ], then yes, but not... M - For injuries, it can be applied. E - For fever, one can also take the leaves of nat\u00e9m and bathe with them [the leaves are mixed with water in a bucket, which is then used to bathe]. Q - But they are not used for acquiring power from visions? M - No. E - This power from visions can only be given by God. Q - Through prayer, for example? E - For example, for myself, God has made me see. If I have a brother who is not walking in the path of Christ, God sends me a vision to show me. So then, I have to speak with him, and tell him, 'God is saying that you are going in this direction, and you are putting yourself in danger. You need to take more care.' If God gives a vision, it lives. In other words, these plants with the capacity to provoke a spiritual or vis ionary experience have characteristic specifically neglected by Evangelicals only those phytochemical properties that affect the body. They did not consider that the plants could either explain the nature of an illness to th em, as non - Evangelicals residents of Shaime say with regard to ayahuasca; nor did they consider that one should drink datura in order to experience healing at the hands of the spirit of that plant (the so -called 'doctor'). Evangelical healing preferences t hus manifested a Cartesian logic. For them, God is the only legitimate source of the transcendent knowledge that emerges from the layers of reality beyond the ordinarily visible world; practices that imply the intelligence, agency or intentionality of any other entity on these levels of reality are to be opposed as moral perversions, despite their potential efficacy. 201 As such, it appears be the nature monotheism of Evangelicals serves as a halfway point between philosophical materialism and the animated cosmos of indigenous Shuar ontology. majority practice in Alto Nangaritza of communicating with beings that exist beyond the normally visible plane of reality is even more rabidly opposed by Shuar Evangelicals than with the calm agnosticism of the latter with regard to Shuar healing practices as a whole. In the words of one of the regular doctors at the clinic in Shaime, 'We can hardly tell them not to use their own medicine. It's not as though we have studies to say that the plants they use don't work.' By contrast, seeing ordinary invisible layers of reality as real, t hey become all the more frightening to Evangelicals, the singularity of God as demonic emanations of Satan. In such a worldview, one is left with simply the works of the Creator an d humankind, to whom Creation was left to be shepherded.52 Given that the other elements of the world have no agency, personality or individuality of their own, they can be classified and manipulated according to their universal qualities and natural laws, with only the additional element of faith in the Creator himself required to activate them in the sought -after direction. With humankind left to its own devices between a distant God 52 This argument relating the western will to dominate nature has also been developed by Kichwa intellectual Luis Maldonado Ruiz (2010: 84). 202 and the materiality of the world, it is just one step further to do away with the element of faith altogether, putting man's knowledge of the Creation in the place of the will of the Creator as the prime mover. In this historical trajectory, Evangelism among Shuar people appears to be functioning in the same fashion as Protesta ntism in early -modern Britain, which disciplined folk religious practices delegitimising minor and direct revelation (Green Musselman, 2006: 147 -8). Ironically, then, it is possible that the spiritual practice of Evangelism does more to overhaul the An indication of this Chinchipe, raised caused by of would 'naturally from clinical personnel. The association of God with what we could recognise as a 'natural causes' explanation is encouraging active interventions on the material world combined only with passive spiritual supplic ation. 203 There is also historical for proposition. In encountered by Philippe Descola and Anne -Christine Taylor in the late 1970s, it would appear that not just the name but the entire category of 'sicknesses of Descola observed, 'My have hardly any there being \"natural causes\" for pain or misfortune. Instead, they u sually consider them to stem from the actions of others, either involuntary or deliberate' (1996: 235). With regard to the of medicinal plants, the most favoured aspect of in it is worth noting, to the mythical image of the Indians of Amazonia promoted by of \"alternative medicine\"' 237). that at least for Jivaroan peoples, the will to use and learn about a diverse range of medicinal plants has in some ways been encouraged by missionisation53 and Evangelism, as well as by the presence of indigenous identity politics. One Vector Amongst Many The Zamora -Chinchipe should not be exaggerated, as Evangelism is but one of several cultural vectors that are influencing the worldview and practice of Shuar people. Even amongst Evangelicals, it should not be assumed that the hold of their ideas is total; that the cultural presuppositions they have inherited as Shuar people are 53 A definite exception is me had been explicitly condemned by a priest during her adolescence. 204 being erased; or that they are not being simultaneously affected by other cultural vectors. On the first point, testimony of Elsa T manifested certain she accepted. In her words: My son too [...], he got very ill as well. I suffered for him. Due to my disobedience, my father in heaven has taken six of my gra ndchildren away from me. So I prayed to him: 'Father, please don't take any more grandchildren away from me. He is the only one you have left me. The others that you took away, you have them now. But leave him here with me.' So I fasted, and when I slept I saw my grandchild with a needle inside him, tied around with a black thread. So I said to my daughter, 'Why does he have this needle inside of him? Why did you put this inside of him?' So I sucked it out of my grandson. And she said to me, 'This was put t here by \"magia\"'. This means that he was affected by bad spirits of the world. Once I took it out, my grandson was fine. And so I continued to pray and make requests to God. In the name of God, we can make treatments, using some remedies and praying to hi m. This description of a case of illness and healing is nearly by non -Evangelical Shuar. The only difference is that in the latter case the diagnostic vision would be received by under the of nat\u00e9m , rather than in a dream prayer fasting in supplication before God. Aside from that aspect, perceiving a small, otherwise innocuous item lodged in the body of a patient, which is attributed as the cause of the illness and the instrument of an unknown, us, 'When you need to be cured, go first to God. The Bible says that the badness that enter s your body can only be removed by fasting and praying.' without the need for medicines has evidently become mixed up 205 with the notion of petitioning God to be healed, s o as to suggest that following such supplication one can heal others impact of culturally inherited responses of Evangelicals, so is the impression made by other cultural vectors, of which the most prominent are the mining economy and the discourse associated with the Pachakutik party and the broader global ideology of indigenous rights and the re -assertion indigenous identity. An\u00edbal Tseremp, a waged town of Churubia, stated directly, 'We go to the doctor for any kind of illness.' When pressed on whether 3, among Evangelicals in Shaime there was deep suspicion of state health clinics; one of the men insisted that the injecti ons and serums used were designed alike who would inveigh against non -native foods as the cause of much of the illness suffered by Shuar people, while invoking the diet and healing practices of their ancestors as a model health healing in of modality indicating their terrain on which their impact is focused. In the case of Evangelism, its terrain is ontological: it brings a activities positive may be condemned on This was apparent in the Evangelical pastor's opposition to ' succeed in healing their 206 illustrative example. When experiences with ayahuasca, An\u00edbal related the following: - Did you just d rink it out of curiosity? - Yes. People said it was very good. One sees visions and I wanted to see too, to see if it was true, a sort of experiment. It is true, what they say. You see visions on a screen, the things that are going to happen and that have to happen. When one sees something, it becomes true [later]. It is true. That's what I can tell you. Yet despite attributing this fantastical quality to the plant, An\u00edbal was nevertheless opposed to the use of it. As we saw earlier in this chapter, he ha d decided that '[i]t's not a good thing if you do it when you know what it says in the Bible.' At the same time, despite its impact on ontological terrain, when it comes to the terrain of relations with the outside world and the organisation of time and labour, Evangelism leaves such matters essentially untouched. As such, it to o Evangelism in terms as colonialism Evangelism is significant complication to any project of state intercultural healthcare in Shuar territory because of the moral invective it reserves for practices and beliefs that are fundamental to traditional Shuar health -seeking behaviour. Its reach can be understood because of the leverage it finds among Shuar people who have experienced suffering and loss and seek a means to express a dissident response to the traditional ontol ogy and practices that ought to have As such, there an oppositional stance inherent in their worldview that suggests there little potential for articulating their health -seeking preferences in shared Cath olic in geographically remote regions. 207 In sum, the Evangelical presence would need to be considered by any intercultural health initiative undertaken in Shuar territory. Healthcare institutions of Shuar people living in remote regions could not be said to be culturally representative of Evangelical Shuar. At the same time, preferences are essentially oppositional; with their emphasis administe herbal or pharmaceutical medicinal agents in conjunction with supplication before God, Evangelicals are not substantially different from mestizo Ecuadorians and other westerners in the kind of medical expertise they expect and require. This perspectiv e is driven, as we have seen, by Evangelism as a response to failures against shamanism and all forms of agency on the plane of non -ordinary levels of reality, which are seen as th e proper domain of God. In picturing the world as a material plane ruled over by a distant, singular deity, Evangelists are in fact only a small step from of philosophical As state healthcare institutions along intercultural lines, although they could be education, socialisation and self -development on the part of Shuar - controlled intercultural state health institutions. By the same token, there are other regions of Shuar territory where geographic isolation and the ancestral Shuar cultural inheritance are not as significant as in Alto Nangaritza, and where the political an d economic vectors that exert influence may find greater compatibility virtue pre -existing fields, Michael Taussig was more ready than most anthropologists before its profound dependence on the magic of style to make this trick of truth work' (1987: 37). It is a fact worth drawing attention to here as well, in the aftermath of two chapters synthesised primarily from the accounts of Shuar residents of th e beautiful and remote Upper Nangaritza Basin. Social science, like any human includ es a love of 'nature,' adventure and the challenge of going 'off -the-grid.' Such research sites may provide a more rewarding the study of cultural, and epistemological than the minutiae western However, very to nature and phone reception so awareness of this unfortunate fact and its role in the present study that drove the move in ethnographic location from Alto Nangaritza to the Quimi River Valley, to the north of the Ecuadorian province of Zamora -Chinchipe (see Figure 1). From one o f the most geographically and culturally remote regions of the country, where few residents had mastered Spanish, the focus shifted to an area where the money economy took 209 precedence over the subsistence economy, where only those over the age of forty spok e the Shuar language and where it was not uncommon to see satellite TV dishes on the rooves of indigenous peoples' homes. There are two Shuar 'centros' in the valley: Yanua, a settlement made up of a single extended family with a population of about fifty ; and Churubia, a legally singular 'centro' with three separate nuclei and a population of around 95 individuals, some 30 minutes' walk further up the valley. The present research includes 28 interviewees from the valley, 12 of whom were waged miners and a nother five of whom were 'artisan' miners. Of the 28, 14 were residents of Yanua and 14 were residents of Churubia. The difference in the pattern of responses between the waged miners and the other interviewees -particular those few not involved in any sort of mining -was very obvious; in terms of behaviours, most of the latter seemed to bear more in common with residents of Alto Nangaritza than with their own neighbours. The socio -cultural terrain of the Quimi Valley is shaped by the Mirador mine, a so -called 'mega -project' of socialist development which busloads of workers would roll in before dawn and leave in the afternoon, along with the Chinese and Ecuadorian engineers and translators who arrived and left in pick -up trucks on their own schedule. All of this traffic relied on a road of pressed clay and gravel a lane and a half wide, which in turn relied on an 80 metre -long, two -lane wide concrete bridge built over the Zamora River in 201 1. Although the mine was dependent on this labour force bussed in from elsewhere in the province, it also drew substantial involvement from local Shuar and mestizo men. As stated in Chapter 3, miners were paid working -on/15 days -off 210 schedule. On workdays, they would leave home in the morning and return some 10 hours later, after completing the 90 -minute round -trip to the mine on foot. This schedule allowed the men to make a l iving wage with ample time off, and on leisure, 'artisan' mining and maintaining where their wives grew plantains and cassava near their homes. Although most households some sort of garden, mining households p rimarily consumed store -bought fish. 8: bridge on road Those who extended themselves into 'artisan' mining enjoyed an even stronger economic position , albeit without the protection of the law. Though of involved, 'artisan' miners reported being able to collect a gram of gold in one to two hours, 211 which at 2014 prices equated to approximately USD $150 -$300 of to major cities to sell their product (trips which The economic prospects offered by mining are very fortunate for the current generation of young Shuar families of the Quimi Val ley in light of the Balkanisation of their ancestral territory caused by mestizo colonisation.

In explain divergence in health -seeking practices between Shuar miners in the Quimi River Valley and the Shuar of Alto Nangaritza, the present chapter aims to present a more empirically grounded and 54 My concern groups of whole and entire world four -narratives' (2005b: 123), than with presented in Chapter 3 as the point of departure, this first vision practices, stand in contradistinction both to anthropology's skepticism of shamanism as a knowledge practice and to romanticised invocations of indigene ity as a contemporary subjectivity. then moves into a consideration of the prevalence of medicinal plant usage, the analysis of which illustrates the interplay of the coercive power of macro the complexity reforming state institutions in the direction of cultural representativeness; and about the uneven necessity to do so in light of the impacts of varying material and discursive regimes. 214 Figur e House Shuar sorcery and vision and treatments, his wife Genesis Kayap said, 'I don't even know is.' Another miner, An\u00edbal Tseremp, replied, 'I'm Evangelical, for the last 12 years. I practise what it says in the Bible. So I've left behind everything to do with shamans and \"curanderos\".' As mentioned in Chapter 3, when Norma Tsakimp was asked whether she had sought out a shaman for a case of 'maldad' or any other reason, she responded, 'I've never believed in such things.' Mateo Tsakimp 'Look, for us, we don't have this belief. I have a girl who is 12 years old now, and she's never got sick with \"mal illnesses I was young, I drank [ayahuasca] with my late father. He was a good 'cur andero'. His healings were holy remedies.

It when one passes the 'mal' to another person. But I don't know how that could be. I cannot believe it. For his part, Gilbert Tsakimp, the young 'artisan' miner, suggested, 'I would say that ten percent of young people n ow believe in shamanism.' As related in Chapter 3, just two of the twelve waged miners interviewed said that they would consult a shaman of illness (five of when including 'artisan' miners). Some consensus among interviewees in the Quimi River Valley reassuring. Rorty put it paradigmatically, 'Western liberal intellectuals should accept the fact seriously' ( 29). typically not taken seriously, its undeniable existence as a social phenomenon has established it as a central problem to be explained away in the description and analysis of non -western societies. Thus we ha ve early patients; he colonial differentiation such that magic became a gathering point for Otherness in a series of racial and class differentiations' (1987: 465); and currently performance and 'narrative' easily differently. At least in speaking of ayahuasca shamanism in western Amazonia, there is significant coherence between practitioners in terms of both what they say they do and how they say they do it: specifically, that under the effects of ayahuasca, they are able to 'see' the illness and the part of the patient's body affected, and from there seek shamans' the myriad of intuitions and observations made by a shaman about a patient may crystallise for the 55 Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kelly describes the 'yopo' visual impression of latter. 4), willing to ape in an attempt from th e desperate; at least, this was a common perception in Zamora -Chinchipe. In the previous chapter, we heard how Antonio Tukupi was parted from his money in his desperation to see his offspring cured. With respect to shamanic apprenticeships, Franklin Kayap of Yanua told me, 'There are many who do this just to study how the other man does it, then they copy him and steal money.' He attributed this to the of a true shamanic apprenticeship, which at least according to Franklin could be expected to last 'six to twelve years.' That said, the possibility in itself of perpetrating such a swindle medicine and herb alism. It should not be so hard, then, for social researchers to accept a degree of efficacy in Amazonian shamanic healing, and the reflexive focus on is certainly shamans further witness to the need to ask this question. 218 First -Hand A ccounts of Shamanic Healing The a -aged of Churubia wife of an 'artisan' miner. Sometimes one has tumours on the inside, in the organs: for example, cysts, stones, tumours. This is why people get operations. One can also go to a shaman for these things, but the shamans of today cannot cure them. That's why one has to go for an operation. But then, we often distrust these people [medical personnel]. I went for treatment for a calculus on the bone and I was sent to this hospital, then this doctor, then another city, but they could not do anything for me. They wanted to take the bone out, but I didn't want them to. I thought, 'It can't be right that I am fine and healthy all my life, and now this.' So perhaps there is a shaman -doctor ('medico -cham\u00e1n'); let's try it out. Let's try everything else first. So I came back from Cuenca and started to look for a good shaman who could examine me. What happened? The shaman said that I didn 't have a calculus; that it was something else, a different disease that the shaman could cure. So I was cleansed three times [over three nights] and this round lump that I had disappeared, and to this day, I give thanks to God, and I have not been for any more treatments. After just the second cleansing, the lump was going down, and the shaman said that that meant it must have been swelling rather than had any problems. I was speaking to a friend who said that the swelling could have originated in the liver, so I'm going to go to the doctor to request an ultrasound to find out. At the time, my bones, my ribs and my back were hurting and I couldn't do anything, whereas now I can. I can work, go to other places to visit my friends. I couldn't do this before. I couldn't even stomach food. I was getting very skinny, and I'd never been like that before. So that is 219 what I can tell you. Sometimes, because we do not believe in the shamans, we go to a doctor. But if I hadn't gone to a shaman to have him examine me, what would have happened? They would have operated on me, and then who knows? Perhaps I would no longer be able to live here on this land [because of the demands it places on mobility]. - I'm so happy t o hear how it worked out. What was the treatment that the shaman performed on you? Was it just a cleansing, or did he give you some medication? - He gave me a cup of...look, I don't know, something that he prepared. There are more plants and vines than I c an even know about. He gave it to me to drink and told me to drink each day, and said that the pain would go away little by little. And believe me, we had spent [USD] $3,000 already. Then this, which only cost us $100, took away the pain. We were spending money in Cuenca, in Loja, in Gualaquiza where I was hospitalised. There was a doctor in Cuenca who wanted $2,000 for the operation. Then in Gualaquiza they were going to do it for free, and they have excellent technical knowledge in Gualaquiza and receive it from doctors in other countries. Then some doctors said it was a huge calculus and that they could operate on me, but I might not survive. This As Ximena went on to What was the shaman's name? - Fernando Jimpikit. He lives near Gualaquiza. - Does he drink nat\u00e9m when he is diagnosing patients? - Yes. When he drank, he focused on examining just me. When they drink, everything comes to them. Fernando told me that I h ad been done harm ('hecho da\u00f1o') by people around here out of pure envy. My children are studying and my daughter was queen of the parish.56 'It's 56 Ximena is referring to the beauty pageants held annually throughout the region in which local town officials judge young girls, who are often stil l in high -school. 220 because you're a hard -working person and you and your husband have earned plenty of goods,' he said. - Did he tell you who it was specifically? - Only that it was relatives of my husband. That was all. In other words, a diagnosis made by a shaman under the influence of ayahuasca was followed by the provision of a herbal remedy, which effected a rapid cure of th e problem. There is no obligation here to accept that Ximena's affliction was caused by sorcery, or the that shamans able to 'suck' afflictions out of their patients' bodies. At its core, what we see here is an effective cure that av oided the prospect of surgery, with all its attendant complications. The other side of the coin was also in Ximena's testimony, when she related a failed attempt to seek a cure for her son from a shaman: - Had you ever gone to see a shaman before that? - Yes. It was a shaman from Pastaza and he robbed us of $2,000 when my son was sick. He did not even cure my son. - He travelled here? - Yes, he did. My son had a work accident when he was carrying heavy loads at a job near Loja. He had a swelling in his groin and could not urinate. They gave him medications at the hospital, but he just got worse and worse. So we took him out to visit a herbalist -doctor ('medico -naturista') in the city of Loja. This Se\u00f1ora gave him a natural infus ion she had prepared and ten minutes later he was able to urinate. The Se\u00f1ora charged us $6. 221 Matilde Yankuam Matilde is a resident of the small Shuar town of Kiim, in the 'cant\u00f3n' of Yacuambi, though much of her family lives in Alto Nangaritza. Kiim was constructed around a church that formerly had regular services, and Matilde herself was educated at a mission -school, Such was the illness suffered by her son: When my son came to visit us when he was sick, the medications didn't make him any better and in fact he was getting worse. So I asked my it sick ness ('enfermedad') [as opposed to 'maldad'], that he isn't getting better?\" Look, I've never gone into this, but I took my son to do this, to see a shaman ('curandero'). He was of our own race, a witch -doctor ('brujo'), as they say. - Ahah, uwishin . So he looked at my son. He said that he used to work on the other side too, the counterpart of his own race ('contraparte de la raza de \u00e9l'), with the Ministry [sic] of Indigenous Health. Now he works with natural medicines. First he said he had to do tests on him to be able to analyse his illness. He took my son's temperature and his blood pressure. He measured his weight and waistline. Then at night he up Catholic icons at and 'soplada' [blowing perfumed alcohol the \"mal viento\", or \"mal collect 'cariamanga' [a reed -like grass] and came back the same night. On the second day he seemed better, but then that afternoon he turned bad again. The 'curandero' cleaned him. He gave him only natural medicines, all the medicines that we cultivate as part of rescuing our culture. Up to the present day I'm sorry that it was this that 222 cured my son. My son was healed this way, with three cleansings ('limpiezas'). My son always recommends this 'curandero' to other people now, because he didn't get better at all going to the clinics or taking their medications. [...] He was cured in four days of treatments. It is unfortunately unclear in this case whether the shaman relied on an ayahuasca -induced state to diagnose the patient, although it seems quite likely that this was part of his practice, given the wariness toward him felt by Matilde and revea led in her use of the term 'brujo'. There is a curious opposition here in the natural medicine ('the that we cultivate of rescuing our her religiously and Nonetheless, it is clear that his method, the shaman was able to accurately diagnose and resolve a health concern that was not treated satisfactorily local residing Shaime at the time of the present study, recounts an ordeal that finally ended with her properly treated by a Shuar shaman. Estimating her age, the events must have occurred some 45 years ag o. I was 18 years old when I started to get sick. They could not cure me -nothing, nothing. And the nuns said to me -I was at a mission -they said, 'Go and have an operation in Quito.' Well I obliged them and did that. In those days, Ecuador had not 'dollari zed.' I went with my husband to Quito and I saw the nuns. I was in a 'tr\u00e1mite' [making some sort of application to be treated] from Monday until Friday, and then the following Monday, again, for the blood and urine tests. 223 On the Sunday, I saw the nuns and they said, 'Are you visiting?' And I answered, 'Coming from a poor family, how could I just be travelling all the way here? It's because of my health.' And they said, 'What is wrong?' And I said, 'I have a problem with my liver. I have suffered from it fo r years.' 'And what did the doctors tell you? To get an operation? You'll have to do the \"tr\u00e1mite\",' like I was saying. 'You need an operation on your liver. You have liver -stones.' Then the nun said to me -she was a foreigner, like yourself, she was Italia n-and she said, 'They're going to cut your body. Leave behind those natural remedies from your \"Oriente\" [Amazon] and have them cut your body.' The next day, she told me to go back and said, 'I'll take you to the bus station myself. You will get an operati on. Take this money so that you can go by plane...You can have the tests done in Puyo.' And in Puyo it was the same. They said, 'You have to go to Ambato.' If I go there, I thought, then I'll be sent somewhere else, still with the same pain. So I went to Mac as [in Morona -Santiago] and from there back to my house. But I was still feeling the same pain. My liver was swollen. A witch -doctor ('brujo') they him. there, hanging in a hammock. The 'brujo' -he was from Cayam\u00e1 s-and said, 'Take her up to my house so that I can treat her there. Bring a chook and \"aceite unspecific will prepare her my own homemade remedies.' And that is what he did. One night there, he drank nat\u00e9m and he blew (' soplar') using cedar bark. Then the next night, he gave me chicha to drink. Then another night, the last one, he gave me chicha. He also gave me the oil that he had blown over, and he told me to drink chicken broth early the next morning. Then the next day my body started to eject these captains, these bosses [sic], the stones, the rubbish from my body, which had already been formed from the evil ('mal'). - Were you vomiting these up? 224 - No...out the back. I didn't vomit. It was after I drank the oil and the broth. The captain came out and then the small ones, little green things. I went to see him and said, 'It was these things. These were the \"mal\" that was killing me.' 'Very good,' he said. The nuns had told me to leave natural remedies and come and be cut open. And then it was just cost after cost after cost. But after this, my stomach was flat, like there was nothing inside. I felt very well. - Did you eat anything during this time, or was it just nat\u00e9m and chicha that you drank? - I didn't drink nat\u00e9m . Just chicha, chicken broth and the oil. That was how I was cured. The pattern of an ayahuasca -provoked diagnosis and herbal remedy is by now familiar. The twist in this version of the tale is the extreme neglect visited upon a young, poor indigenous woman in 1970s Ecuador, for whom there was evidently no 'right' to adequate healthcare and possible recourse. The Mechanics of Disbelief in the Quimi River Valley For Shuar miners living along the Quimi River, then, shamanic healing is not just an ancestral practice and belief but also a social phenomenon the faith in which is reasonably by accounts of resolution of otherwise intractable health problems. In this case, ho w is it exactly that they disbelieve in and are willing to healing? The in certain situations is not explanation enough, even incapable healing every patient they examine, due to the notion that in order to heal 'maldad', the curing shaman must be more powerful than the sorcerer who originated it. As in the case of v ision -seeking practices in Alto Nangaritza, the responses of the effusive interviewees pointed to a greater degree of complexity, beneath the surface of the misleadingly straightforward on the part of 'not believe in' shamans. Gilbert Tsakimp's interview was a case in point: Yes, but around here in Zamora, they say that the majority of the shamans who make nat\u00e9m don't actually know. But then in Morona -Santiago and Pastaza, where the 'cofanes' and the 'huaoranis'57 live, among them, and I've heard that the best shamans are from the 'cofanes' and the Kichwas, and they can do things that will leave you stunned. Th ey are professionals. This in general to heal, but rather appears to be a more focused critique of the state of knowledge of shamanism amongst Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe. 'We see how people fall into the trap, listening to lies, paying too much money,' said Gilbert. 'If there were true shamans here, we would know them.' belief could pretender in complex opinions on other Amazonian people living further into the forest, whom they tended to view with an ad miration tinged with melancholy resignation that they would never return such a state. Achuar and Shuar as are peoples. 226 comparison with the 'hard' and 'resistant' nature of the Peruvian Shuar and Aguaruna, who live in more remote Luc io and Mateo Tsakimp when they said, 'There is nothing of that here anymore,' with respect to what they would consider true shamans 'who know how to cure.' Their counterpoint was not a distant Amazonian group but in fact their own grandfather, who they sai d 'was very good at healing,' who 'could convert himself into a tiger [jaguar], or a boa,' and who 'could even call the peccaries, so they wouldn't stay a long way away.' As we saw earlier, too, Jes\u00fas Tankamash said that he could not believe in shamanism, but nonetheless considered that his father's time and distance serve twenty -first century Shuar in Zamora themselves leverage This of and spatial distance, according to Hale, 'creat[ed] a powerful composite image of the racializ ed Other' which was fundamental to Latin republics' narratives of progress through mestizaje (2004: 17). In both cases, what we see is an example of what Michael Taussig called the 'imputations of magic in Otherness', for 'wherever (1987: 179): elsewhere, we might add, in time or in space. For Taussig, it was this 'magic in Otherness' on which shamanism was dependent. shamanism the region, Taussig already flown the coop, as it were, in terms of relevance of his argument to contexts where shamanism exists as an endogenous social phenomenon and 227 knowledge practice. It is indeed true that in many cases shamans' reputations are enhanced by association with the exotic: whether in the form of the Orientalist fantasies tourists (Ainsworth, 2014: 35 -36) or the ideals of Indian -ness in mestizo society, in one direction; or the invocations of biomedical symbolism (Greene, 1998: clientele.58 Yet underlying this, there remains an elegance to the treatment practice of shamans who examine t heir patients and reach their diagnosis under the influence of ayahuasca and prescribe medicinal plant remedies on that basis. The ongoing practice of such a mode of shamanic healing in wholly Shuar contexts, without the need performative gestures and a symbolic repertoire, belies the notion is dependent on the complex of interethnic social relations in which it is often located. embedded may function to discount its across contexts. For Shuar it is this explaining away (by loc ating it at a temporal, geographic or cultural distance) of shamanism, and the subsequent conceptualisation of and therefore impossible for oneself to practise, that is the very nature of disbelief when faced with th e other power are more located in past of the Quimi River Valley, the ethno -cultural di fference of Cof\u00e1n people, or the geographical of Alto Nangaritza -it is the attribution of or believability as dependent on that distance which constitutes the act of disbelieving, sort of ontological expansionism that serves to const ruct a frontier of plausibility and situate the practice in question on the other side. The millennial generation of Quimi Valley Shuar residents sit on the edge of this frontier, from which medical scientists, public policy analysts and other adherents indigeneity appears to Shuar people in the waged economy, in the way it is set against the ideal of economic progress with which Shuar miners have come to identify. Ironically, in explaining performance, anthropologists have contributed to of this of disbelief -via- distancing which is now being internalised by some Shuar people as they adopt a modern subjectivity. Distancing Oneself from Vision -induced visions among miners in the Quimi Valley was similar to their perception of shamanic healing. There was little offered by Jes\u00fas Tankamash put it: 229 My grandparents have lived here shamans. However today, excuse me wh en I say this, but I don't believe. The power from those times was very different. Think about 'guantu' [datura], for example. They drank this so that they could attain power. This is a powerful remedy. On the other hand, I am Catholic and very religious. I believe in God, and this God is much more powerful than any man. For this reason, I do not believe in witchcraft ('brujer\u00edas') or that shamans can cure. Our God is the best doctor. He is the only powerful one who can harm, construct and unmake and end everything. Now my grandparents were also believers in God, but in a different sense. For example, there is also nat\u00e9m . This was the power of God and through this, they saw God. In that way, they received power and the Holy Spirit and they believed themselve s to be powerful and brave. They were stronger than we are today. Today we young people have a lower energy and strength. We don't have visions because we have forgotten the customs of my fathers. Today we don't use these things. Instead, if I have cancer or sore bones, where do I go? To the hospital, the clinic. They apply a serum and remedies that are simply drugs, numbing me,' I have often thought. - In that case, why go to the clinic? - Why? Bec ause we have neglected this practice [that of their grandparents]. At times, we feel lazy towards this. With 'guantu' [datura], the spirit of this is very strong. One has to fast for three days. In one sense, this testimony parallels the beliefs and percep validity of hallucinogenic There is an open recognition that beliefs worked for the ancestors and had positive effects, interviewee still feels need to himself from them. One might speculate that where Evangelicals are seduced by the notion of God, as is the 'very religious' Jes\u00fas, miners are seduced by the 230 notion of progress, in the sense of struggling to reconcile the enjoyment of both ancestral practices of spirituality and the fruits of material and technological advance. An apparently similar dynamic is at work in the thinking of the aforementioned Lucio and Mateo Tsakimp, two brothers who reside in Churubia and are employed at the Mirador mine. When cultura ya no aplicamos'): LT - I drank it once when I was very sick. Q - What was wrong? LT - I fell from a tree, from very high. I had climbed high, two or three branches high at least, and I fell. I was 8 years old. It was 4 o'clock when I fell, but I did not wake up until 8pm that night. My mother prepared 'guantu' and gave it to me the ne xt day. I was cured with this. Q - So you applied it to yourself? LT - Yes, all over, all over. Q - And you drank it as well? LT - Yes, I drank it. It cured me, it cured me. One becomes drunk and then sees how one is being cured. People come to speak to you. 'Guantu' is the doctor who comes to speak with you. It tells the person how they are going to be, how they will be cured. It is like a doctor. It speaks to you through the vision. Q - So you are completely unconscious for a long time after drinking this? LT - Of course: some two or three days unconscious. The drunkenness doesn't just pass. Q - How do you experience this? Is it like sleeping? LT - Yes, it leaves you sleeping ['te deja durmiendo']. But inside, you know everything that you are seeing. The images come to you like on a television. Then eventually they leave and it passes. 231 Q - Are you aware of your body though? LT - It's like you are sleeping. You're sleeping, but you are seeing what is happening. For example, how can I explain it: it's like you are under anaesthesia. On the screen, you are seeing how the doctors are operating on you. However you don't feel any pain. Q - Have you drunk it yourself, Mateo? MT - I haven't. I've only drunk nat\u00e9m . Q - So you see the doctor there? LT - Yes, like a person talking to you. A doctor comes before you. MT - A person comes to talk to you, a doctor, dressed in white. S/he language. S/he tells you that s/he's giving you power, that you are like this, that s/he's making you like this, that you are not going to die, and how it's going to be, that's how s/he speaks to you. Q - And this is the plant itself? MT - The plant itself. LT - The plant itself. T hat's how it happened to me. The power, the strength, is in that plant. Q - So given that you've had this experience, do you then give nat\u00e9m and maikiua to your own children? MT - No, no. We do not apply this culture anymore. LT - , it tastes very bitter, terrible. And one can have bad experiences, seeing the things that are going to happen to you. [...] MT - When I drank nat\u00e9m with my grandfather, I just wanted to see sex and tonnes of girls. But after drinking it, I regretted it. Sna kes everywhere! I am never going to drink it again, I I told my also saw lots of people watching over me. Wherever I turned, they were there. I couldn't stand it. So I ran ou t of my grandfather's house. I couldn't stand it. I started walking home, but I ended up sleeping outside. It was such a dark night that I slept among the coffee trees. In 232 the forest, there are so many mosquitos, and every mosquito was talking to me. That' s how it was. Q - Sounds tough. So that's why you're not giving it to the next generation? MT - Drinking it again was a frightening idea. I don't want to drink it again. LT - Look, it's not the same epoch now. Before, yes, it was very different. So again, we see this dynamic where the interviewees distance themselves from a practice (the maikiua healing) that they ostensibly see as praiseworthy. In no sense are they denying that the plant is curative, or even that one directly engages with the spirit of th e plant while being healed. Yet still they turn away from the practice, which they revealingly refer to as 'culture' and consider to be no longer theirs. In these cases, the mechanics of disbelief parallel Isabelle Stengers's description of modern of 'tolerance' which is 'instantly applied as soon as we hear, understand and accept that \"we\" are not like the others, those we define in terms of beliefs that we are proud, but possibly also pained, to no longer share' This modern adopted by Shuar miners illustrates on a micro -scale way in which modernity authorises knowledge practices and marginalises others through application of 'culture.' Within this subjectivity, waged miners lose the sens e that it is possible and desirable to combine the knowledge practices that constitute their cultural inheritance with everyday economic activity defined by and economic There moreover, an evident complementarity which together serve to dissociate contemporary, Shuar people from ancestral knowledge and practice. As for their rejection of nat\u00e9m , Lucio and Mateo Tsakimp explain their extent with reference to brew's acrid taste and to induce frightening 233 visions. Yet these characteristics are a constant, even in regions where it is consumed enthusiastically. One could argue that Mateo's complain ts about his experience are indicative of the separation of the brew from the socio -environmental context of Jivaroan peoples, in which a life constantly embroiled in minor discomforts of by fearlessness and resistance to hardship were granted a central place (see Taylor, 97). Having the willpower to confront te rrifying visions was the mark of man spoke of the capacity to remain steadfast when confronted with the very real of the waking world.59 In such cultures, it would be seen as weakness and vulnerability nat\u00e9m (Descola, 1996: 302 -3), as does, and even more disappointing to deny that education to one's once survival becomes primarily dependent on sho wing up for work, as it is for Mateo, Lucio and the other waged miners, such socialisation practices lose their original impetus. Yet there is a sense here that in striving to compose a post factum environmental determinist explanation for the rejection o f ayahuasca in a modern economic context, it is merely the accoutrements of the practice rather practice Alto illustrative point of contrast. While success in hunting and in agriculture is still a product of willpower in the face of constant physical challenges, as it has been for Shuar people for centuries, endemic feuding has disappeared, to the extent between vision -seeking practices and the capacity to face mortal 59 Among the indigenous Siona people in the Amazon of the Ecuadorian -Colombian border region, ayahuasca is also said to both require and breed strength in those who consume it (Langdon, 1992: 56). 234 threats ha s lost its absent the alternate subjectivity produced of modernity and material progress stimulated by participation waged Shuar Alto Nangaritza seemed much more resistant to disowning their heritage people. Consequently, they rites based relevance of the prac tice for the twenty -first century. As we saw in Chapter 4, vision -seeking had been adapted away from a discourse of warfare towards notions Alto the interdependency of discourses and if they are transform -seeking behaviour and their attendant ontologies. Turning to the use of suggestive of the economic factors on the changing relationship to the use of medicine in everyday life, and on inherited culture broadly speaki ng. Land, Plant Knowledge and the of Young Waged Labourers As was noted in Chapter 3, clinical medicine the foremost option Kayap, a Yanu a resident who works at the Mirador mine and was consequently subject to the severe hostility of some others in the community, in fact had an extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and claimed to have some two dozen types were also the exception in insisting on shaman ic treatment in the case of 'maldad', employing an interpretive framework familiar from Alto Nangaritza. As put it, 'When it's not a disease that, let's say, God himself put there, then these remedies have no effect. [...] You need to see \"maldad\" Despite the common disavowals of their relevance, the minority presence of these practices in the Quimi River Valley suggests that they were widespread in the province of Zamora - Chinchipe until What medicinal plants by waged miners was not simply the general level disinterest evident in their accounts, also considered thei r preference for clinical medicine to be so obvious that it required little explanation. As Mateo Tsakimp previously in Chapter 3), ' Of course , when it comes to sickness, I'm affiliated to social security and when my children are ill, I take th em for medical attention' [my emphasis]. Miners typically saw their lack of knowledge about medicinal plants as perhaps lamentable, but also as an unremarkable fact of life. An\u00edbal Tseremp, for example, who like many assumed that I was hoping for a detaile d description of the medicinal plants in the area, related: I could not explain much about this to you. My grandparents knew about it, but they're gone. So I'm not very well informed on this. Yes, there are medicinal plants, for a snakebite, for example. Now we do not apply this, because we have medicines and hospitals. That is why I don't have much knowledge about it. 236 Others were less outspoken but conveyed the same message. Facundo Kayuk, a Yanua resident and father of two in his late twenties, reported that 'we always go to the clinic, or the hospital. When it comes to natural medicine, we pretty much don't know anything about it.' He also said claimed t it medicines in the countryside (\"campo\"), we don't have much chance to do so.' This testimony was expressed in an area with very similar biophysical characteristics to the Nangaritza River Basin, with large areas of forest serv ing as a habitat for wild animals and where other interviewees reported making use of dozens of plants is accustomed to satisfying their needs through the cash economy. With the exception of two homes presided over by elderly women, which were permeated by the sour smell of fermenting batches of chicha which was so familiar in Nangaritza, all of the k itchens I saw in the Quimi River Valley were provisioned with store -bought goods. Indeed, it was a frequent complaint of the men I spoke with, when the conversation touched on 'traditional ways,' that their wives no longer prepared chicha (the men consider ed it beneath their dignity to do so themselves).60 Although clinical medical attention is provided free of charge in Ecuador and as such is not an economic product per se, the subjectivity created by a wage economy in which men leave the home to work for a wage and women remain at home in the private sphere -and very much idle in comparison with Shuar women in the subsistence economy 60 own attempt to h elp in preparing chicha during my first fortnight in Nangaritza seemed to have been the funniest thing anyone had seen in weeks. 237 needs. Indeed, it was remarked upon by t miners interviewed as a positive aspect of clinical medicine that it is 'free', while the same was never said about the region's native medicinal plants. The second indifference toward and absence of knowledge about medicinal plants is that for many of the miners in the valley, participation in the wage economy was itself a result and dislocation. The aforementioned Norma Tsakimp, who was able to live in Chu rubia with her Shuar husband thanks to her own ancestry, had previously lived in the far north of the Ecuadorian Amazon, where her husband was working in the oil industry in the province of Sucumb\u00edos. They subsequently moved back to a Shuar 'centro' on the urban periphery in Morona -Santiago, where her husband was raised, before he accepted a job at the Mirador mine and the two of them moved to Churubia. This personal history highlights the flaw in assuming a high degree of medicinal plant knowledge among 'indigenous peoples' and, on a more general level, their exteriority to modern discourses, subjectivities and economic forces. While it is true that Shuar culture is often generative of a high degree of knowledge about what we would call the 'natural' world -its elements and their with -this cultural inheritance is not necessarily the dominant cultural vector for the current generation of young Shuar parents. In the communities along the Quimi River, the lives of these particular Shuar people are shaped to a greater extent by their obligations with respect to their position relative to capital, as well as the scarcity of land, brought about number activity. For Norma, after having spent many 238 years in the wage economy in the city, it is not surprising th at the healing practices and native medicinal flora that are indigenous to Shuar traditionally occupied territory hold little personal importance. While her right to occupy indigenous land was passed to her hereditarily, the transmission of culture is far more complex. The fundamental importance of structural economic factors in shaping health Another waged miner who dismissed the relevance of traditional medicine, Facundo was at th e same time explicitly critical of the presence of the mine in the valley. His engagement with the mining economy -and the subsequent building of a life that revolved around soccer, television and purchased goods -was a response to the necessities of his con text, rather than a rejection of ancestral practices in and of In Facundo's words: - I work with ECSA [Ecuacorriente, the mine operator]. - It must be difficult, when your father is so against the mine. - How do I put this ... none of us like it . In one regard, mining is good, in another regard it is bad. It produces pollution. It pollutes the water that we drink and bathe in. One day it won't be like it is today. Sure, they say they are building tailings ponds, but what can they do with so much material that needs to be washed? The rivers are going to be contaminated. Then the animals will die and the plants will die. They can do rescue and reforestation, but not for all the living things there. The unspoken element to this critique -the 'in one r egard' -is that Facundo has no other options for providing for his family. Many in his position would find themselves seeking employment in -migration (e.g. Hartwig G., 1978: 89 -239 90). For Facundo, the absence of any prospect of controlling his own land has forced his decision to tie his fate to his economi c success, while all but disregarding the relevance of knowledge of his biophysical environment, including medicinal plants. A similar subjectivity seemed apparent another father, Asad Tsakimp. A resident of Churubia and 'artisan' miner, Asad healing practices by saying, 'But traditional medicine, what can I tell you about that? I don't really know. I just know that if I don't work I don't eat, so I have to do everything to get ahead for my family.' In short, what is evident in the Quimi River Valley is an of territory. While an unromantic portrait of a piece of indigenous Amazonia, there was nothing obviously distressing about this situation to Facundo and Asad themselves. Certainly Facundo was concerned about the possibility of water contamination from the Mirador mine; Asad, by contrast, rarely mentioned the mine during the months we remained friends. At the time of fieldwork, the two were living rent -free and debt -free young families, accessed owned their own well -stocked kitchens and plenty of toys: Facundo owned a DVD player and a television with a satellite connection, while Asad owned a keyboard and sound -system and played cumbia at local parties.61 Asad was also the only person I met in Ecuador who, upon hearing my response to the ubiquitous question of how much it would cost to fly to Austral ia, replied, 'That's not that much,' an indication of the degree of economic possibility afforded 61 This seems to be the appropriate point to mention that I was offered camera -during my River Valley. 240 by 'artisan' mining. This mirrors the small -scale indigenous mining economy of gold and diamonds in -Ferr\u00e1nde z comments: [M]any forced dispossession can be stopped in this way, what is the objection to those processes, given the apparent lack of alternatives? to the that associates existence of this reality obviously caution in might well lament humanity as a whole in the existence of gold and copper mining at the headwaters of the Amazon Basin. At the same time, one can hardly fault the survival tactics of these particular Shuar people. Their successful positioning in the context of a developing social -democratic state is admirable, and if the cost is their loss of immersion in the practical knowledge and universe of meaning that has sustained traditional Shuar health -seeking practices, as much ours as theirs. In considering the medicinal plant usage of Shuar miners in the valley, then, one could say that there is little imperative for the intercultural reform of the state toward greater cultural representativeness. This is not because of any kind of rejection of the legitimacy of medicinal plants, or even a preference for the real or imaged benefits of ph armaceutical medicine. The central issue was the pragmatic recognition of their own limited knowledge 62 For a similar case of a capital oriented strategy of autonomous indigenous development, see Ramos (2014: 44). 241 of such plants in combination with the way in which they related to the possibility of their use. On this count, the opinions of Jes\u00fas Tankamash of Churub ia were revealing: There are many different herbs, but we have forgotten them. One has to study a lot to be able to rescue this knowledge. One would have to make a nursery of each species, with each one named, but this would cost quite a bit of money. On top of that, if I want to sell these plants outside, I would need all these plants, with their respective names. That is the only way we could say we truly know our culture and fulfil our duty as Shuar. We can tell yo u the superficial knowledge, but we cannot explain it to you in depth. We have grown up here, but we are not such experts. We have seen things while growing up, but we don't know everything. This testimony striking is that will be analysed in the next chapter: a sort of self -essentialising internalisation of indigenous to such to not kn ow one's own culture: that is say, one's worldview and 'horizon of intelligibility'. Beyond that, however, it is interesting to that assumes being part of an individual's base of knowledge about his or her environment that facilitates health and survival. One cannot help but observe the subjectivity of a worker in the wage economy in expectation stands in stark contrast to the demands on those working in the subsistence economy to an economic rationale, with the necessary start -up investments and business plan for 242 sales to recoup those costs. His assumptions, in othe achieved by pooling the existing time, knowledge and environmental resources of the collective. One might conclud e, then, that between Shuar miners and mestizo Ecuadorian society, individuals' aims in health -seeking behaviour and the subsequent modality of their engagement with state healthcare is similar enough that there is little need to 'interculturalise' healthc are-whatever the mix of medicinal plants and pharmaceutical medicines in the materia medica -because of the significant degree to which there is a shared subjectivity relating to time, labour and knowledge between these groups. The Development and Rationa lisation of Shuar Communities? To what extent, then, does the entry of the mining industry into the Quimi River Valley represent a classically Weberian case of the disenchantment and a capitalist culture Judging by i nterviewees' greater tendency a 'consumerist' making a professional perhap s borne out of of specialisation developed experiences as Japhy Wilson, who de scribes development 'as a technology of power through extracted from their closed system -in which t heir survival depended on satisfying their experience alienation both in relation to the products of their own labour as well as the produ cts they rely upon for their material survival. They are thereby less inclined, the argument the specialised labour of others. The applicat ion of this interpretive frame to the Quimi River Valley is flawed in ways. critique of alienation in development portrays an exaggerat ed image of rupture when one 'rationalise' their economic behaviour in accordance with providing for their basic necessities via agriculture, hunting, construction, childcare, and so on. In historical perspective, one might even compare the close alignment between the fate of Shuar social units and the exponential growth rates of biological processes economies: surpluses into raising fowl, leading to larger and healthier family units, which then consume larger portions of the natural resource base through hunting and construction and ultimately find themselves in conflict with and discrete 'organic in non anthrop of the ethnographic present. By contrast, there is clear evidence that before the arrival of ECSA, Shuar people were already negotiating their involvement with setting up -raising cooperative s that the first Shuar federations enacted land rights claims, felling their own forest as a compromise with Ecuadorian state laws surrounding land reform and agreements communally -titled territory are demarcated as hunting -and-fishing reserves in exchange for cash payments, a case of what could b e called the rationalisation of biodiverse space. This is a local manifestation toward of sustainable development. Clearly then, Shuar people are not only cognisant of the rationalisation of productive activities, but have currently r ationalist modernity is more ideology than reality. It has been argued, in fact, that the magnificent intangibility of global commodity production and exchange and its impalpable governance stimulates popular reification previously predominant modes of production (Comaroff & Comaroff, 2001). In the Quimi Valley one is more likely to see subtle transformations of belief systems, Tsakimp's 245 with a form although a good deal uglier' (Harner, 1972: 150), as like slightly smaller versions of the gorillas he had seen in documentaries on television ; or Genesis Kayap's adaptation of treatments for 'susto' to ameliorating the shock felt by her young children when they saw a violent movie, where formerly the affliction was said to be caused by children's sudden visions of the dead (Descola, 1996: 233). One could also point to the evidence of absorption of discourses of the 'hyperreal Indian' (Ramos, 1994) and of material progress itself, as demonstrating the transformation of testified epistemological and rationalistic occupied by biomedical healthcare and state institutions, the responses from Shuar miners in the Quimi River Valley were almost as different again from those of their compatriots in Nangaritza. In their perceptions of and healing, visionary were incredibly aligned with the common sense judgements made by westerners in liberal mass society reg arding 'personalistic' illness, medicinal and the notions of ideal indigeneity reminiscent of global indigenous rights discourse, this group was able to separate themselves identificatio the relevance of these ancestral practices away, either in time or in space, and saw themselves instead in accordance with subjectivities aligned with the discourses of economic progress, monotheistic religion, or both. Even in the absence of produced by these discourses, however, the tendency to move away from the ancestral complex of health -seeking behaviours was still present. The coercive impact of economic conditions was evident in these cases, particularly upon the current generation of young parents. These interviewees' everyday economic would o f course consult with specialist doctors in case of the elder, economically independent Shuar people prided themselves on their knowledge and practice of traditionally Shuar health -seeking behaviour and derided the ignorance of the y ounger generation. In sum, the study of this small region's health -seeking behaviour illustrates of distinctively indigenous and alternate subjectivities been generated; or when the transmission of a specific practice demands the accumulation of knowledge through continual immersion in the biophysical environment to an extent not possible for those in the waged economy, these ancestral health -seeking behaviours tend to be abandoned. For this reason, the degree to which cultural difference 247 in the Quimi River Valley is significant enough to de mand meaningful intercultural reform in is dependent on peoples' capacity maintain the economic regime of mining, as well as from the discourses of Evangelism and material progress, which present alternativ es Shuar ancestors. On a more fundamental level, however, the fact that many Shuar the of ancestral health -seeking knowledge practice is an emanation of the paradox presented by cultural rights. tion of knowledge practices like shamanic healing in western Amazonia, which are the legacy of the diversity of human experience characteristic of the pre -globalised world. 248 Chapter 7: Medicine Discourse of I ndigenous Culture Thus far, this study has analysed the range of Shuar health -seeking practices and their attendant ontology a geographically isolated region of traditional Shuar territory (Chapter 4), before breaking off and evaluating the relative im pact and interaction with Shuar traditional practices of a pair of what have been termed vectors: Protestant Evangelism (in Chapter 5) Both of these vectors had a significant effect on health -seeking practice and o ntology, as was made visible in the statistical portrait developed in Chapter 3, which permitted comparison with knowledge and practice in regions and permeated by these div autochthonous and the in bound ontology and proposed that depended. Having established the nature of this clash, we w ere then free in Chapter 6 to explain the health -seeking practices of waged miners in interacting cultural including religion, chapter, it became apparent that health -seeking behaviours were not only affected by conditions on survival therefore on These economic conditions also 249 stimulated subjectivities of among Shuar people, thereby of these practices and belief in their efficacy. In this disjuncture between ancestral knowledge practices and modern subjectivity, the political identity of indigeneity was in fact instrumental in these indigenous people's abandonment of the former and the adoption of latter, in a manoeuvr e of identification with modernity that recalls the oft -made point that identity is always affirmed in a relational sense against the other (e.g. de la Cadena & Starn, 2009: 204). Ironically, for these indigenous people the other was located with groups th ey identified as expressing ideal indigeneity, celebrated and, the broader global discourse of indigenous rights constitutes one of the points of departure for the present chapter. Alongside it stands the statistical grounding presented in expressed discourse characteristic of the Pachakutik (PK) political party had no particular affinity for shamanism or visionary practices over and above those who did not express themselves in such a way. The PK -discourse group placed a greater importance on herbal medicine and a lesser importance on clinical medicine, but in both cases the difference was slight. Table 7 showed, moreover, that this discourse has permeated all of the Shuar communities in the present study, irrespective of the political affiliation of said communities with for emblematic practices to a supposed lac k of reach of this discourse. This 250 is especially so given that Pachakutik has controlled the Zamora -Chinchipe provincial government since 2009. The only logical way to account for both the potential of PK discourse to shape subjectivities and its lack of correlation with any specific trend in health -seeking behaviour is to propose the conclusion that its impact on Shuar behaviour and ontology is multivalent: that is to say, it is taken up in different ways for different results depending on the geographic and economic conditions with which it engages. The present chapter explores this hypothesis about the multivalent deployments of the discourse of indigeneity, detailing the ways in which Shuar people think through their own identity as indigenous in the ex change with an outside researcher and the consequences of the subjectivity they their engagement with traditional and clinical health -seeking behaviour and with the broader Ecuadorian society. The way in which Shuar people leverage, struggle with or to them in responding to questions of life and death, and therefore to their deepest commitments about the nature of reality and human life. The first section of this chapter will consider one of the ways in which indigenous rights discourse is mobilised by Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe: as an idiom invoking a history of resistance. For some interviewees, in terview questions of struggles to maintain autonomy and suspicion of state projects and mestizo people, in a manner of invoking indigeneity that speaks to the a strong historical consciousness, such as Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui (2008) and Tuhiwai Smith (1999). 251 These perspectives, most commonly expressed by residents of the geographically remote region of Alto Nangaritza, illustrated the im portance to some Shuar people of achieving autonomy with respect to mestizo society and state institutions in particular, the question which lies at the heart of campaigns for in Shuar as speaking with the voice of the people as a whole, the second section considers the effects of the discourse of indigeneity for Shuar people, and indigenous Ecuadorians more broadly, who have achieved a degree o f political or economic power and social integration in the aftermath of the 1999 -2006 period of political upheaval. This section addresses the apparent in mobilisations the discourse of indigeneity from a position of relativ e power (relative to their more marginalised indigenous compatriots), including cases of occlusion of class The way in which such interviewees through indigeneity tended on right s based on culture as opposed to rights based on history, as is more common in marginalised communities. They also expressed S In light of this discussion of the role of the political capital of indigenous culture in explaining its multivalent operations, critique of recent anthropological invocations of indigeneity. It does this by the argumentation of the previous chapter, drawing attention to the ways in which discourses province of Zamora -Chinchipe as well as Ecuador as a whole, where multiple indigenous ethnicities co -exist. In this respect, the chapter is with the minimal extant work on indigenous governmentality (Erazo, 2010, 2011), as well as with the numerous, more general political analyses of indigenous social movements and other actors in Ecuador and their role in national politics (Becker, 2010; G., 2010). Without disputing individuals' right to self -identify, I propose that given its multivalent nature, a to history, whether the evaluations being made concern land rights, the ecological sustainability of socio - economic systems, or the relative sophistication of knowledge systems. Indigeneity as an Idiom of Resistance The first sense in whic h the discourse of indigeneity appeared in interviews with Shuar people about their health -seeking practices and preferences was as a register for invoking the history of their local region and its people's resistance to colonisers, mestizo Ecuadorian soci ety and globalisation as a whole. This history would be framed around the assumption that 'pre -contact' Shuar society63 did not suffer from poverty and health afflictions to the same extent as Shuar people today; and as such, had no need for the clinical me dical coverage that is now provided by the state. At the same time, such 63 I place the term in inverted commas because the rapid colonisation of the majority of Shuar territory in Zamora -Chinchipe during the twentieth century was in fact the second -round of confrontation between Hispanic colonial society and Shuar people, the fi rst having resulted in the colonists being repelled at the end of the sixteenth century. Nor was their any notion of 'society' or 'the public' in a Habermasian sense to be during and the kidnapping of women (Descola, 1996: 192 -3), which have been superseded, thereby paint ing a generally negative portrait of their current situation by contrast with traditional life. Figure 10: Driving the in Nangaritza A paradigmatic example of this manner of historical consciousness of indigeneity and resistance to colonial society comes from Antonio Tukupi, an Evangelical man who lived about an hour's walk those are their orders. But we, as Shuar, have analysed this subject substantially, and our ancestors, our their own medicines, those t hat they found, natural ones. That is how they cured themselves. They were strong and brave. And by contrast, what are we? Our grandfathers, our they never 'cubanos' [a breed of chicken raised for commercial farming], which chemical. Now adays, what happens with us? In recent years, we our attitudes, we have become more civilised, rice, chicken, 'cubanos', that the colonisers sell. And this of our own chickens naturally -'pollos c riollos', the healthier ones, natural, without which only need maize, cassava and plantain, rather than feed. facets of colonial so ciety, including its food and medicine, is the best way to ensure Shuar people's health and strength. A similar example of an invocation of indigeneity as a paradise lost through the colonial encounter came from \u00d3scar Taish, who was 'Vice -S\u00edndico' of Shaim e and ran for an elected position on a Nangaritza municipality in the problems to Shuar territory: And now, well, we are in this world, open, and there are so many illnesses, and perhaps our grandfathers never knew of so many. And now we are all involved, like one single family. One person goes out to the city, another returns, and there are so many health problems. He then elabora tes on this point by comparing the newly emerging health problems faced by Shuar people with the coverage provided by the public health system. When asked the 255 standard question on whether his children had been vaccinated at the local clinic, \u00d3scar pondered on the issue as follows: - It's an obligation now. If you want to have an identification card, you need to be vaccinated. - What do you think about this? - Well, if you don't have do many processes. Whether it makes us well or not, we have to do it. It's the same with avoiding rabies. We have to have our dogs vaccinated. We never knew of this before. For the sake of prevention, we have these things done. After all, the bats come, and with a bite rabies can spread. But then again , how many times have I been bitten by bats, and I've never been sick. I think prevention is a good thing. But then again, before we never had so many things like this. Then we see sometimes that after being vaccinated the baby develops a fever, and they s ay, well, that is a symptom of the vaccine. So then they have to be bathed and they suffer. I think it is a preventative measure that they are doing. But then again, what vaccines ('qu\u00e9 vacunas')?! Our ancestors did this, and they well ('vivier on tranquilos'). Possibly they did have problems with illnesses, but they lived, and possibly they lived longer and were stronger. And nowadays, despite all of these programs, we keep having health programs their sense of deteriorating collective well -being. This point can be the common crit icism of pharmaceuticals provided by the clinic as 'calmantes' (sedatives), in that the overall engagement with colonial society is seen to have brought a 256 variety of problems for which the public health system is only able to provide partial or temporary s olutions. A very similar point is made by Ricardo Naanch when he outlines his own perspective on public health interventions from a standpoint of poverty and marginalisation. You know, we have to work so much, and from this work comes weariness, and from this comes illness. So much tiredness makes illnesses emerge from you. That is why we go for check -ups. But then, there are the medicines and the vitamins that we take from the pharmacy, but they are worth nothing to us. They don't cure us. Or if they do c ure us, it's just for a while. It alieves you for a while, but within two weeks the same sickness is back. In other words, where medical science presumes that individuals' basic material sustenance is accounted for, and from there visualises illness from the question of public health in the context of economic marginalisation and the baseline struggle for survival. It could also interpreted rawing on the Shuar notion, discussed in Chapter 4, that strength and sickness are at opposite ends of a continuum, where illness has been understood as the result of magical attacks from powerful and physical aggression from others (Harner, 1972: 135 -9). In this sense, it may be a logical extrapolation for \u00d3scar and Ricardo to interpret Shuar people's suffering not as a circumstance that just is, but rather as the resu lt of the deliberate action of others. Ricardo then elaborates on the point following a simple question about his preference between clinical or herbal medicine: 257 I would prefer nothing from the clinic. Like when a woman is having trouble with childbirth, I'd rather have and that's how she can strength. a mature chicken, rather than 'cubano' (a because ones are i njected with all sorts of stuff. The 'criollo' is grown up right here and it has much more strength and hardness in it. That's why it is more valuable to eat. It's important for a woman to eat plenty of chicken so she doesn't get too skinny and become weak and get sick. Whereas if I take her to the hospital, she can get all sorts of treatments, but she won't recover at all. But with what I can give her here, she will recover. Ricardo is expressing clearly a point that political systems worldwide rarely appe ar to have grasped: that is, that public health properly conceived would ensure the satisfaction of pharmaceuticals, specialist treatments, vitamin injections and so on. For Shuar people robbed of much of t heir land and concentrated in abandoned mission towns with a strained natural resource base, economic precariousness is a reality that free clinical healthcare can only partially abate. It is from this broader sense of suffering from the engagement with co lonisation that many Shuar people concluded that it would be preferable to make use of medicinal plants over clinical medicine -'that which is ours,' as so many interviewees said, or 'products from us Shuar, to be healthy,' in Ricardo' words -even as they al so often lamented their own lack of knowledge about medicinal plants. Their conclusion should not be seen as ethnocentric in character. On the contrary, the preference for traditional over clinical medicine among this group seemed to be one part of a broad er stance toward the Ecuadorian state based the relative efficacy of different medicines. 258 Beyond this general prefe rence for indigenous medicine, the discourse of indigeneity as consciousness could also be seen to generate radical opposition to the clinical medicine of the state health system. This attitude toward state clinics was a Again, Ricardo Naanch's words: Here in the clinic, they treat us all the time and they have lots of treatments, but we end up as sick as ever. These same treatmen ts cause us even more illness later. So many injections, so many vitamins, they just cause more illness. [...] The colonisers, they have a lot of envy of us as Shuar. The colonisers want to do away with the race of Shuar altogether, and produce purely their race ('la raza de colonos'), [like] the Colombians and others. They want to do away with all the native people ('Quieren terminarles a los nativos toditos'). So of course, when we go to the hospital, they help us, and then they give us bad injections and b ad remedies and bad treatments, and we don't realise because we don't know what kind of remedy it is. Sure, we have some idea -'this is a remedy for 'this don't know exactly what these products do, and they could be doing us harm ('da\u00f1o') too. So many people go to them to be cured, or they'll go to the hospital, but afterwards the same illness comes back. This isn't curing. It's the very hospitals and pharmacies that are giving us this sickness. So when I get sick I don't go to them for cures. Well, for some sickness, for fevers, I do go, but for the rest I won't. I have to stay in my house and look for some product to drink in order to 64 In Shaime, the doctor who served ther e had purchased an outboard motor to allow him easier access to the town by river, but it was stolen shortly after. Similarly, the school -teacher had had personal items stolen from her lodging in town. 259 make myself healthy. This same doctor that we go to here [at the clinic] to examine us, this same doctor can kill us. I've seen this. There are so many injections available in the city, and that's where the colonisers are as well. The colonisers envy us, the Shuar race. The colonisers recognise us as Shuar, and we don't know the medicines, so we let them inject us. And then if we die, who's going to say anything? I have seen many people killed by doctors. I have seen it. Again, through a discourse of opposition driven by historical consciousness of conflict with mestizo Ecuadorian society, preferences m edicines. The flaws in the way the public health system works for Shuar people are, moreover, interpreted as evidence that mestizo society has no well -being use of the discourse of indigenous identity and a lower willingness to make use of clinical medicine. These oral testimonies constitute local accounts which enter into dialogue with broader critiques of the role of public health and marginalisation. Such critiques include numerous works by Paul Farmer (1996, 2003, 2004), for whom the public health consequences of poverty, marginalisation and structural violence constitute the central theme of his research. In a simi lar vein, an ethnography of a Colombian plantation town to of pharmaceuticals and injectable substances, and return to the same dirty water and food shortage that created the preconditions of the health problem in the first (1987: 260 determined in large measure by their low socio - economic position' (2004: 65). She also points out, however, that development often paint inadequate the assets and resources of rural life' (2004: 64). Consequently, a key feature 'the social relationships, spiritual and intercultural relations invoking indigeneity as a discursive frame for on preferences between medical systems in fact implied a desire for recontextualisation of the debate about health and medicine. Segundo Santiak, another outspoken Shuar man that 'the we believe 65 They are of course significant to non -indigenous peo to maintain for indigenous peoples, are so vulnerable to the effects of dislocation provoked by the colonial encounter. 66 The way in which my mode of textual analysis of interviews -which are themselves public speech act s, at times undertaken with individuals with whom I had a minimal personal connection -privileges the more interviewees is one manner in which the present study, Jivaroan societies tend to place great importance on verba l and eloquence in men, while valuing modesty and demureness in women (Descola, 1996: 193, 195). That said, where circumstances made private conversation permissible I was able to record lengthy interviews with some women, of whom Alma Tunki, Martina and Elsa Tukupi, Laura and Teresa Yankuam and Ximena Charip were particularly influential in the development of this thesis. 261 in are our own products' and 'what comes from outside doesn't compare with what we have. Ours is higher, and what comes in is lower.' However, he goes on to argue: This is where we find ourselv es, but our shouldn't allow it, but even he himself doesn't realise what is being done to our poor people, our poor nationality, how we indigenous people are castigated. Traditional medicines will be all gone and they'll put only their medic ines. And us, where will we be? [...] The government says there are no Shuar and there are no indigenous people in Ecuador, only mestizos. For Segundo, the issue is not the minimal point that Shuar medicines are preferable, but the notion that the Ecuadorian state is attempting to wipe these medicines out so as to weaken the Shuar people and change the traditional way of life. Chapter 4 detailed the role played by medicinal plants in defence of medicinal plants used to inspire visionary experience s of transcendence. To speak of intercultural health in this sense recalls the political significance of vision -seeking practices for indigenous North Americans in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century as they faced the advancing colonial frontier (Niezen, 2000). Indeed, when Segundo expounds on virtues ) most prominent among them, his criteria are in no way limited to the physiological, but in fact merge these with personal and social values: - Did your father [the town's foremost shaman] give you medicines from a young age? - Yes, from the age of eight we started. With nat\u00e9m , with many products so that our blood may be strong, we may be valiant, have good energy ('una energ\u00eda buena'), alkali ne blood ('sangre amarga'), so that nothing can touch us. This is how we have been. 262 - Is this something you have done for your own children? - Of course. Once they are eight or nine years old. This [experience] goes on and on and stays with them. Once th ey are eight or ten years old, you apply this, and from this age, they continue on following their visions, thinking very differently, of what might have in time, what might happen when they're 24 years old, this is what we always see in these visions . - What changes do you note in children when they have been given nat\u00e9m ? - A great difference! They think differently. They think of the development of the community. For the Shuar people who understand their indigeneity in of a historical consciou sness resistance to colonisation, state interculturality is more pressing than elsewhere. Those Shuar who are most marginalised not only experience the greatest divergence between what they need to be healthy and how they interpre t health in comparison with what the state public health system provides; they are also the most ready to interpret these failings as deliberate policies of cultural and demographic aggression on part of mestizo society. As such, autonomous manag ement of the resources dedicated to public health is most important in these marginalised areas where consciousness of their indigenous identity is understood in terms of the history of colonialism and the experience of it as an ongoing reality. Indigenei ty indigeneity in the sense of referencing the common experience of (still) being subject to colonialism, 263 dispossession and marginalisation. be premature to minimise the relevance of that history to what it means to be indigenous in Ecuador, it is true that some indigenous groups are emerging from that history and beginning to prosper. For Shuar people, Pachakutik's control of prov incial governments in Zamora -Chinchipe and Morona - Santiago, the existence of a network of 'intercultural bilingual' schools, the isolated work of environmentalist NGOs and the economic importance of 'artisan' mining in the region (see Chapter 6) have all c ontributed to opening up spaces which belie any strict division between colonial society and indigenous Shuar territory. While 'artisan' mining provides the greatest degree of economic empowerment for Shuar people, it is probably the presence of Shuar repr esentatives in public -sector offices that has contributed most to legitimising the Amazonians' in urban spaces, which one nevertheless still sees contested in small ways, such as police station. banner painted on the wall to the left reads: 'In the soul, God, in the heart, Country, and in the blood, Police.'

In conversations Celestino a lamented that 'because education has been advancing, the youth do not place much importance on culture. [...] What is ours must be maintained. All the knowledge and customs must be maintained, and the language at least.' Yankuam of Wampishuk in Alto Nangaritza said, 'Sometimes we have to go to the health clinic in Shaime, or even to Zamora. But the important thing is that, like our forefathers, we ha ve our cultural medicines.' Matilde Yankuam of Kiim referred to herbal medicine as 'natural medicines, all the medicines that we cultivate as part our culture.' Justino Wampash from Shaime said, 'They believed in these things before. Now we are forgetting our own culture. We believe more in the pharmacy and that's where we go.' In each of these comments, there is an evident reification of Shuar culture as something that is potentially separate from themselves and more properly located in the pas t than the present, as though it were, in the perspective described by N\u00e9stor Garc\u00eda Canclini (1992: 196), a piece of folklore on the verge of disappearance. This is in contradistinction to the possibility of Shuar people seeing their culture as the web of meaning within which all their actions and aspirations are located, constantly recreated in their actions and choices they make in their everyday lives. That said, in all of these examples interviewees attributed significance to the partly because of reified of indigenous culture. seems be having a beneficial impact on Shuar people. However, as mentioned Chapter 6, the fact that this empowerment is achieved through the language of cultural rights -in other words, rights fou nded a history s ocial development and consciousness right to control engagement with the colonising society from a position of autonomy and self -determination. This distincti on can be explained by drawing attention to the confusion between culture as of conceptualisation' (Wagner, 1981: -and culture as defined within modern ontology 'as more or less exotic ways of accounting for the state o f the world that our own system of conceptualisation has established' (Descola, 2013: 30).67 While of unique, historically developed ideas with which to conceptualise and the world, the latter subo rdinates cultural' to a putatively true, For this reason, the revolutionary potential of interculturality requires an ontological definition of the framing of themselves and their difference from mainstream national society as 'cultural' 67 Note -state and not existing dominant normative matrix' (Walsh, 2002: 29). 267 in the second sense, Shuar and other indigenous people risk being taken into account in ways that are entirely alien to and excluding of their own 'culture' in the first sense. In part, this contradiction between v aluing one's own institutional political positions that are dependent on th eir identity as Shuar. Those who learn to represent Shuar people and culture within mestizo society are able to benefit at the same time as they distance themselves from immersion in the ancestral lifeways coextensive with that culture. One Shuar employee at the Office of the Bilingual Intercultural Education Department in Zamora68 was forcefully condemned by some seen as speaking on behalf of Shuar people whilst spending most of his time in the t own rather than in the jungle. Another Nangaritza man, a political official working for the Pachakutik provincial government, was held in contempt by some for leaving his wife and family to survive off the land without him while he lived and worked in the city. In both of these cases, furthermore, denunciations of these 'cultural professionals' rather than claim to reified and essentialised 'Shuar culture.' Inferring one could suggest that anthropologists would be seen as the most contemptible of those who speak about the lived culture concern about researchers as follows: 68 This office has since been merged into the Ministry of Education, but the Shuar teachers and administrators who managed intercultural and bil ingual components of the education program were retained. 268 The colonisers come here as well, and they take photos. They take photos, photos, and photos, then they take them and sell them, and they are earning a lot. Even one's word, the words that one says, these are being bought. These words that are spoken here and taken over there, and that's the way he spoke. They take these words, and then they take away...how it was spoken, I don't know, I can't quite understand it. They take away the words and these words that one speaks oneself are reproduced much more and t hen you make big earnings from it. You make earnings from this, saying, 'He spoke in this way.' You take it back with you there and you have your earnings. This suspicion toward to the alienation and development of knowledge embedded in a local context Charles Briggs calls 'rights decontextualize' lines of the research process I was continually encouraged to push on with the project by Shuar people who enthusiastically offered their own input. Rather, the issue that a is with the of knowledge to institutional contexts that are neither controlled by nor accessible to most Shuar people. This is an essential lesson for any elder land -owners in the Quimi River Valley were the most ready to adopt the discourse of indigeneity as campai gns. The same discursive themes were common to the two brothers who were the eldest men in Yanua (non -miners). The 's\u00edndico' of the midst of an inspired monologue: 269 They say that the Shuar is lazy and that is why he is poor, and that in contrast the 'campesino' works hard, produces timber and makes change. But the Shuar have known how to protect and conserve the forest, so that animals don't leave us when the water is damaged, the 'p\u00e1ramos'69 themselves. The 'campesino' doesn' t think of He of The reference to 'p\u00e1ramo' is particularly revealing here, because of its evocative status in Ecuadorian political discourse as the source of the country's water. This clearly has little historic relevance for Shuar people, but has evidently been adopted as a discursive theme indigenous are the claims about Shuar patrimony over and conservation of the forest, a theme that was invoked in similar fashion by the brother of the 's\u00edndico' following a simple question about the availability of medicinal plants in the immediate vicinity of his house: There are medicines around this area, many different medicines. This nature belong s to us, which is why it hurts us when it is destroyed. There are edible plants from the forest that nourish us. So it pains us to see that our government goes beyond the Constitution and smashes us. We claim our indigenous rights based on the Constitution , but this government is harming the Amazon. We don't want nature to be destroyed. This water is life, and not just for Ecuador, but for the world. Water has no price. Money makes the man, but water has no price. It's a gift from God. [...] We are beings of the Earth, so very small in comparison with God. God didn't send us here to destroy. We are here to protect nature. We care for the forest, for the animals. We are children of our ancestors, from here. 69 'P\u00e1ramo' refers to a type of high -mountain tropical ecosystem above the continuous forest line and below the permanent snow line. 270 It should not be considered suspect in and of itself these interviewees positioned themselves in such close with of indigenous peoples as stewards of 'nature', along the as Cavalcantini (2010), Maybury -Lewis (1992), (2010) and Pos ey and Overal (1990) and adopted by many indigenous organisations in of environmentalist rhetorical themes among Shu ar people generally, even among those who make use of Pachakutik discourse; and the fact that it was taken up most enthusiastically by these two Shuar men who had some of the greatest access to arable land and forested territory for hunting of any that I m et in the province. in the Quimi River Valley 271 To point out in this way that indigeneity can have implications for individuals' institutional and/or class interests is not to privilege the material over the discursive or to say that all individuals' language materiality that is not mediated by discours e, just as there is no discourse that is unrelated to materialities' (1995: 130). With regard to the particular interests highlighted in this section, the point is simply certain or simply irrelevant to many individuals -particularly young people -as they go about the process of socialisation and material adaptation to the circumstances they have inherited. That is to say, in the context of Zamora -Chinchipe it is unsurpr ising that young Shuar people do not identify with the association of indigeneity with a discourse of environmental stewardship when their elders have not granted them any land for which they might act as caretakers. As a general, concluding point, then, t his capacity of indigeneity to both facilitate individuals' negotiations of political and economic space within the existing order, as well as to act as an analytical tool invoking a historical consciousness of resistance The Distinct Rejections of by Shuar People When analysing the variety of discursive options through which individuals may identify and express themselves, there is always the an slate make choices unencumbered by the choices of others. And while most would accept the Foucaultian notions that power and knowledge 272 are fluid and are re -expressed at every node in th e networks through which they circulate, this by no means implies that every individual has sufficient power to redefine discursive Shuar and secondly, anthropologists as international authorisers of the social capital of indigeneity. As discussed in Chapter 3, the oppositional discourse relied by Pachakutik during its origins in the indigenous uprisings of the 1990s became much more difficult to sustain as the possibilities of power approached in the twenty -first century. The party has wrestled with this problem since the aborted coup in 2000, in which then CONAIE President Antonio Vargas joined with the military in an attempt to replace President Jamil Mahuad. More recently, the alliance between Pachakutik and Alianza Pa\u00eds during th e 2007 constituent assembly and the first two years of the Correa government ended up provoking further soul -searching, leading to reluctance to enter into alliances with government. The conflict over oil at Dayuma, which prompted the r esignation of Correa's Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaci\u00f3n, M\u00f3nica Chuji, drew attention to the more fundamental contradiction for Pachakutik as a party of government: that is, in striving to represent dozens maintain dilemma for the Ecuadorian left between socialist development, on the one hand, and -extractivism' and unequivocal support for it veto over national economic policy (Trujillo, 2010: 19). 273 This tension between socialist development and indigenous prior, informed consent manifested in the debate the of the Yasun\u00ed -ITT decision with -government leaders in Chi mborazo, Cotocachi, support government remained overwhelming in majority aborted coup of 30 September 2010 until the August 2015 protests, which were held indigenous and of Pachakutik. This worldview the Ecuadorian indigenous movement as a 70 This conflict is not only at the level of political difference. In August 2013, during my fieldwork in Nangaritza 'cant\u00f3n', a dispute over land in the Yacuambi Valley near Kiim between Kichwa -Saraguro and Shuar people left four people hospitalised with machete wounds (La Hora, 2013). 274 whole, Pachakutik itself and the party in Zamora -Chinchipe in particular. 72 percent of Ecuador's indigenous as Kichwa, as against 8 identifying as Shu ar (Mart\u00ednez Novo, 2014: 412). Traditionally, ey aspects of Kichwa culture include the pre -eminence of notions of time in which the past and the present co -exist (Greenway, 1998: 996), the complementarity between t he four directions and between a variety of dualisms (Maldonado Ruiz, 2010: 84, 86) and the social significance of communal land fea tures of the immediately apparent physical environment such as mountains, rivers and stars (Andrade, 1999). These relations are encapsulated by Christine Greenway as 'the geographical embodiment of spiritual and embodiment of social fo rces', thereby leading each person to social webs that require reciprocal exchanges of goods, labour and ritual activities' (1998: 993). This can be contrasted with the minimal importance of communal and spiritu al obligations between and the 'remarkable indifference' to the past and the passage of time of these 'amnes iac' peoples (Descola, 1996: 223, 225). government Quishpe, - Kichwa whose family runs the store in Zamora, selling hardware and construction materials obtained from m anufacturers in the Ecuadorian highlands and internationally. His government has instituted a project of development groups, which is oriented specifically toward financing the set -up of cacao or coffee farming. The caveat of this sti mulus, however, is that it is expected to be contracted to communities as a whole, and not to budding individual entrepreneurs. During my time in Yanua, pestered to make extravagant loans, or procure them from the mysterious international sources which, as a white man, I was presumed to have at my disposal. I would often reply to this that this,' he said. 'I am not going to work all day for another man's benefit.' The point was echoed by another man from Yanua: 'Everyone here has to work for himself. Here , we don't work united. Each one These men's assertions match the impressions of Descola and Taylor four decades ago when they remarked on a neighbouring Jivaroan group Indeed, an Oxfam -sponsored study found that communally run commercial development operations have typically not been viable in indigenous Amazonian communities, pointing out that 'community is a social form of organisation structured a s a political the land,' than an indigenous political organisation (Smith, 1996: 238 -9). These collectivist ideas about the significance of indigeneity for development and structures of social and political organisation ar e widely disseminated by Pachakutik's political leaders and collide with many of the assumptions to be found within the cultural inheritance of Shuar people. As such, it is unsurprising that Shuar people have adopted a variety of positionings with respect to indigeneity, seeking to interpret it within historical context taking different aspects of meaning depending on their institutional and 276 class positions, or at other times avoiding association with the identity or explici tly rejecting its to project'. These distinct deployments of the discourse of indigeneity by Shuar people in Zamora - Chinchipe contrast markedly with the often blithe the liberatory and empowering pot ential of indigeneity as a discourse anthropologists be expected to pay supreme cultural and reinforcing the cheap tropes of indigeneity anthropology of indigeneity. Gabriela Valdivia, for instance, criticises Juliet for as sovereignty, indigenous not group Amazonians -have a long history of acting intermediaries between western Amazonia and the Andes (Taylor, 1999: 238; Whitten, 1976). This criticis m is despite the fact that a central theme of Erazo's work is the use of strategic essentialism in indigenous governmentality and their engagements North ic tropes of ideal indigeneity, it could be argued, a -modern indigenous Amazonia and the capitalist world -system. In other works, the desire to put for th an activist anthropology that advocates the analysis of indigenous peoples' own of the discourse of indigeneity. Nicole Fabricant, for example, sets out to document 'the use of Andean historical mem ory as a up allowing a noticeable degree of creative license in her own writing. At various points, she 'Ayllu' is a Quechua and Aymara term referring to an extended family -centred community an anthropologist to cla rify the nature of and repeating much of the movement's rhetoric. A similar critique could be directed at the work of Jean Jackson and Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez (2009). These authors celebrate the Colombian Yanacona's playing up to the terms defined by international donors, which they refer t o as 'a community's ability to articulate doing, however, they overlook the manner in which the discourse of cultural rights circumscribes campaigns fo r collective rights on ethnic grounds in ways that, even in the small theatre relevant to the Yanacona example, appear to harm the interests of both non - indigenous poor farmers (2009: igenization campaign, Yanacona people were settled near the source of the river that provides drinking water to the town of San August\u00edn, meaning that the water flowing into the town became polluted. Although it recognises indigenous communal land title, t -multicultural Colombian state does not recognise free drinking water as a general collective right. Yanacona empowerment, in other words, clearly came at the cost of neighbouring mestizos. In their support for the Yanacona, Jackson and Ram\u00edre z demonstrate no reflection on their own role in international structures of power, 279 particularly the way their reproduction of the social capital of indigeneity perpetuates an understanding of legitimate collective political action to the detriment of broader collective struggles, in Colombia and elsewhere. In all of these cases, anthropologists have gone out of their way to celebrate indigenous agency in reworking very little recognition in the extant literature of either the multiple ways the discourses of indigeneity may be employed within the of indigeneity to indigenous people a sense of their own indigeneity72 (see Chapter 6); or the deeper question of the of delimitation of collective rights to the criteria of culture and ethnicity. In this final sense, a greater degree of reflexivity regarding anthropologists' role as authorisers of indigenous cultural forums and law seems advisable, as this would imply at tention to which anthropology doubtless maintains socialist in the highlands with missionaries, particularly in the Amazon (Rubenstein, 2001: risen to prominence within the context of a global trend 72 I was regularly told by Shuar people, even those who are entirely ethnically Shuar and live on indigenous communally -titled territory, that they are 'me dio they do not its idealised isolated forest peoples and by their own ancestors. 280 of international institutional support for valorising cultural difference and linking cultural rights to territory, a phenomenon eloquently documented by Charles Hale (2011: 186, Amazonian activists, political discourse characteristic of Pachakutik and global indigenous rights, they are not expressing an isolated affirmation of their own history, culture or a greater degree of pride for their own particular lifeways among indigenous peoples. To a small extent, this expectation is borne out by the data on medicinal plant usage among Shuar people in Zamora -Chinchipe. However, when these spoke about health -seeking practices and their attendant ontologies, not all of them invoked a sense of themselve s as indigenous people in formulating their responses. Among those who did, however, as we saw in Chapter 3, there was no preference toward shamanism and 'spiritual' practices, in spite of slightly greater preference for medicinal pla nts over clinical medicine. The conclusion thereby suggested -that indigenous rights discourse a multivalent, has no specific directionality or impact, but rather is taken up and deployed in a variety of disjointed ways, while being ig nored by many of the people most immersed in ancestral ways of life -has been confirmed in this chapter, at least within the small arena of the study, through an analysis of the discourse of indigeneity that brought colour and depth to the of 3. Indigeneity invoked, particularly as an idiom of historical consciousness and resistance to what was perceived as an ongoing colonial encounter with the Ecuadorian state. To speak about indigeno us identity in this sense stimulated productive of state institutions as well as encouraging outright rejection of all mestizo society and validation of elements of traditional society. Other Shuar people spoke of indigeneity as 'cultur indigenous resistance, allows for the easy categorisation of Shuar people within the worldview of non -indigenous people in terms of the minimalist celebration of cultural diversity implied multi iek, 1997). elder men who tracts land as validation their for Like who the value of 'culture', these men spoke in terms that have been formulated by and justify the marginal indigenous presence within the neoliberal multicultural system. For others, the lack of relevance of the discourse of indigeneity catalysed the impact of modernist subjectification73 associated with material progress and defined against idealised expressions of indigeneity. In this, I suggest, the applications of the notion of indigenous identity on the part of influential outside may Shuar people's alienation as Judith Butler (1997: 84, 90), though she prefers the translation 'subjection.' 282 While I have here sought to take the politically con tentious step of temporarily adopting a 'metadiscursive' subject position (see Briggs, 1996: 439) vis -\u00e0-vis the discourse of indigeneity, the study as a whole is very much implicated in the topic at hand in this chapter. To to of these are embodied in this very research project. If one accepts an ontological definition of culture74 and its implications for the intercultural, whic h is effectively a sine qua non for serious consideration of the present study, I argue that one should also take a historicist by the turn' (Kohn, 2015: 316), which has been subject now familiar criticisms regarding the 'flattening' of indigenous diversity by theory, the denial of coevalness in representation of indigenous people and the obviation of the contemporary polit ical emergencies they face (Ramos, 2012: 481, 483, 486). Yet there is no reason why the study of the range of human conceptualisations of the nature of reality needs to be pursued in an ahistorical, structuralist way; and no reason why its study should not make reference to the external religious, economic and political -discursive forces that I have termed cultural vectors and the a phenomenon to be automatically esteemed in t he liberal sense by which the capacity for 'tolerance' and 'inclusion' of external cultures is a in (e.g. 1991: 204). Culture should instead be esteemed by recognising a produced system of conceptual comple xity to which degrees of sophistication can only be added slowly and cumulatively. This in turn means 74 Contra a definition that accepts the modern, naturalist distinction between nature and culture and thus the differentiation between scientific facts about nature versus the culturally -specific beliefs of non - modern others. 283 acknowledging culture can only develop over long, continuous historical in ongoing intra and inter communication is permitted by conditions and dislocation inherent to colonialism, which remains in living memory for many Shuar people. In fact, some would argue that it never ceased. The knowledge practices that Shuar people turn to based on their health -seeking preferences are themselves dependent on cultures as systems of conceptual complexity. This includes both the medical science that had been in gestation during the period of civilisational continuity referred to as modern Europe and which developed rapidly with the material abundance of the post -war era in the twentieth century; These legacy the populous riverine trading peoples of the Upper Amazon (e.g. Porro, 1994), and perhaps especially those of the Ucayali, who were not subjugated until the late nineteenth century (see Santos -Granero, 2009: 22 -25), or of the urban peoples of the Amazon River proper, who were but Anna Roosevelt argues that there evidence of large -scale, very populous regional societies comparable to complex chiefdoms and small states known in other parts of the world' (1993: 260). Or, the words Claude L\u00e9vi -Strauss: There [in Amazonia], where we believed to have found the last evidence of archaic lifeways and modes of thought, we now recognise the complex engaged for millennia, and which have become disintegrated in the 284 lapse of two or three centuries, a tragic accident, itself historical, which the discovery of the New World was for them (1993: 9). This 'historicist' conception of knowledge practices and their attendant ontologies facilitates the comparison of systems of knowledge. It frees us from the obligation to somehow perceive and assess knowledge systems as more or less accurate representations of reality, instead allowing us to visualise as historically co particular socio -cultural experiences. By helping to explain when and how particular knowledge practices were developed, such a mode of analysis changes the question of comparison from one of better and worse, to one of recognising the partic and asking who such practices be good for today. An intercultural state would allow Shuar people the institutional space and autonomy to answer that question for themselves, well as the benefits for a radical interpretation of state interculturality that draws out the most fundamen tal epistemological and ontological implications of pluralising the cultural state. It argued that biomedical epistemology cannot rightly be seen as a neutral, universal arbiter of the efficacy and suitability of health -seeking practices across cultural contexts. the economic, and regulatory structures whose roots lie in the historical development of the industrial mass societies of the North -Atlantic world mean that its assumptions about the nature and producti on of medicines have come to appear arbitrary in the light of the cross -cultural encounter. Such a position can be viewed as an attack on biomedicine only by its most knowledge base and sophisticated in health crises. Indeed, biomedicine's a piece with its especially notable amongst these being the implicated in the socio -historical experience of Western Europe and North America , it cannot be p resumed as the standard for knowledge and practice in healing in Latin America. How then to assess a culture's healing practices without deferring to and ontological assumptions? The project of placing the focus on popular kn owledge in the cultural and epistemic 286 borderlands has its origins in this question. And indeed, where biomedicine arrives and is experienced in a context of colonial difference, as for example in Shuar territory in Alto Nangaritza in the far south -east of another, and to open up new conceptualisations of illness and new approaches to healing. This ranges from new materia medica -one thinks es pecially of the datura plasters shown in this research to be widely used breaks, sprains and other injuries -to the insistence among those Shuar committed to an ancestral ontology that health is not a normal state contradistinguished from illness. Inste ad, it is understood as a point on a continuum that ranges from weakness and marginalisation to -'the unfurling of the personality,' in the words of shaman C\u00e9sar S antiak -as well as harmonious socialisation with respect to one's family, neighbours and non -human environment, and steadfastness with respect to one's enemies. From a western perspective, the implications of this epistemology and ontology of health are fa r-reaching, suggesting new approaches to therapy, adolescent development and 'bio -psycho -social' approaches diagnosis and treatment (Re, & Sim\u00f5es, 2016: 238) and has with indigenous practitioners or to provide material support for the further development of their knowledge sy stems, which 287 is both their right as citizens of intercultural states and would also be but a small compensation for the historical extraction of indigenous lands. Despite demonstrating points, judged in the light initial intentions this project has had mixed success. Taking a approach to uncover a group of people's healthcare preferences in a way that goes beyond one health - seeking epistemology -and thereby finding out the co mposition of the set of health - seeking preferences of which the intercultural state this was the subtle conceptual implication of indigeneity as a space exterior to modernity and the western nation -state system, a methodological became its central problematic toward the end of Chapter 5, and in Chapter 6 in par ticular. Shuar Evangelicals, a significant minority within the Shuar population, have a distinct and very particular set of health -seeking preferences based on their own interpretation of assumptions transmitted to them by Evangelical missionaries their own ancestors. Yet the group cannot be viewed as a discrete culture with an independently developed body of health -seeking knowledge and practice. Rather, their preferences in healthcare for the most part resembled a materialist position, with a central place granted to the natural laws of the ordinary plane of reality, alongside passive supplication before the higher powers consciousness. Their it self. The group's the cultural specificity of presuming a commitment to what is known to be true. The Evangelical epistemology is moralised; in that sense, it could be argued t hat it is not an epistemology at all. Consequently, the Evangelical Shuar sub -culture brings question the notion that there is an empiricism native to the human condition, and which is therefore inherently present in traditions of in signify their value and relevance, as claimed by the ethnobotanists who led the ICBG Aguaruna and the ICBG Maya (see Chapter 1). While the non -Evangelical, non -working - class Shuar introduced in Chapter our commitment to prosperous, healthy and happy existence in bodies and lives in which we find ourselves, Evangelical Shuar did not demonstrate this concern with living out their lives effectively in the here and now of this earth. Instead, their primary conc ern is the avoidance of sin, with the pursuit of health and the vanquishing of illness as the subordinate goal. Although explicitly dependent on the former, as illness is said to be the result of sin, Evangelicals do not deny that the traditi Shuar also it presumes a relationship between truth and practice or knowledge and practice which is neither universal nor exclusive to the western secular subject. Although people were often drawn to Evangelism because in ancestral health -seeking knowledge practice, their continued adherence to the religion was not based on any suggestion of epistemic primacy, but on its proclaimed moral superiority. 289 The case of Shuar waged labourers was distinct, yet had a similar practices, in spite of the successful experience of many Shuar people in the region with healing via this modality. Again, as in Chapter 5, their rejection of these practices was not based on the claim that shamanic and practice or one would conclude when presuming a neutral epistemology on their part. Instead, their rejection of such practi ces was based on its perceived to their contemporary position vis striking reflection of antiquated tropes from the of the anthropology indigenous on cla ss considerations; that meant, in this context, access to and ownership of land. Those working -class Shuar who were not regularly immersed in a with clinical medical manner more similar to mestizo Ecuadorians than to fellow Shuar people with different geographic and class positionings. In sum, even indigenous Amazonians seemingly on the furthest of the world -system are clearl y cross -cut in a cultural sense transnational that on points from Chapters 5 and 6, one is drawn to conclude that the central place grant ed to epistemology as the means to articulating a is itself a modernist -specific preoccupation. With not just the popular knowledge 290 methodology of this thesis but in cultural analysis more broadly, we assume that individuals hav e an innate drive to learn about the world through their experiences and to maintain coherence in the way they understand it. Yet based on the testimonies of those Shuar people influenced by Protestant Evangelism and labour regimes the assumption is not borne out. They tend, instead, to see certain ontologies not as inaccurate or unbelievable but as morally as impossible reconcile with their identity subjectification or afterlife distorts the implicit understanding by secular west and ancestral Shuar culture -that the purpose of knowledge is to manifest tangible outcomes on the material plane of reality. For waged miners , we might desire' (1997: 102), fo r clearly they sense that an artific ial 'choice' has been made between material prosperity and ancestral knowledge and practice. None of this analysis would have been possible if not for the degree to which the lives of Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza (and occasionally elsewhere, as with those Shuar who controlled significant amounts of land in the Quimi Valley) ana lytical framework of exteriority presumed this region the preferenc es fundamental shaped by the effect of transnational cultural vectors. This is not to Alto Shuar represent a static, authentic manifestation of the culture of the Shuar nationality. As we saw in 291 Chapter 4, Alto Nangaritza Shuar people's comprehension of illness and modes of redressing it draw on the mestizo Ecuadorian conceptual vocabulary of envy, with its roots in Hispanic and Mediterranean folk aetiology, as well as drawing on the ima gery of modern weaponry, just as their ancestors employed the metaphoric repertoire of warfare as it existed in their own era. Having said that, the region's cultural trajectory can be characterised one adaptation, rather than of sudde n breakages in the transmission of knowledge -as appears to be occurring in the Quimi River Valley -or ancestral practices is evident Evangelical Shuar. How can we account for the fact that from a western perspecti ve, there appears to be obviously more value in the epistemological and ontological engagement with Shuar people in Alto Nangaritza than with Evangelical and working -class Shuar people? Part of the answer lies in the fact that these two latter groups are s o influenced by the same cultural vectors that have shaped the western world. As such, their health -seeking practices and general outlook on life are for the most part easily recognisable, even if these groups' relationship with the Shuar cultural inherita nce is complex. It would seem that Shuar waged miners can contribute little in the way of new approaches to knowledge production, except to the extent that their economic activity works to build up centres of political -economic gravity and their associated centres of knowledge production in and elsewhere. natural (divinely ordained) laws that was of a piece with that of Protestant northern Europe until just a few de cades ago. In this light, the value of cultural diversity in the sense is not necessarily 292 e case of autonomous organisation. I am therefore suggesting that it is not to indigenous ethnicity per se tha t interculturality owes its responsiveness. It is this distinct socio of many of Latin America's indigenous peoples during which layers and layers of conceptual complexity have been successively added to their healing and other knowle dge practices wherein lies the greatest potential for intercultural collaboration. The caveat here is revealed Evangelicals: the of cultures -an 'intercultural common -ground,' if yo u - that knowledge should inform and evaluate practice based on its implications in this life, and not in heaven, the wheel of karma, or elsewhere. The Culture of the State in Ecuador and Beyond An assumption made in this thesis that readers may have found optimistic relates of the state; words, the notion that the state is sufficiently empty of fixed qualities for the goal of culturally representative state institutions in a country as diverse as Ecuador to b e a possibility. Are states so wedded to projects of bureaucratic normalisation that they might the liberatory epistemic potential of interculturality? For advocates of the intercultural state, this question opens up a complementary line of investigation to the work of social and cultural anthropology that this thesis has for the most part pursued. It takes ethnography on a terrain of 293 significant difference to comprehend the fullest implications of state interculturality; but the study of the way the Ecuadorian state and others might respond to the the scope of this research. In lieu of venturing any grander propositions on the potential of states in general to become intercultural, I offer some observations on the prospects for state interculturality at the close of the Correa presidency. For institutions of the state to be representative of the cultures -and those cultures' systems of knowledge -in their vicinity, they would need to be headed not by specialis ts in 'cultural competency' but by recognised experts in specific fields of knowledge within the cultural group in question. This would mean, for example, that Shuar people would the state's policies in the fields of health, education, justice, and so on, for state institutions operating on Shuar territory. As discussed in Chapter 1, however, th e Alianza Pa\u00eds national government is centralist in character and has demonstrated a willingness to compete with Pachakutik and other political parties for control of the various institutional apparatus of the state. Clearly then, AP is unlikely to hand over control of branches of state ministries that it perceives as its own to PK -affiliated indigenous organisations. Yet as we have seen, in Shuar territory in Zamora -Chinchipe the PK -affiliated communities were precisely for epistemic pluralism would be most meaningful. The way around this impasse would seem to be for the relevant indigenous associations as of fashionable as it is to be pessimistic with regard to the state, some highly conceptually sophisticated comments forthcoming from Fernando Calder\u00f3n, Ecuador's former Director of Intercultural Health (a body under the Ministry of Public Health), suggest that such a policy may be politically feasible. supporting indigenous health -seeking practices, the Director pointed 57). with any profession, practitioners need to be certified not according to the norms of the state, but by their own associations. The Director went on to emphasise that In other words, there is an evident understanding that the principle of intercultural health is concept ually enriching, rather than simply an opportunity to facilitate the expansion of public health programs in their current form. The Director went on to stress that it is 'our ethical obligation declaration as the living cultural patrimony of the humanity of the future' (2010: 56, my emphasis). The notion of 'patrimony,' in particular, resonates with a his toricist view of culture as accumulated conceptual complexity, which I have argued is of epistemological and diversity lies scope and ambition task. Critiquing Liberal Multiculturalism Post -2016 This thesis is largely a critique of the conceptualisations of the state and culture i n liberal multiculturalism; as well as the way that its subtle Eurocentrism has facilitated its uptake as the political philosophy of choice for Latin American states that have done little to decolonise and become culturally representative. However, the emphasis on cultural peculiarities required principle of state interculturality is typically suspect not only by of 'indigenous Britons' by the likes of Nigel Farage (Morris, 2014) is, post -Brexit, no longer a laughing matter. Yet the reality is that those cultural groups that Marxists are wary of further empowering are not in need of a discourse of interculturality founded on the principle of the cultural representativeness of the state, as the intersecting privileges the incredibly well Mormon institution Brigham Young University in suggest that the enjoyment of culturally appropriate institutions such as education esse ntial to social reproduction is currently itself a class privilege. Meanwhile, on a global level, migrant, indigenous and African -descended populations are not typically in a position to be able to establish and benefit from such policed, which in the name of a universality that is generally a veiled Eurocentrism. It is in this intersectional sense that state interculturality is not just a pluralist position, but also a Marxist one. 296 Yet while the ethno -nationalist backlash need not make multicultural liberals of us all, it should alert us to the dangers of an intellectual s ectarianism the equivalent of the political sectarianism that led some progressively minded US citizens to focus their criticisms on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. For indigenous health lly get than a free healthcare service whose doctors have only basic cross - cultural competency training. Racism and a lazy neglect toward indigenous people are still common in Ecuador ian clinics and hospitals, and a fear borne of lack of access to medical tech nology still inflects Amazonian peoples ' engagement with the public health system (Aguirre, 2016: 19 -21). Sometimes the fear goes both ways: in April 2014, a Huaorani family reportedly brought a dead relative to a remote clinic in Pastaza province. The group responded with rage at the clinicians ' refusal to treat the dead body and went on to spear two Ecuadorian government development workers to death (El Universo, 2014). Two years after Fernando Calder\u00f3n was outlining the potential for intercultural health in Ecuador, Peru's Vice -Minister of Int erculturality announced that over the preceding year and a half, shamans had been murdered in the to the (Agencia Efe, 2011). Nonetheless, the obvious threats to even basic liberal advances should not make us content to set our sights on small goals. As is now very evident on the political level, perpetually movements such as that underway in Ecuador with hope and seek to add positive intercultural policy contributions to their endeavours is by no means a denial of the present 297 global challenges to even a minimalist, multicultural political program. One evening in Shaime, after the conversation had lingered a brief while lamenting the loss of ancestral practice among Shuar Evangelicals, a local man remarked, 'Between us w e can also arrive at a ourselves, this person [the Evangelical] to wane so much, when this person is a part of myself as well.' In the broadest historical sense, it ultimately be the catalyst for colonial societies to evolve beyond the fear and ignorance that both feeds base discrimination while also keeping our eyes closed to value make intellectual condemnations of racism and ignorance, which after all have no need of an intellectual fo undation in order to thrive . 298 References Acosta, Alberto (2013), 'Corre\u00edsmo: El nuevo modelo de dominaci\u00f3n burguesa', Sin Permiso , 1-14.
