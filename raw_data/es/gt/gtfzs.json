[P R Health Sci J 2016;35:100-107 ] Key words: Chinese medicine, Herbal medicine, History of medicine, Asian immigra - tion, Medical licensing, Juan de Dios Sian, Puerto Rico The phrase \"can't be saved even by the Chinese physician\" (\"no lo salva ni el m\u00e9dico chino\") is common parlance in Puerto Rico and Cuba to indicate a person with an incurable disease (1). Several websites relate the saying to the healers, particularly one called \"Cham Bom-Bi\u00e1,\" who arrived in Cuba in 1854 (2). As historians Marcos Cueto and Steven Palmer have recently remarked, Latin America has served for centuries as a dynamic frontier between Western and non-Western medicine (3). Indeed, the Archivo General de Puerto Rico includes a file on a Chinese healer. The anecdote of this \"m\u00e9dico chino\" serves to remind (rules and disobediences), access to care (and its limitations), the long history of herbal medicine in different cultures, and the attraction of unorthodox or novel therapies for patients who cannot access or do not benefit from standard treatments. Distant as the society of 1850 may seem to us, these are all strands in the web of present-day clinical practice. Massive emigration from China developed after the T reaty of Nanking with the British (1842). In the following two decades, large numbers of Chinese (also called at the time \"sons of the Celestial Empire\") went to gold-rush California, Peru, Panama (to build an interoceanic railroad line), and Central America and British possessions in the Caribbean. In 1847, about 600 Chinese were taken to Cuba as indentured laborers to work in sugarcane fields. The program was suspended in a year, but large-scale Chinese immigration resumed in 1853. More than 125,000 arrived up to 1873 (4). Their community became a visible component of society and has survived to this day, with influence even in religion (5). In Puerto Rico, three proposals to introduce Chinese field hands, from 1846 to 1857, did not come to fruition. Later, from 1865 to 1879, at least 335 Chinese convicts were sent here by courts in Cuba. They worked mostly on the construction of the Carretera Central, now Route 1, between Ponce and San Juan (from the south coast to the north coast) (6). These were not the first \"sons of the Celestial Empire\" to arrive in Puerto Rico. Juan De Dios Sian On 17 J une 1851, \"Don Juan de Dios Sian, native of China and resident in the town of \"professor of medicine 100 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez Chinese Healer in Puerto Rico, 1851-1853 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 June, 2016 treatments of other practitioners. \" He directed his request to the governor, because when he applied to the local representative of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n de Medicina y Cirug\u00eda (the institution that granted licensure to physicians from 1839 to 1899) with insults, calling he had documents to show his curative success in the principal towns of Cuba, where he had met no opposition from the authorities. He insisted that his services would not interfere with the services provided by treat for free \"the indigent and proletarian and for a modest fee [...] those who recovered their health. \" The petition was signed by Jos\u00e9 Ulises Quesada as friend of Sian (who did not know how to sign in Spanish) but there is also a signature in Chinese characters arranged vertically (Figure 1): Lin Cheng (8). A long note by Antonio Fort\u00fan, \"corregidor\" and military commander of the Ponce district, (9) also dated 17 June, states Sian arrived in with permit lieutenant-governor Cuba. The bearer was identified as a botanist. On 22 May 1851, the governor of Puerto Rico had granted a residency permit for his wife and a origin is not mentioned.) Fort\u00fan indicated that Sian, from the time of his arrival, and at the request of \"many sufferers who had wasted their time and spent some diseases, provided have because many have sought him. \" Fort\u00fan had Sian gave free \"remedios\" (medicines or treatments) the with treatment, personally known by Fort\u00fan, are mentioned by name: Eduardo, son of Faustina Guzm\u00e1n, had been ordered to house confinement by the previous \"corregidor\" , [leprosy]) spreading to others. \"Y esterday\" (16 June), Faustina brought the child before Fort\u00fan, who found no sign of illness. The son of \"Don\" F\u00e9lix P\u00e9rez, commander of night watchmen (\"serenos\") had been \"given up for lost\" due to a chest problem, but now the father had so much hope that he expressed \"only God's will could take the son from him\" . Mateo Ravaina had for some time lost use of the left arm and part of the left leg, and could now use the arm and climb stairs. \"Don\" Guillermo Wogt [sic - Voigt? a horse. closed by he provided this information [the situation] not to in agreement with on medicine\" , he asked the governor to resolve seemed (11). On 21 June the governor referred the petition to the Subdelegaci\u00f3n de Medicina. On June 23, the Junta or Board of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n met and indicated to the governor that Sian should for validation of his foreign training: to present the original diploma with a request undergo exams, \" An exception in the case of Sian would leave the Subdelegaci\u00f3n open to claims by other foreign physicians who had complied with the rules, and their respective consuls (12). On 25 June, the governor relayed the response to Fort\u00fan (13). I have found no further information about Sian's sojourn in Ponce. The only contemporary local newspaper, El Ponce\u00f1o, was first published more than a year after Sian's petition. In its two-year run, there is a \"Medical address against charlatanism\" by Andr\u00e9s Pr\u00edncipe, (14) Curiously, the newspaper shows a great interest in Chinese immigration. There are at least five editorials (all in 1853) promoting the importation of Chinese agricultural laborers (15). Sian 1852), identifying Juan de Dios de Jes\u00fas Sian, native of the city of Pequ\u00edn\" [Beijing]. He had arrived in San Juan, where there were witnesses of his many difficult cures obtained in other towns. He had been called by a multitude of persons with chronic diseases that had proved resistant to all efforts physicians. In Cuba, he had practiced his profession for over four years with the approval of all, \"even of by providing them with the medication they may need, and all those Y our Excellency may order in one of the hospitals of the capital [...]. \" This petition closes with Sian's full name in Spanish and a signature in Chinese (Figure 1). The first character is reminiscent of the rubrics used by Spanish notaries. It is followed by the three characters of the signature seen before, plus two new characters, the Chinese equivalent of \"Mr. \" The petition was again referred to the Subdelegaci\u00f3n (19 April 1852). Its response, longer and more forcefully worded, governor They to treat the poor gratis indicated his ignorance local laws, which would be violated by such behavior even if he were authorized to In addition, they mentioned the dangers to and the governor) that if officials \"forgot their duties\" in this regard, others could complain to the Real Junta Superior Gubernativa de Medicina y Cirug\u00eda (the central medical agency of the government in Madrid) which would ask the sovereign to punish addition, the denounced Sian's activities in San Juan to the governor. The man, \"known as el m\u00e9dico chino\" was treating \" This was a continuation of his behavior in Ponce and other towns, which he had confessed 10 Rigau.indd 101 5/19/2016 3:30:01 PMChinese Healer in Vol. 2 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez\"brazenly or inadvertently\" in his latest petition. The Board requested governor that the prescribed penalties fall on the law-breaker: for the first offense, a fine of 50 ducados [about $3,000-45,000 in present-day dollars (18)]; for the second, 100 ducados with banishment from the town of residence and from within 10 leagues of Madrid and royal residences; and for the third offense, 200 ducados and banishment to the military forts of Africa or America. The law allowed that these punishments be imposed without the need for trial, \"as the mentioned usually publicly July 1852), two Mayag\u00fcez residents, Jos\u00e9 Paradic and U. Basora, wrote to the governor. They claimed to be \"in to authorize Sian to practice without opposition from the local Board of Health and other physicians, and that pharmacists dispense the medications he might prescribe (20). Eight months on 30 March 1853, again of San Juan. His reasons for not complying with the law, and nevertheless practitioner bear foreign I would visit, I did not procure, on a certificate of my medical profession, anyway would not have possible, is inclined when teachers consider him skillful after experiments in the practice of the methods. There are no universities or colleges, and studies are not regulated; so much so, that for primary education there are no public schools, but teachers go to homes. That is why I cannot present any other title than my adequacy in the art of healing. And this I cannot show if I submit to an examination of basic knowledge [examen te\u00f3rico] due to the immense difference in the manner of learning, and because, not possessing Spanish, Latin, or the common modern languages, I would not be able to understand the questions or express the answers and decisions. Nevertheless, I can give practical proof, care of patients leprous, \"\u00e9ticos\" [with hectic fever, as in consumption], or with other grave conditions if still at the stage in which medicine can help. And the outcome will declare if my science is exact and my method produces the good result of providing health. T o this is added the good success I have had in this island and in Cuba [...] of which cases I could present a thousand documents but limit myself to the five enclosed, among them one from the municipality of Santa Mar\u00eda de Puerto Pr\u00edncipe [Camag\u00fcey], where at the request of a physician, and following the reports of the Inspection and Subdelegaci\u00f3n of the profession (due to prior knowledge of my practice) I was associated to the requesting physician to cure the leprosy or San L\u00e1zaro's malady that scourged that country at the time (21).This was signed only in ideograms, as the first petition, but with an additional fourth Chinese character (Figure 1). The last document on file, dated six weeks later (18 May 1853), is a receipt to the \"Secretar\u00eda de este Gobierno\" (the governor's office) for the documents \"enclosed with an application for permit to practice medicine and surgery in this island,\" signed by Sian (three Chinese characters only) (22). The minutes of the Board of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n, reviewed through the end of 1855, and the list of physicians whose diplomas were registered by the Subdelegaci\u00f3n from 1846 to 1897, offer no mention of Sian (23). Discussion \"El medico chino\" - The Chinese physician As indicated at the beginning of this article, the reference to \"el medico chino\" is common to Puerto Rico and Cuba. In the Figure 1. Signatures in Juan de Jes\u00fas Sian's petitions 17 June 1851 30 March 1853 5 April 1852 10 Rigau.indd 102 5/19/2016 3:30:01 PMChinese Healer in Puerto Rico, PRHSJ 35 No. 2 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez latter, it is frequently associated with one individual, Cham Bom Bi\u00e1, who arrived in Cuba in 1854. Academic publications also mention his name, but in addition, they reveal that the presence of, and fascination with a \"m\u00e9dico chino\" started with the first massive arrival of Asians in Havana (24). Sian's personal story provokes many questions; to start with, what was his name? There are three different Chinese signatures in his documents. All include three characters - Lin Hua Cheng. Each of the second and third signatures illustrated include larger ideogram that charms with the signature. The seal at the end of the third signature may mean good or great luck, or great fortune. If the three invariant characters are said in the Western manner, with family name last, he would be Hua Cheng Lin. Perhaps Hua suggested Juan as a first name. Appropriately, he was Juan de Dios ( John of God), which not only associated him with the Deity, but gave him the name of a saint who healed the poor (25). In subsequent petitions, Sian is Juan de Dios de Jes\u00fas, further associating his name with beneficence, healing, and Western religion. We do not know when Sian arrived in Ponce. Before that, he had spent four years in Cuba, which would place him with the first arrival of Chinese workers, but he does not fit that social category. He is always treated with the courtesy title of \"Don\" (even in Subdelegaci\u00f3n documents), to indicate distinction. We can tell he was brave he China to \"visit\" countries, as if he were a tourist. He left Cuba with a legal permit and was granted residency in Puerto Rico in May 1851. What profession, property or capital did he declare to request the permit? (26). Recent internet postings of Cuban newspapers historians and interviews with Sian's descendants. If the age of 68 years given in an 1879 census is correct, he was about 36 years old when the first Chinese laborers arrived in Havana. It is said he went as a physician, (surprisingly) with a capital of 20,000 Spanish pesos in gold. His skills were quickly acclaimed by the sick, but he was forced to close his practice when authorities asked for his diploma. He moved to Puerto Pr\u00edncipe (Camaguey) in 1848 (27). He converted to Catholicism very publicly, by interrupting a Good Friday procession, dressed in Oriental garb and kneeling before the image of Christ on the cross. Baptism with a Christian name followed on 25 April 1850. He developed a medical practice, and dressed in Occidental fashion (28). In the spring of 1851, a pro-independence conspiracy in Camaguey at that time, and Puerto Rico may have been the most convenient refuge, as another colony of Spain -with similar language, customs, and laws. Communications were relatively easy with Ponce, equally or more active as a port than San Juan (29). He eventually returned to Camaguey; the name of Juan de Dios Sian, in that city, is included among the myriad signatories of an 1865 petition for economic reforms, abolition of the slave trade and political representation in the Spanish Congress. (30) He had children in and out of wedlock, and some of his descendants still live in Camaguey (31). At his death (23 March 1885), an obituary praised his \"good success in the science of Galen\" (28). Oriental and Occidental herbal medicine If Sian was truly a Chinese \"professor of medicine and botany,\" what would have been the basis of his knowledge? His culture, over a millennial history, had deduced its own ideas of physiology and disease causation, and a diversity of therapies many dermatologic manifestations), and maladies which (Western) medical treatment not healed. As curative methods, he only mentioned herbs, for which his country, even now, is renowned. China has an to languages, in 1930 still constituted the basis for Chinese pharmacopeia (32). In 2015, one of the Nobel Prizes in Medicine was awarded to Mrs. Tu Y ouyou, for the chemical isolation of an effective medication against malaria from the plant recommended by herbalist tradition. Western practice has also shown a medicine. The Egyptians, in the Ebers papyrus of about 1550 BCE, Dioscorides in the first century CE, Nicol\u00e1s Monardes and Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez and their research on New World plants in the sixteenth century, and the discovery of the utility of cinchona (quinine), foxglove (digitalis), and bark of willow tree (salicylic acid) are a few examples of occidental interests (33). Therefore, herbal treatments were also part of routine practice in Puerto Rico, but as the result of different medical epistemology and heuristics. Even acupuncture, which Sian does not mention, was practiced in Europe and the United States in the early nineteenth century by a small number of physicians (but fell out of favor by 1859) (34). Sian was in Puerto Rico at the same time as Ren\u00e9 de Grosourdy, a better known botanist in our history. We might imagine them meeting, as embodiments of the Oriental and Occidental strains of herbal medicine. Grosourdy, a graduate of the University of Paris, validated his diploma in Puerto Rico on 21 January 1852 (35). In 1864 he published El m\u00e9dico bot\u00e1nico criollo (The America-born botanical physician), based on ten years' travel (36). The four-volume work served as a domestic reference for those far from standard health care (possibly not individual homes, but plantations with a large number of slaves) (37). Western medical theory still held that determined 10 in Puerto 1851-1853 PRHSJ Vol. 35 No. 2 June, 2016Rigau-P\u00e9rez the of local diseases. Concomitantly, local physicians claimed treatments such environmental conditions and botanical resources (38). In contrast to the effort by Grosourdy, how could Sian so quickly of healing properties of Caribbean plants? He may have learned about Western concepts in his native country, and about Caribbean diseases and plants during his years in Cuba. Occidental medical practices Research in the history of health and health care in Puerto Rico is limited by the absence of documentation. Many nineteenth-century newspapers have left no trace The archives for. The health-related material in the Archivo General de Puerto Rico comes from the municipalities or the governors' office; there is no significant body of documents from the Department of Health (established in 1911), its antecedent agencies, or its activities in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The archives of the Subdelegaci\u00f3n de Medicina, ten books consulted by Salvador Arana Soto in the offices of the T ribunal Examinador de M\u00e9dicos in the 1960s (40) are still in its daughter agency, the Junta de Licenciamiento y Disciplina M\u00e9dica. In preindustrial societies, access to licensed physicians was rare (41). In Puerto Rico their number was low (about 170 for a million people at the end of the century) (42) and a significant proportion were foreigners. Of the 24 physicians awarded licenses in Puerto Rico from 1848 to 1853, eight (33%) graduated in universities outside of Spain and had non-Hispanic Licensed physicians concentrated in urban areas (and in San Juan, Ponce and Mayag\u00fcez, cities Sian visited), and consultation was de solemnidad\"), but Ponce did not have such a position in 1852. Instead, all licensed physicians had a \"public (distant journeys, often unnecessary, on bad roads any time or the patients' (43). The Subdelegaci\u00f3n's statement (19 1852) that provision of free care was not allowed by regulations is surprising. This may have been legal only for titulares\" or the certified indigent. Some physicians served plantations pre-arranged fee (44). It may be that, paradoxically, slaves were more likely to be attended by physicians than poor free laborers, who had no to safeguard them as valuable property. That population, dispersed in rural areas and highly illiterate, could resort to personal knowledge, the and acquaintances, \"curanderos\" (traditional healers), the Deity and the saints, and in extreme cases, witchcraft, spirits or any promising novelty (45). (46). Practitioners trained as apprentices in the high fees), benevolent scholars who studied charge), (47). the Subdelegaci\u00f3n have given Sian a license to practice? From their point of view, as enforcers of the laws to regulate the practice of medicine, it was impossible. Besides, the more information he provided, the further he discredited his case. He first claimed he presented a document in Ponce, but later stated he had no diploma. Instead, he proposed that the Board trust his (alleged) track record, and allow, as in China, \"experiments in the practice of the methods\" to show his skill. We only know of the four cures noted by Fort\u00fan, but there is no follow-up to detect relapses or a report of how many treatments were unproductive. If Sian did not know any Western languages, how did he manage in his travels? How could he understand patients, because he took care to be government control, as self-evidently beneficial to us, in part because of its 500-year use in Puerto Rico. Although the Chinese avoidance of credentialing seemed uncivilized to Spanish practitioners, it was not an exclusive practice of the Far East. Social support for medical licensure disappeared in some Western countries in the mid-1800s. Colombia, where Spanish law had applied in colonial times, in 1850 eliminated the requirement of a university diploma for the practice of all professions except medicine (48). In the United States, almost every state had some legal control over licensure before the 1830s, and none by the 1860s (49). These changes were motivated, in part, by the diffusion of the ideas of the first economic and political liberalism, that opposed governmental regulation, but also by the low efficacy of institutionalized medicine. Western practice in 1850 was reliably successful mostly in a small of the and tremor, The pills were made \"entirely from medicinal herbs, without mercury or available in pharmacies in different towns, evidently without need of physician prescription, cost 4, 8 and 12 \"reales\" for a small container (\"el frasquito\"). At the time, a rural laborer earned 2-3 reales for a 12-hour day of work (52). Spanish and German leeches cost 1.5-3 reales per specimen, and an ounce of quinine sulfate cost 4 pesos (32 reales) (53). For the United States, it is estimated that a \"patient variety of serious ailments\" only beginning around 1935-1945 (54). This, of course, does not take into account the situations in which the healer's empathy produces a cure by a change in the patient's attitude or behavior. In such a context, \"el m\u00e9dico chino,\" even with rudimentary knowledge, if armed with a persuasive personality, may have cured many who had never seen a physician, and some whose medical treatment was unsuccessful or harmful. Sian's petitions the story of early impact of Chinese immigration in the Spanish Antilles, and show that Puerto Rico, shortly after Cuba, experienced at least one widely known \"m\u00e9dico chino. \" showed patients, for using methods they did not know, and most likely also because he could be a competitor for paying acceptance of herbal treatments at the time. As Cueto and Palmer have indicated for Latin America, popular medicine in Puerto Rico in the mid-nineteenth century incorporated elements of all medicines and religions, and all segments of society made use of such healing practices (55). This is now a reality beyond Latin America. In the population-based 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey, 24 % of respondents aged 18 years or more, without cancer, used herbal therapies and \"supplements\" (i. e., chondroitin, fish oil, glucosamine) in the previous year, compared to 32 % of those with cancer (56). In Puerto Rico, a recent unpublished study in one hospital found 143 of 233 (61 %) cancer patients aged 21 years or more onto the contemporary procedures regarding medical licensing and health care. We see a bureaucracy that is surprisingly rapid in some aspects: on June 17 Sian submits his petition in Ponce; the same day it is forwarded by the \"corregidor\" and in 8 days the response, which involved two agencies, is sent back to Ponce. Sian gets a rapid answer to his petition (even if it is not what he requests) but the Subdelegaci\u00f3n's opposed to the flexible attitude of military officers who hold office at central and local levels. In the context of a large underserved that with the regulations\" , but they let him act. Prescribed medications, Sian provided free to poor, while the Subdelegaci\u00f3n the Asiatic to sell them at immoderate apothecaries in Ponce sold a single leech for up to 3 reales, the salary for 12 hours of work by a well-paid laborer? T ranslated to the current minimal Ponce, charlatans. \u00bfShould the Subdelegaci\u00f3n have granted Sian a license to practice medicine? As the organism charged with enforcing the laws that regulated the practice of medicine, it was impossible. Nevertheless, in the face of so few physicians and so many needing help, was it the best response to the ethical dilemma between forbidding cures not Elements of Sian's the medications, medical licensing, impotence of the licensing agency to control an unorthodox but popular healer, and the toleration of authorities, exemplify situations that accompany medical practice at all times. The study of the historical circumstances of the medical profession is, in addition, a rich source for the ethical training of professionals in facing current-day problems. Resumen En Puerto Rico y Cuba, la frase popular \"no lo salva ni el m\u00e9dico chino\" indica un caso incurable. Los documentos en el Archivo General de Puerto Rico incluyen tres solicitudes de licencia para practicar la medicina del inmigrante chino Juan de Dios Sian (Lin Hua Cheng). A pesar de serle negada la autorizaci\u00f3n, utiliz\u00f3 hierbas medicinales para tratar personas con enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas en Ponce, San Juan y Mayag\u00fcez de 1851 a 1853. Antes de llegar a Ponce vivi\u00f3 cuatro a\u00f1os en Cuba, donde aparece otra vez para 1865. Las solicitudes de Sian demuestran que, en Puerto Rico, como en Cuba, ejerci\u00f3 un \"m\u00e9dico chino\" ampliamente conocido.
