There are many theories of aging, and one of great importance in recent years is the mitochondrial theory of aging, in which mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs at advanced age could be responsible for the aged phenotype. In this context, there is diverse information about mitochondrial dysfunction in aging, in different models and different organs. Specifically, in the brain, different studies have shown mitochondrial dysfunction mainly in the cortex; however, until now, no study has shown all the defects in hippocampal mitochondria in aged female C57BL/6J mice. We performed a complete analysis of mitochondrial function in 3-month-old and 20-month-old (mo) female C57BL/6J mice, specifically in the hippocampus of these animals. We observed an impairment in bioenergetic function, indicated by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, O2 consumption, and mitochondrial ATP production. Additionally, there was an increase in ROS production in the aged hippocampus, leading to the activation of antioxidant signaling, specifically the Nrf2 pathway. It was also observed that aged animals had deregulation of calcium homeostasis, with more sensitive mitochondria to calcium overload and deregulation of proteins related to mitochondrial dynamics and quality control processes. Finally, we observed a decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis with a decrease in mitochondrial mass and deregulation of mitophagy. These results show that during the aging process, damaged mitochondria accumulate, which could contribute to or be responsible for the aging phenotype and age-related disabilities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-13", "cleaned_text": "region compromised [ [2](#B2-ijms-24-05476)]. Specifically, in the hippocampus, the brain region controlling the and recognition Their main functions include ATP production, Ca2+ homeostasis, and redox balance [ [5](#B5-ijms-24-05476)], all essential as III [ [6](#B6-ijms-24-05476)], and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of complex I, and necessary for the correct functioning of regulated by mitochondria in the same murine model has not been investigated in depth. Indeed, the hippocampus [ [28](#B28-ijms-24-05476)], but they were carried out on different models, such as rat and mouse, or using different strains of mice, sex, and ages [ [29](#B29-ijms-24-05476), [30](#B30-ijms-24-05476), [31](#B31-ijms-24-05476)]. Therefore, the lack of a complete the alterations that occur in mitochondria during aging in the same animal model, strain, sex, and age has hindered the understanding of the the study of aging [33](#B33-ijms-24-05476)]. This strain has an average lifespan of approximately 24 months. From 18 to 24 months old, they are considered aged, as this age range is equivalent to 56 to 69 years in human years [ [34](#B34-ijms-24-05476)]. In this research, we analyzed dependent on the function of the ETC complexes, which are embedded in the cristae of IMM, we evaluated the bioenergetic of a mice ( [Figure 1](#ijms-24-05476-f001)A), which is in line with the decrease in the expression of complexes I and IV, as we have previously shown [ In observed a decrease in the reduction in oxygen due to electron leakage from the ETC, and then they are converted H2O2 by the mitochondrial superoxide dismutases (SODs) [ the hippocampal-enriched-mitochondrial fraction through the fluorescent dye mitochondrial ROS induces oxidative damage in the cells, and in order to do so, we measured the levels of nitration of tyrosine residues antioxidant oxidative stress is 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that, translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of a variety of genes associated with antioxidant response [ [37](#B37-ijms-24-05476)]. We evaluated the levels of is involved in 20 mo mice. This is accompanied by an increase results indicate that, aging, variety of processes within the cells, such cell death, cellular 3 mo and 20 mo mice. We observed that there was an increase in the dentate gyrus of aged mitochondria when the in the hippocampus of the aged mice and there was an increase in the activity of this mitochondrial together with the increase in been described. Thus, we evaluated the protein expression of fission and fusion proteins in the hippocampus of the 3 mo and 20 mo mice processes due to a decrease in Drp1 but not in the mechanism of recruitment to the mitochondria. Regarding fusion proteins, we no in ratio (AR) in the adult and aged hippocampus, and we found that the mitochondria of the 20 mo mice had a significant increase in the AR due to an increase in their length when compared with a decrease in fission and fusion, which may result in more damaged mitochondria since they would NRF1 and complexes encoded in the nucleus [ The of decrease in the in the three hippocampal regions and where aged [59](#B59-ijms-24-05476)]. There as a measurement of mitophagy in normal aging, and we did not observe significant changes between the 3 mo and 20 mo mice. Then, we evaluated the mitochondrial and with activity 1 12 both rats and mice [ [65](#B65-ijms-24-05476)]. Similarly, the analysis of production depends on the correct assembly and function of ETC complexes and these are located in the IMM, mitochondrial could also electron density major amount complexes and, could in the formation of supercomplexes the ETC complexes, which coincides with the in production status. [72](#B72-ijms-24-05476)]; thus, shown during aging, there is an expression of an enzyme [64](#B64-ijms-24-05476), [74](#B74-ijms-24-05476)], which led to the free-radical theory of aging [ [75](#B75-ijms-24-05476)]. In our study, we observed increased ROS production by that antioxidant response in aged males is approximately half that in females [ [29](#B29-ijms-24-05476), [82](#B82-ijms-24-05476)]. These emphasize enzymes in comparison to the males [ [82](#B82-ijms-24-05476)]. In the presence of rotenone (a strong inhibitor of I hippocampus of male antioxidant target genes [ [91](#B91-ijms-24-05476)]. Similarly, our in the fraction activity. to validate in the hippocampal to an increase mPTP activity, which is denoted by an master of protein levels. The which detrimental to cells. Therefore, the decrease in the mRNA could are altered in aged brains but, until now, only a few studies have on mitochondrial dynamics [ [26](#B26-ijms-24-05476), [99](#B99-ijms-24-05476)]. For Drp1 has been shown to decrease in the aged brain in a global proteomic study, but Mfn1 was elevated in the same aged group, consistent with a pro-fusion state [ [100](#B100-ijms-24-05476)]. Another study of a mouse model of accelerated senescence SAMP8 shows that Drp1, Mfn2, also fission [101](#B101-ijms-24-05476)]. These did not observe changes in MFF, we suggest that the reduction in fission processes could be due the expression and regulation Drp1 more than impairment in the machine recruitment; however, analysis of the other proteins is still needed. The reduction in Opa1 is in line with the decrease that we observed in the electrodensity of aged Opa1 plays cristae therefore, in this protein to reduction in the definition ratio (AR), suggesting that these mitochondria are longer and more elliptical. Since our data show a decrease in Drp1 and Opa1 levels but not in Mfn1 and Mfn2, these more elongated mitochondria could be due a decrease in the process [ [105](#B105-ijms-24-05476)]. Moreover, as we demonstrated previously again show now, these elongated mitochondria are damaged, with an increase in swelling [ [35](#B35-ijms-24-05476)], suggesting that the increase in the AR may be more related to an increase in damage alongside a contrast, increased compared to adult mice, but there was no change levels in line increase cytoplasmic regulated. A mouse hippocampus that PGC1 On the other study on aged fibroblasts shows that decreased protein covalently binds to mitochondrial proteins. Here, we show that not only is mitochondrial mass reduced in the hippocampus of fraction. These observations were found in all the regions of the hippocampus, as we and others have suggested [ [35](#B35-ijms-24-05476), [112](#B112-ijms-24-05476)], supporting aged animals. Interestingly, and in concordance aging male rats, and this decrease was counteracted with high E, which show that mitophagy is reduced up to 70% in the hippocampus of aged mice [ [116](#B116-ijms-24-05476)]. within the lysosome is decreased, which, alongside our data, could indicate that there is an induction of mitophagy in aging, leading to the accumulation of PINK1 and Parkin in the mitochondria. However, mitophagy is not due an flux. contributing the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, and (25 mM Hepes, 125 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 30 \u00b5M, a homogenizer and calibers.
