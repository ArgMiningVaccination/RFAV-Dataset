The continuity of MDR strain genotyping in time offered a widespread picture of the situation that allows better management of this public health problem. It also shows the advantage of maintaining one over time, which and rifampicin (RIF), has almost doubled globally over the past 5 years [1](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR1). The high number of cases in some countries remains constant threat [2](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR2). Spain has a partially In January 1998 a monitor the spread of MDR-TB based on genotyping was set up an early warning system [3](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR3). Previous monitoring studies of this network conducted at 3 and 11 years allowed us to attain an understanding of the MDR-TB genotyping endorsed the use of resistance-associated mutations to INH and RIF which increased the discriminatory power [5](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR5). The knowledge on Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome has led to the search for the best genotyping method in molecular and was the selected method for the surveillance in Europe by EuroTb data in The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Until 2015, the Spanish network, contributed with 406 isolates being the second country in number included [8](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR8). In 2019, ECDC proposed the MDR-TB situation in Spain until 2017, since the creation of the Spanish network on drug-resistant TB in 1998. It shows the Community, prior to the incorporation of WGS. It presents the MDR-TB patterns in Spain and their distribution around the country. In addition, the social, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients were related with clustering to get a better understanding of the characteristics of MDR/XDR TB routes of the disease in Spain. Methods The Spanish Working Group network on MDR-TB integrates laboratories distributed across isolates of M. well information to our Mycobacterial Genetics Group laboratory (located at the University of Zaragoza) to detect, analyse and notify the outbreaks as foreseen in the plan for the prevention and control of tuberculosis in Spain. The samples were encrypted by a technician with a code named \"NSTRAIN\", which included three capital letters ESC, and nine digits, the first four digits corresponded to the year of isolation of the strain, and the last five were given in the order in which the samples were received. The collected information included the hospital and the region where the isolations came from, susceptibility test results, and age, gender, country of birth, previous treatment and other major risk factors for TB of the cases [3](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR3). The report of the genotyping results was sent back to the laboratories of origin and when similar genotypes involved different regions a report was sent to the National Centre for Epidemiology (CNE, abbreviation in Spanish). Since 2009, the genotypes obtained 2017, were genotyped. Only the first isolate per case was included. Those samples with not enough DNA to obtain a genotype were comparison among the genotypes along the different periods of the (Fig. [1](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig1)). The Spoligo-International-Type (SIT) labels were assigned [9](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR9). The target genes for RIF and INH were analysed. The genotypes of the MDR cases based on 24-MIRU-VNTR were incorporated in TESSy [7](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR7). Cluster analysis In our study, isolates were considered in cluster if they related The index case was considered the first case detected in each cluster. The named receiving a number preceded by or \"bv\" for M. bovis. Exceptions were made with clusters involving Beijing strains, which named Beijing followed by pattern and a consecutive number, and with those clusters considered evolved which maintained the original name followed by a letter. Statistical analysis We compared the distribution of the characteristics of clustered and less than five. We evaluated the differences in the distribution of the quantitative variables studied using the Student's-t test in the case of normal variables, or the Mann-Whitney U test in the case of non-parametric variables. We used Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association of variables with clustering. A p value of less than statistically declarations The planning conducted of the study was approved by the Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica de la Investigaci\u00f3n de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Arag\u00f3n (CEICA), Spain, CI.PI18/068. The protocol followed is in line with the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013. Once received the bacterial isolate, it was coded (NSTRAIN). The information about the cases were sent by fax and was anonymised keeping only the code given to track the analysis of the clinical characteristics, to follow the Helsinki ethical principles for medical research involving human data. Comit\u00e9 de \u00c9tica de la Investigaci\u00f3n de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Arag\u00f3n (CEICA) waived need for informed consent tuberculosis complex isolates received were genotyped and further analysed. A total inactivated isolates from 834 patients were received during the study period from 1998 through 2017. In total, 137 samples were excluded due to laboratory cross-contaminations (n = 3), insufficient sample amount to obtain a genotype (n = 42), as well as multiple isolates from the same patient (n = 92). Finally, the studied population included 789 corresponding number of patients. The number of isolates included per year Fig. [2](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig2). Among the 789 isolates, 48.4% grouped 77 clusters cases per cluster) (Fig. [3](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig3)). According to their spoligotipe, 51 of the clusters belonged to Lineage (L) 4, 19 of which were L4.1.2 (Haarlem family), 15 were L4.3 (LAM family), two were L4.4.1 (S family), one was L4.1.1 (X family) and 14 clusters were assigned as L4 as T ill-defined family Nine of the clusters belonged to lineage 2 and one cluster belonged to Animal linage. Thirteen genotypes had no Spoligotype assigned and one was unknown. There was great variability in how the size and time-frame of clusters increased (Fig. [4](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig4)). The persistence of clusters ranged between 1 and 18 years. For instance, cluster tb34, onset abruptly with five cases in the same year followed by a new case three years later; but others, as tb40 cluster with 11 cases, occurred over 13 years with a maximum of two cases per year (Fig. [4](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig4)). Among the 420 different clusters: bv1 included meanwhile the 9 were distributed among clusters: data of the patients were revised in order to get a better understanding of the characteristics of the MDR/XDR TB gender was known for 95.9% (n = 757) of the cases, the gender-ratio M/F was 1.9:1. The age was available for 76.5% (n = 604) with a non-homogenous distribution, for female (p < 0.001). Information about the country of origin of the patient was available for 97.6% (n = 770); 49.6% (n = 382) were Spanish-born and 50.4% (n = 388) were foreign-born, from 34 different countries. The majority coming from Europe Region (40.1%), followed by the Americas the South-East Asian (3.2%) and patient in 55.2% and 14.7% of the cases, respectively. HIV status, intravenous drug user or alcohol abuse was a condition 20.7%, 13.1% and any additional were XDR, as they presented resistance to any fluoroquinolone and any of the three injectable aminoglycosides. Analysis of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristic differences. Young patients from 0 to 14 years old were more in cluster (65%) whereas the group aged were significantly associated clustering, = 1.34 (95% CI 1.01-1.78). The odds of belonging to a cluster was OR = 2.73 higher for patients with no previous tuberculosis (95% having a TB contact increased the likelihood of belonging to a cluster by OR = 2.71 (95% CI 1.52-4.98) and finally, XDR which Spain in our study by sending several samples our laboratory (Fig. [5](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig5)A). The geo-location of the isolates and the country of origin of the patients were investigated by clustering in order to clarify routes the disease. According to the of the isolates, 77 clusters were classified in Spanish-Regional-Clusters (n = 26), if all the isolates were detected in one region, or in Inter-Regional-Clusters (n = 51), if the involved cases came from two or more regions (Fig. [5](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig5)B). According to the country of origin of the cases, clusters were differentiated in Native-Cluster (n = 21) if grouped only Spaniard cases, Foreign-Clusters (n = 31) and Mixed-Clusters (n = 25), if both populations were included in a cluster. In order to know the impact of the importation of the MDR-TB in our country, we could observe that 19 of the Foreign-Clusters involved cases coming from a single country and that a foreign-born patient was the index case in 23 (71.9%) Mixed-Clusters. In a combined way, Cluster tb27, the most dispersed Interregional Cluster, geo-located in 8 different regions, was one of the largest Foreign Clusters, grouping 22 cases (Fig. [5](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#Fig5)B). an Inter-Regional- grouped 33 isolates in seven different regions. Notably, 14 of the 19 Foreign-Clusters involving cases coming from the same country were Inter-Regional-Clusters: six from Romania, three from Peru, two from the Russian Federation and three more clusters whose patients came from Ethiopia, Moldavia and Ukraine, respectively. Since 2009, 252 genotyping data were integrated these seven, participated in 20 European-clusters. Discussion This work presents the results of the molecular study of the MDR isolates identified in Spain from 1998 to 2017. During uninterrupted nationwide study, the molecular MIRU-VNTR recommended, whose [5](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR5), [12](#ref-CR12), surveillance in Europe, although standardization is still pending. Spain has incorporated this technology since 2018, combining with MIRU-VNTR to enable comparison with the previous obtained The use of WGS will provide of fixed for our study, a single isolation of each case of MDR-TB was realized. For the 9.6% of the cases, two or more samples were isolated and received in different years of the study. This could represent a proxy indicator of the fail of treatment. These data are consistent with those reported in a recent meta-analysis (8% failure or relapse) [19](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR19). The genotyping analysis of our study showed a 48.4% of clustering, which represents a respect to the 33.8% and 32.7% obtained by the Spanish network in three and eleven year follow-up periods [4](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR4), [5](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR5). This high percentage would not by the presence of the largest cluster bv1, as the major number of cases was registered in the first two years and consequently they were included in the prior studies. Besides, we have documented that some clusters persisted throughout the period of time studied, indicating overall increase in clustering. Few studies have been carried out in other low-incidence settings at the national level in a similar time-frame. At the European level, 19% of clustering was found in Denmark over 15 years. Other shorter studies realized in Germany showed 24.4% clustering, respectively, in seven years of follow-up [20](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR20). On the other hand, a recent should take us reconsider the time-frame as epidemiological studies majority of clusters identified in our to L4. This is consistent with previous cluster was along the period studied was not uniform. It was in the first year of study that the largest number, 12% of cases, was recorded. In contrast, the least number of cases was collected in the last year. It should be noted that the official sources to MDR-TB data [2](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR2). Otherwise, the country of origin of the cases studied reflects a parallelism with the phenomenon of immigration in Spain. In our study, the majority of cases were Spaniards until 2002, when foreign origin cases incremented. In the years following 2008, the decrease of cases observed can be explained by the \"Great Recession\" that affected an of immigrants [24](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR24). Likewise, most of the foreign-born cases came from the European Region and the Americas Region, and more specifically, from some of the highest-TB-burden countries in the EU/EEA, such as Romania [25](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR25). The descriptive analysis of the study population was in line with the classic facts for tuberculosis. The majority of our MDR-TB cases were male, although the M/F ratio was lower cases than those detected in EU/EEA [26](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR26). The average age of the population studied was around 40 years old, close to the 38.3 years of average age described in a recent meta-analysis study of 12 030 patients Spaniards. It is consistent with the profile of tuberculosis in Spain, with an average age of 51.2 years for native TB and 37.9 disease The excess percentage cases be bovis strain [22](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR22), [23](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR23), with the last case in our study in 2014. The analysis of the clusters according to the characteristic of the patients showed that was merely detected in Spaniards and mainly in the first two years of the study. Regarding the cluster duration, the most prolonged cluster was Beijing pattern2 cluster, an Inter-Regional and Foreign-Cluster, whose index case in accumulated until 2017. Impressively, this Beijing pattern2 cluster, the largest Beijing cluster identified in our study, accumulates 13 cases coming from five different East European countries and identified in 6 different detecting foreign MDR-TB, our study supports the need for a more discriminative tool for Beijing isolates, which is in agreement with other studies that remark that MIRU-VNTR is not lineage [18](/articles/s41598-020-77249-x#ref-CR18). A higher proportion of was found in occurring outside Spain. Most of these clusters were Inter-Regional-Clusters, what could be an indicative of importations of common strains from abroad. These patients could have arrived ill, or at least infected, to our country, what reports a cluster detected Equatorial Guinea, most of these cases developed MDR-TB within 3 months after their arrival. Similarly, for tb23, which included two adopted girls from present in TESSy, supports that they likewise circulating in Europe outside country. In contrast, the detection of 25 Mixed-Clusters makes us speculate the presence of transmission of MDR-TB in our own country. The present study is subject to a number of limitations. For instance, carried voluntarily. Nevertheless, counting the participation of the national reference laboratory for mycobacteria and with the agreement of 90% of the mycobacterial laboratories of the National Health System, allowed us to consider that our results should not from Notably, Spanish regions participated. Also, has to genetic analysed with two different techniques in two times-frames, were not detected as being clonally related. Finally, the health information systems do not disaggregate TB outcome data. In this sense, information on contact tracing, treatment outcome and complete resistance profile was only available for a variable proportion of patients, so these relationships could not be explored. Due to the limited discriminatory power of RFLP and MIRU-VNTR, tracing transmission was not elucidated, however, our study shows an approximate picture of the MDR strains that circulated in our country between WGS to future isolates would the present study. In conclusion, the continuity of genotyping for 20 years, together with the overlapping of standard methods used, has allowed us to create a real portrait of the circulating MDR/XDR strains over 18 years in Spain. Having a networked system and a long study period is an advantage over partial and short-term molecular studies. The report and centralisation of the genotypes in the European Union provides more information about the MDR-TB situation in Spain by finding similar genotype in other countries. The use of WGS, as an exclusive tool for existing data will reduce the traceability of cases and may make it difficult to monitor MDR-TB.
