Usually studied as a novelist, Manso was important beyond her literary production. As the first woman to be appointed to a government position and arguably the most radical feminist in nineteenth-century Manso's us about Argentine and education, and illustrates how a woman, who lived in Uruguay, Brazil, United States and Cuba, became a crucial transmitter of ideas about emerging nations and a living example of the interconnectedness of the Americas. Resumen: Este art\u00edculo considera a Juana Manso (1819&ndsh;1875) como un personaje clave en el proceso de construcci\u00f3n nacional argentino en el siglo XIX. Normalmente estudiada como novelista, Manso fue importante m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de su producci\u00f3n literaria. Como la primera mujer electa para ocupar una posici\u00f3n gubernamental y seg\u00fan algunos la feminista argentina m\u00e1s radical en el siglo XIX, la historia de Manso nos informa acerca del feminismo y la educaci\u00f3n en Argentina, e ilustra c\u00f3mo una mujer, que vivi\u00f3 en Uruguay, Brasil, EEUU y Cuba, fue una transmisora crucial de ideas sobre naciones emergentes y un ejemplo vivo de las interconexiones existentes en el continente.

Primeira a ser a um cargo governamental e possivelmente a feminista mais radical na Argentina do s\u00e9culo XIX, a hist\u00f3ria de Manso nos fala sobre o feminismo e a educa\u00e7\u00e3o argentina, e ilustra como uma mulher que viveu no Uruguai, Brasil, Estados Unidos e Cuba uma transmissora de id\u00e9ias a respeito um exemplo vivo da interconectividade das Am\u00e9ricas.

She founded O Jornal das Senhoras (1852), \u00c1lbum de Se\u00f1oritas (1854) and La Siempre Viva (1864) and contributed to other journals, published articles and letters in newspapers.

The depiction of Rosas's home in Misterios del Plata, pp. 57-60, is one of disorder: people come and go, they hang around, Rosas has dinner at irregular hours in the middle of the night and hardly sleeps. This creates chaos and is the opposite of healthiness and good values.

The Women's Movement in Argentina from its beginnings to Eva Per\u00f3n (Chicago 1988), p. 53. 52 Manso won a (posthumous) victory over the Sociedad. Her negative reiteration of the Sociedad (a depiction Sarmiento adhered to) took hold and in 1876 the state took over the girls' schools hitherto run by the Sociedad. The organisation expanded into private education and welfare. 53 Sarmiento to Mann, Oscawana, Julio 2 de 1866: '[Manso] has starting giving Lectures and is being rewarded with splendid success,' BAAL, 4 (1936), p. 107. 54 Details of Manso's conversion are few. Her affinity to Protestantism was evident in \u00c1lbum, 2 (January 8, 1854), pp. 10-11 where she defended Protestants' right to practice and preach. She taught at the American Methodist Episcopal Church Sunday School where she became close to the Rev. Henry G. Jackson, and teacher and librarian, W. D. Funor, both of whom spoke at her funeral. Velasco, Juana Paula Manso, pp. 123-4, refers to the latter as pastor and places Funor and her conversion at the 25 de Mayo church, which was British, but this may be a mistake. 55 Enrique M. de Santa Olalla, in Velasco, Juana Paula Manso, p. 324.

By 1872 Chivilcoy had completed building its library; so it wasn't that they were against the library, but against Manso. 63 She was one of five members on the Board, Anales, 9, 10 (May 1871), p. 298. There was a flurry of reform during Sarmiento's presidency (1868-1874), which included transport and communications, banking, land reform, federal law, the collection of national statistics and more. 64 Anales, 8 (July 1870), p. 317 (In Index Manso calls this volume 5); Anales, 9, 6 (January 1871), p. 169. 65 Anales, 10, 3 (October 1871), p. 65.

This was a bad precedent for these women, Anales, 10, 3 (October 1871), p. 73. 75 Some, while the in 'Escuela Anales, 8 (1869), p. 30, argued that foreign teachers may be better trained but they would not have the necessary patriotism for the sacrifices that school teaching required in Argentina. 76 Manso to Mary Mann, 25 November 1866, in Velasco, Juana Paula Manso, p. 157. 77 Manso to Mary Mann, September 1872, 'Letters to Mary Mann from Juana Manso,' typescript and translation by Luiggi, 1950. 78 Manso to Sarmiento, Buenos Aires, September 4, 1867, 'Letters ... ,' typescript and translation by Luiggi, 1950. 79 August 8, 1870 'Letters ... ,' typescript and translation by Luiggi, 1950.

Most of the small American community were Northerners and, as well as merchants, and in the role of education, as was, for example, the US Consul, Dexter Clapp, who after the Civil War was in charge of freedmen's education in a district in North Carolina. Manso was observing and extrapolating from a group at a very special time that drew even closer because of its expatriate condition. 81 Manso's review of Jos\u00e9 Manuel Estrada's 'Memoria sobre la educaci\u00f3n com\u00fan en la provincia de Buenos Aires', Anales, 9, 3 (October 1870), p. 75. 82 This quote and the two that follow are from Manso's 'Recuerdos de viaje', cited in Velasco, Juana Paula Manso, pp. 342-3; 347. 84 \u00c1lbum, 4 (22 January 1854), p. 28. 85 \u00c1lbum, 7 (12 February 1854), p. 49. 86 In Pennsylvania she had visited a centre for the blind, deaf and dumb, and a prison whose object was to rather than punish.

Quoted in Levy, 'Juana Manso,' p. 14. 97 writes, roles while Lewkowicz notes, 'In Juana Manso's [writings ] there is no petition for equal rights neither civil nor political'. Juana Paulo Manso, p. 71. Masiello's more complex view sees Manso wanting women to put their intellectual energies at the service of the nation, Between Civilization, pp. 53-4. This is accurate but fails stances; does portray these. 98 Anales, 4, 40 (October 1866), p. 72. 99 Frederick, Wily Modesty, pp. 15-42. 100 Hahner, Emancipating the 101 Sobre as minhas ideias da emancipac\u00e3o moral da mulher,' O Jornal das Senhoras (25 January 1852), p. 27. 102 Hahner, Emancipating the Female Sex, p. 26. 103 Anales, 10, 12 (July 1872), p. 364. The evolution of Manso's ideas is also suggested in her fiction. In her novel, Misterios del Plata, p. 85, for example, she defends Colonel Rojas, a 'noble' character, whose likely murder of his own wife is justified by her immoral behaviour. It is difficult to imagine the later Manso taking this 'blame the victim' stance. 104 Manso to Mary Mann, Anales, 7 (March 1869), p. 15. 105 Jo Burr Margadant, The New Biography, Performing Femininity in Nineteenth-Century France (Berkeley 2001). 106 Zuccotti, 'Entre la pose y la palabra,' p. 365. 107 One hangs in the Mitre Museum; the other opens the issue of Anales, 3, 26 (August 1865). 108 Anales, 3, 36 (June 1866), pp. 325-6. 109 'Any [educational] reforms that do not include the following solid bases are a waste of (June 1867), p. 339. 110 None of Manso's heroines - Gabriela in El Comendador or Adelaida in Misterios de Plata - are described as beautiful; rather they when she publicly called him 'stupid', Velasco, Juana Paula Manso, p. 185. 112 Anales, 7 (March 1869), p. 15. 113 Quoted in Velasco, Juana Paula Manso, p. 370. 114 Anales, 9, 6 (January 1871), p. 173. 115 The Standard (29 April 1875). 116 Asunci\u00f3n Lavrin, Women, Feminism, & Social Change in Argentina, Chile, & Uruguay, 1890-1940 (Lincoln 1995), p. 17. 117 Luiggi calls her that in Sixty Five Valiants, p. 27, but she is by means the only author to employ paternalistic terms for Manso. 118 Masiello, Between Civilization, pp. 20-1; the most insightful writer on this period is Tulio Halperin Donghi, Una Naci\u00f3n para el Desierto Argentino (Buenos Aires 2005). 119 Shumway, Invention of Argentina, pp. 27-43, 299.
