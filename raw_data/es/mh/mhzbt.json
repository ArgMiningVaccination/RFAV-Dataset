Major 48%. Prevalence was greater in males than in females (53% vs. 46%). By age group, deficiency was more prevalent in quartile 1 was greater in spring (nonsignificant differences with respect to winter) and lower in summer. The association between 25-(OH)D and PTH was assessed in include female sex (OR, 1.27), OR 1.63, spring OR 1.16), and age (quartile 1, OR, 3). Conclusions The prevalence 25-(OH)D deficiency differed according to sex, and year. Furthermore, elevation of PTH is mainly influenced by low 25-(OH)D, female sex, season, and age. "}
