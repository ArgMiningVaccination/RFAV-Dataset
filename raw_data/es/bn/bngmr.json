Making it to 90 years old is awe-inspiring in much of the world. But as recently reported on National Public Radio (NPR), on a tiny Greek island in the North Aegean Sea, nonagenarians barely merit a second glance. According to NPR, the island of Icaria could be the newest of the world's so-called blue zones \u2014 places where residents have unusually long life spans. Dan Buettner has crossed the globe many times over the years in search of blue zones, and he recently teamed up with AARP and National Geographic to study Icaria. They found Icaria had the highest percentage of 90-year-olds anywhere on the planet \u2014 nearly 1 out of 3 people make it to their 90s. Plus, Buettner says, \"they have about 20 percent lower lower rates disease and almost dementia.\" Our life spans are about 20 percent dictated by our genes, Buettner says. The rest is lifestyle. People in Icaria live in mountain villages that necessitate activity every day. \"They have gardens,\" he says, for example. \"If they go to church, if they go to their friends' house \u2014 it always occasions a small walk. But that ends up burning much more calories than going to a gym for 20 minutes fruits and vegetables.\" It's high in greens; about 150 veggies grow wild on the island. \"These greens have somewhere around 10 times the level of antioxidants in red wine.\" Particularly unusual to this drinking habits. Icarians drink herbal teas says. The herbal teas it turns out have diuretics, which lower blood pressure, explaining the lower rates of heart disease. \"That's something we haven't seen in Okinawa or Costa Rica or Sardinia or any of the other blue zones,\" Buettner says. - [La llorona del 20 de septiembre de 2023](/opinion/la-llorona/230920/llorona-20-septiembre-2023) - [Juan Carlos Ara\u00faz: Asamblea no debe rechazar el contrato minero](/nacional/230920/juan-carlos-arauz-asamblea-debe) - [La Opini\u00f3n Gr\u00e1fica del 20 de septiembre de 2023](/opinion/opinion-grafica/230920/opinion-grafica-20-septiembre-2023) - [Asamblea Nacional concluye consultas sobre contrato entre el Estado y Minera Panam\u00e1](/nacional/230920/asamblea-concluye-consultas) - [Cortizo y Petro hablan sobre migraci\u00f3n irregular, pero sin avances](/nacional/230920/cortizo-petro-hablan-migracion) - [Ricardo Martinelli anunciar\u00e1 a su compa\u00f1ero de f\u00f3rmula este domingo](/nacional/politica/230920/ricardo-martinelli-anunciara-companero-formula-domingo) - [Muere Philip Pascall, cofundador y presidente de First Quantum](/economia/230919/muere-philip-pascall-cofundador-presidente-first-quantum) - [Acodeco analiza supuestas exclusividades en el Festival de la Mejorana](/nacional/230919/acodeco-analiza-supuestas-exclusividades-festival-mejorana) - [Cobre Panam\u00e1 inaugura puente peatonal sobre el r\u00edo San Juan](/nacional/230919/cobre-panama-inaugura-puente-peatonal-rio-san-juan) - [Empresa interesada en proyecto de Panamericana este mantiene "}
