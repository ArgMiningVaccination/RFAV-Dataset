Como resultado, los investigadores deben evaluar e intentar minimizar todos los riesgos previsibles involucrados en la investigaci\u00f3n propuesta, y los miembros de los comit\u00e9s de \u00e9tica en investigaci\u00f3n deben evaluar y hacer un balance de los riesgos y beneficios potenciales implicados en cada propuesta de investigaci\u00f3n como parte de sus obligaciones \u00e9ticas respecto de los protocolos de investigaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, la literatura actual proporciona escasas gu\u00edas sobre los detalles espec\u00edficos de c\u00f3mo debe ocurrir este proceso de equilibrio. En consecuencia, este art\u00edculo ofrece algunos detalles del proceso para equilibrar los riesgos y beneficios en la investigaci\u00f3n biom\u00e9dica y les recuerda a los miembros de los comit\u00e9s de \u00e9tica de investigaci\u00f3n su responsabilidad de proteger a aquellos que son vulnerables a la explotaci\u00f3n en proyectos de investigaci\u00f3n.

Aarons D. Research ethics. West Indian Med J. 1995;44(4):115-8.. The chairperson of the committee will determine whether the research proposal requires a full review by all committee members, whether it qualifies for expedited review by a few committee members, or whether the research proposal falls into the category of exemption from ethics review. On members an adequate assessment the research proposal, ensuring that the seven ethical requirements for research with human subjects are met 22. Emanuel EJ, Wendler D, Grady C. makes the possible value the research, the scientific validity of the proposed methodology, a fair selection process for research participants, a favorable balance of the foreseeable risks and possible benefits of the research endeavour and an evaluation regarding the welfare of the proposed research participants. The concept includes that all participants are respected throughout the research process, that their personal information will standards 33. Council of Medical Sciences. International guidelines for biomedical that much discussion has occurred regarding risks and benefits in research, however, no publication was found that could guide research ethics committee members and researchers regarding levels and possible categories, benefits (whether to individuals, communities, or to This article therefore seeks to provide detailed guidance on some of these issues, against the background of possible exploitation in some research endeavours. What is 'risk' in research? Risk in research is the probability of loss, injury or other adverse someone as a result of their participation in a research study 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in biomedical research. the International RedBioetica/Unesco. Costa Rica: Ministry of Health; 2016.. Customarily, when any risk of harm is mentioned, physical harm instantly comes to mind, and people usually only think about the risk of physical injury to their person. However, the concept of harm may occur during research projects, includes aspects such as physical, moral, psychological, social, legal, and financial harm. The risk of physical harm includes a risk of illness, injury, pain, and others ailments that are (e.g. injury during invasive medical procedures or from of research drug) 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in the International Congress of RedBioetica/Unesco. Costa Rica: Ministry of Health; 2016.. The concept of moral harm begins with a respect for the person and their well-being, with specific recognition and respect being to a integrity 55. Aarons D. Ethical issues surrounding body integrity and research. West Indian Med J. 2014;63(5):399-400b.. The underlying issue here is that all human beings have moral worth, and through the nature of that moral worth, respect is due to them, their dignity, and their body integrity. As a result, people should have full control over their bodies, their personal information, and their body tissue. If one wishes to use their information or body tissue for research (e.g. tissue extracted during routine or emergency surgery), even if anonymously, that or body tissue is theirs, so their permission should be sought in advance. Failure to do so is to cause moral harm to their dignity and integrity. Risk of psychological harm includes the risk of production of negative states or altered behavior, including anxiety, depression, guilt, shock, feelings of worthlessness, or fear 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in biomedical research. the International Congress of RedBioetica/Unesco. Costa Rica: Ministry of Health; 2016.. These occur research participants are or stressed as a result of their involvement in the research. Risk of social harm includes a possible risk involving the disruption of research friends, associates, civic and religious communities) or a change in their relationships with others, and may involve stigmatization, embarrassment, or a loss of respect. It may occur, for example, if there is an inadvertent disclosure of sensitive or embarrassing information (e.g. HIV infection or mental illness). A risk of legal harm includes the risk of discovery of and prosecution for criminal conduct, for instance, if information about illegal substance abusers were revealed to the police 44. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in biomedical research. the International RedBioetica/Unesco. Costa Rica: Ministry of Health; 2016.. Risks of financial or economic harm include the risk of an incurrence or the imposition of financial burdens, hardships or direct or indirect financial costs for participants due to their involvement in the research project. This can occur, for a to 'Risk' a word expressing 'probabilities', when used in relation to research, it is expressing the probability of harm occurring during the research endeavour. In this regard, risks in biomedical research may be classified as minimal, low, medium and high risk 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in biomedical research. the International RedBioetica/Unesco. Costa Rica: Ministry of Health; Minimum risk This is in fact the least risk. There is no 'no risk', since once patients are involved in research, at the very least they lose personal time, which they might otherwise be spending in their personal life pursuits in research and its the very least some minimal apprehension for research participants, so has psychological consequences. As a result, research should never state 'no risk is and measuring research participants in an area or subject that is not controversial, provided that the procedures are carried out in a sensitive way and that consent has been given 66. Caribbean Public Health Agency. Research ethics committee. CARPHA. Trinidad & Tobago; 2014. p. 11.. In biomedical research, this category also includes the collection of a single urine sample and using blood from a sample that had already been taken as a part of routine health care management. Most projects in cultural and social science research are generally classified as minimal risk because they usually involve very little risk of physical harm 77. The National Committee for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences and the Humanities. Guidelines for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences, Law and the Humanities. Norway; 2006. p. 12.. However, due to possible risk of significant psychological harm occurring in some research, as very strong stimuli (e.g. studies containing violence or pornography), or if they may cause long-term mental harm (e.g. depression, sleeplessness) beyond the risks encountered in normal life, then those projects may deserve classification into other categories, depending on the particular circumstances 88. National Advisory Board on Research Ethics. Ethical principles of research in the humanities and social and behavioural sciences and proposals for ethical review. The National Advisory Board on Research Ethics' Proposals. Helsinki; 2009. p. 3.. Some social science research projects may even deserve being classified as high risk if the research carries a significant security risk to participants (e.g. domestic violence with risk of death) 88. National Advisory Board on Research Ethics. Ethical principles of research in the humanities and social and behavioural sciences and proposals for ethical review. The National Advisory Board on Research Ethics' Proposals. Helsinki; 2009. p. 3.. Low risk In biomedical research, one would insert or tenderness, or small bruises and possibly small scars 66. Caribbean Public Health Agency. Research ethics committee. CARPHA. Trinidad & Tobago; 2014. p. 11.. We should note that when children are involved in research, they are invariably apprehensive, so any use needles and 'high' risk, and such judgements are best made by a research ethics committee. Note that biomedical research that involves, for example, one or two radiographic (X-ray) pictures taken of the abdomen of a pregnant woman would carry more than low risk to the fetus, but the research may still be allowed by the research ethics committee if there is a commensurate greater benefit to be obtained for the particular pregnant woman from the outcome of the research. High risk In biomedical research, this category of risk usually involves research that procedures Such procedures for research should only be carried out when the research is combined with diagnosis and treatment that is intended to benefit the particular research participants experimental treatment agents are also classified as high risk 66. Caribbean Public Health Agency. Research ethics committee. CARPHA. Trinidad & Tobago; 2014. p. 11.. Benefits of research 'Benefit' is a word expressing a fact or state of affairs, so when this term is used during research planning or the stages of review, really use the term 'potential not a should also that in research, benefits in more than one area. They might only in the individual (concrete benefits to research participants) or may result in a benefit to society (when research is viewed as a social good, for the benefit of current and future generations). Research should never be allowed to proceed unless there an of some anticipated or potential benefit, whether that outcome benefit is new knowledge or confirmation of the results of other research previously conducted. The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) publishes the CIOMS International Guidelines, 33. Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. International guidelines for biomedical a variety of interventions may be involved in research, some of which may have possible direct therapeutic benefits, while other research may involve non-beneficial interventions, such as when research is research question. Thus, or expertise for the researchers or the research institution. Individual research participants may physically benefit through direct social welfare or through institutions that support their well-being. Research may also benefit a local community 33. Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. International guidelines for biomedical health services, improved lives and livelihood for members of the community, a reduced patient burden on the health care system, solutions to health care problems, a curtailing of increasing health care costs and the creation of a knowledge-intensive health care industry 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in biomedical research. the International Congress RedBioetica/Unesco. Rica: of Health; The of & benefits Both the of risks as well as the 'magnitude' of possible harm must be considered at this stage. This means the probability or likelihood that harm will occur and the magnitude of the harm, including its consequences 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and the International making this assessment, we should ask: How likely is this particular harm to occur (probability)? After answering that question, we should then ask: How large is this harm likely to be, if it occurs (magnitude)? What effect is it likely risks to research proposals to meet this ethical requirement, a favorable risk to benefit ratio must exist. In other words, the risks must be lower other words, the benefits that may accrue to the individual or to the society must outweigh the potential risks to the research participants. More importantly, the more likely or more severe the potential risks, the greater the magnitude of the prospective benefits should be 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits research. the International Congress RedBioetica/Unesco. Rica: this research ethics committees should aware that may offer direct benefits to research participants, such as those who are suffering from a particular illness who may be amenable to the treatment being tested. In the latter scenario, the participants may be willing to accept risks or treatment side-effects that would have likely been deemed unacceptable by others who are not suffering Consequently, should be based on the available information in the research protocol as well as a full appreciation of the context 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and in the International Congress continue to provide the tested treatment research participants when the research project has ended, particularly when local health care services do not provide such treatments. This is an important justice issue for participants involved in health research in Southern countries (lower and middle income countries - LMIC), and becomes even more crucial when participants are near the end of life and their health condition is incurable. Research ethics the risk/benefit To arrive at a judgment regarding the ethical acceptability of the risks in proposed research, it is essential members of research ethics committees identify all the and who will be 44. Aarons DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in the International Congress RedBioetica/Unesco. will include possible but may involve assessing the risk to others existing outside (e.g. in genomic research may participants). The must assess the likelihood and magnitude of the risks, as well as the extent to which the risks then exercise its judgment on the matter, and balance the two sides of the issue! Some ways to minimize be procedures with sound research vary with the particular methodology used, should be the uppermost goal during design stages of the research. For example, in assessing the research design, we should note that the magnitude of possible benefits. there would be a risk of wasting research participants' time, plus exposing them to research whose outcome may not be The project should therefore is to successfully carry out the proposed DE. Risk/benefits balance and exploitation in the International Rica: Ministry of Health; Exploitation in biomedical research Health and biomedical research seeks to benefit all members of society, but greater attention should be given to those research endeavours that involve those who may be considered vulnerable or disenfranchised 99. Aarons DE. Research: an ethical answer in addressing our people's health problems inequities. West Indian Med J. 2015:64(Suppl 2);97-100.. Vulnerability indicates a state of being exposed, being easily hurt, or being susceptible to physical harm or emotional injury 1010. Straehle C. Vulnerability, measuring vulnerability in young they have a reduced ability to protect themselves Issues bioethics: teaching research ethics. West Indian Med J. 2003;52(2):145-50.. They may not have enough education or intelligence, political power, resources, strength or other attributes that are needed to protect their own best interests. The CIOMS International Guidelines specifically state that special justification must be provided for inviting vulnerable persons to participate in research, and if they are selected, then there should be adequate protection of their rights and welfare 33. Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. International guidelines for biomedical prioritize those whose health is relatively worse off, due to their disenfranchised position in the lower socio-economic strata of society 99. Aarons DE. Research: an ethical answer in addressing our people's health problems and inequities. West Indian Med J. 2015:64(Suppl 2);97-100.. The prevailing socio-economic systems in many low and middle-income countries are shaped and driven by capitalism and capitalist inclinations by those in power within those societies. In many of those systems, the private sector's main and sometimes sole interest is in itself and its shareholders. It therefore behooves the state and civil society to seek to cushion the full effects of economic policies that do not seek benefit or guarantee the welfare for those in the lower socio-economic strata of the society. In these circumstances, biomedical research should focus on what ameliorating practical interventions could be made on their behalf, in order to elevate their health and socio-economic status. Priority should then be given to this type of research 99. Aarons DE. Research: an ethical answer in addressing our people's health problems and inequities. West Indian Med J. 2015:64(Suppl 2);97-100.. The major ethical issue in situations of vulnerability and disenfranchisement is the matter of justice, which requires that there be an equitable distribution of the benefits and burdens of research. No group should receive in the burdens. There are specific persons or groups that are traditionally considered to be vulnerable, as they have limited mental capacity or limited freedom to consent or to decline participation in research 33. Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. International guidelines for biomedical with mental or behavioral disorders that render them incapable of providing informed with good mental capacity may still be regarded as being in vulnerable situations, such as when they are in junior positions in a hierarchical group or society, or are institutionalized in situations that involved in health care or research training, employees in pharmaceutical companies, members of a country's national security forces or the elderly in nursing homes. Despite all the needs include such subjects, as they and their particular ailment may benefit from the outcome of the particular research endeavour (e.g., pregnant women who may benefit from research on particular drugs or vaccines). Depending on the circumstance, vulnerable persons should not be excluded from research, but instead extra precautions should be undertaken to protect them DE. Issues in Indian Med J. 2003;52(2):145-50.. Further, because these people are vulnerable, they should be protected from exploitation. Exploitation refers to a state of affairs where a person or people in positions of power and influence unfairly take advantage of a person or group's vulnerability in order to profit or benefit themselves 1313.

Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. International guidelines for biomedical proposed research, are the research participants being exploited? 2) Is there a fair balancing of the benefits, burdens, and risks for these research participants? 3) Is their community being over-researched? 4) If there will be no direct benefits to the participants, will their local community or society benefit from the research? Current and historic asymmetry of resources and influence between countries of the North and countries of the South have made many LMIC Southern countries 'vulnerable' and therefore more susceptible to exploitation 1616. Aarons DE. Family health, public health, and vulnerability caribbean committees should therefore be sensitive to all these issues and seek to protect all people from possible ethics committees are to assess the level of risk to research participants, determine the possible benefits from the research, and weigh and balance these two foreseeable potentials to determine whether the particular judgements Emanuel EJ, Wendler D. Evaluating the risks of clinical research. Jama. 2010;304(13):1472-9.. International research ethics guidelines state that clinical research is only ethical when the research risk to participants is reasonable 1818. Wendler D, Miller FG. Assessing of risk may arise in the particular research (e.g. risk of physical harm, psychological harm, social harm, financial or economic harm or legal harm). They should then determine the level of risk (minimal, low, medium or high) for each of the in the Each identified of risk with its commensurate level of risk should be listed or delineated on a chart. Committee members should then seek to determine the possible benefits, if any, from the proposed research. Special care should be taken as social benefits may sometimes be uncertain 2020. Miller FG, Joffe S. Limits to research risks. J Med Ethics. 2009;35(7):397-9.. These may be stated in the particular research proposal, but committee members should make such a determination the potential benefits of the research would accrue to the research participants or to the society, as well as whether that potential benefit is in the form of new knowledge or the confirmation of previous research. Delineation should be made regarding whether research may or benefit accrue to the local communities from which the particular research participants may come, which could take the form of improvement in local health services that would benefit the lives and livelihood of other members of the local community. Documentation of any potential benefits to the wider society should also be made and this may take the form of increased knowledge and insights that may spawn new research into related fields. Considering all of the the effects if those risks materialize. A should be made research project P, particular research endeavour should then be analytically compared on paper or visually on a chart, focused on determining whether the anticipated benefits are so large in their and scope as to outweigh the various predictable risks having and magnitude of the potential benefits arising from the research will outweigh the likelihood and magnitude of harms if they occur, once all the other ethical requirements for biomedical research have been met. seek to denote all foreseeable risks associated with their research projects 2323.

J stated as referring to the individual research participants, their health care system (or similar), people in their local community, or for the wider society. Ethical weights will have to be given to research reflects the health needs of the population to be researched. It will be the responsibility of research ethics committees to ensure that communities within their particular jurisdiction are not over-researched, and they should not approve research where participants may be exploited. Particularly in low the research should either directly benefit the research participants, their local community or society as a whole. Refer\u00eancias - 1Aarons D. Research ethics.
