Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews on the use medicinal plants with 10 local informants, and categorized the kinds of diseases treated by traditional medicine. We obtained reports of cases treated at the Hospital of Huacareta in order to compare the use frequency of traditional medicine and allopathic medicine for the treatment of recurrent diseases in the area. Results Our survey identified 258 traditional medicine uses, spanning a total of 13 diseases categories and including 91 native and exotic plant species and one unidentified sample plant type. Gastrointestinal disorders (55%) were most frequently treated with medicinal plants, followed by afflictions of the musculoskeletal system (25%) and dermatological disorders (24%). Hospital information indicates that the most common diseases are acute respiratory infections (47%) and acute diarrheal diseases (37%). The herbal remedies were mostly used in the form of teas and decoctions. The informants used mainly native plant species, although exotic species has been introduced to the pharmacopoeia. Conclusions The treatment of gastrointestinal disorders is the primary objective of the medical ethnobotany of the inhabitants of Huacareta, while respiratory system diseases are mostly treated in the hospital. Looking at the data from the Hospital records we can infer that gastrointestinal disorders are among the most common diseases in the study area. For most respondents, traditional medicine is a reliable choice for the care of their illnesses. However, the preference of the population for either traditional medicine or allopathic medicine needs to be clarified in future comparative studies to obtain more convincing results. The results presented can be used as a base for subsequent work related to traditional medicine and its contribution to allopathic medicine in San Pablo de Huacareta.

Los resultados expuestos pueden ser usados como una base de datos para posteriores trabajos relacionados a la medicina tradicional y su contribuci\u00f3n con la medicina alop\u00e1tica en San Pablo de Huacareta. Background San Pablo de Huacareta is located in a transition zone of valleys between the Andes and the Bolivian Chaco. It contains an interesting blend of Chaco and Andean plant species. Likewise, the human population in the area is composed of people of mixed descent, Quechua and Guarani, whose culture is rooted in Chaco which is still maintained. [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1), [2](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR2)]. In this sense, it is interesting to be able to evaluate the medicinal ethnobotany of a population who presents the characteristics previously exposed. In Bolivia the impact of hospitals and health posts only became important for the general population after 1975, when the government increased their number by over 80%. Nevertheless, rural communities in Bolivia are still relying on traditional medicine to treat everyday illnesses [ [3](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR3)]. The use of medicinal plants to treat a wide variety of diseases has been often noted [ [4](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR4)- [7](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR7)]. According to the World Health Organization, up to 90% of the population in developing countries relies on traditional medicine and medicinal plants to meet primary health care need [ [8](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR8)]. In spite of the permanent loss of cultural practices worldwide, and also in Bolivia, traditional medicine still is very much a part of daily life in the rural areas [ [3](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR3), [9](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR9)]. Therefore, research on traditional forms of medicine and the exploration of the possible use of medicinal plants in primary health care is required to understand the extent of use and effectiveness of these practices. There exists some interest at the international level to systematize the information on the use of medicinal plants for each region [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1), [10](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR10)]. Previous research has that 80% of people in developing countries use traditional medicine to meet their primary healthcare needs, and about 85% of a traditional medicine involves the use of plant extracts [ [11](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR11)]. No data on the medicinal plants used by local people in Huacareta existed prior to this study. Previous reports only indicated in general terms that the practice of traditional medicine was mainly rooted cultural the and cultural appreciation of the traditional medicine by indigenous groups and mestizos. Most research has been conducted in Cochabamba [ [3](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR3), [5](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR5), [13](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR13)- [16](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR16)]; Santa Cruz [7](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR7)], and the ethnopharmacological uses of medicinal plants in rural indigenous or mestizo communities in Chuquisaca was virtually unknown [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)]. It is important to keep in mind that the data obtained in this study come from interviews with mestizo informants who keep a daily practice of using traditional medicine. They obtained their knowledge from their parents and grandparents. The common ancestry establishes a single source Chaco ethnicity, because the cultural mix that exists in the area today this does not allow us to assess the original cultural origin of the traditional knowledge and local uses of medicinal plants correspond to Hispanic, location ethnobotanical approach the study of the meanings plants acquire in a particular cultural framework. In a study of this nature, therefore, the medicinal uses of plants are contextualized within the various practices associated with curation as defined by local people. For this reason, we also present a preliminary outline of their ethnomedicinal practice to facilitate the understanding of the role assigned to the use of medicinal plants. The aim of this study was to document the types of diseases treated by the use of medicinal plants, their main applications and also to have a report of the major diseases treated at the Hospital of San Pablo de Huacareta. Research area climate and vegetation San Pablo de Huacareta (20\u00b0 21' 49.1\" S, town with roughly 2900 inhabitants of mixed mestizo (Spanish, Quechua, Guarani) origin and is located at the convergence of the Chuquisaca valley and the Bolivian Chaco (Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija). Huacareta is located in the South of Hernando Siles province, in the Chuquisaca Department at an elevation of about 1090 m [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)]. There are two access roads with daily transportation from Monteagudo and Entre R\u00edos, both medium-sized cities linked to larger cities, such as Santa Cruz, Tarija, and Yacuiba (Figure [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#Fig1)). The climate is xeric to sub-humid with rainfall of 900-1100 mm per year. The average maximum temperature is 25\u00b0C, the minimum average is 12.2\u00b0C. Extreme in recent years were a minimum of -2\u00b0C and a maximum of 35\u00b0C. The land in the study area is mainly by used for agriculture and livestock. Important tree species Acacia aroma, and Celtis tala[ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1), [2](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR2)]. Ethnography The early twentieth century saw the start of the migration of people of Quechua and mestizo origin to Azurduy, Zuda\u00f1ez, and Tomina provinces, attracted by the wealth on the foundation of Canton Huacareta are imprecise, but there is reference to the first settlements between 1925 and 1945. As late as 1945, the population of San Pablo de Huacareta was primarily of Guarani origin, and the ownership of the territory was family based. However veterans of the Chaco War settled in the area and engaged in agricultural activities. These families of mixed or mestizo the Guarani [ [20](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR20)]. 1952 did not promote major changes in the structure of land tenure [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)].Nowadays, the 2900 residents of Huacareta are mostly of mixed mestizo (Spanish, Quechua, and Guarani) descent, having come originally from the valleys of Chuquisaca and Bolivian Chaco (Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija). These people are mostly Catholic and engage in agriculture and livestock production on the plains. Generally, farms in the area are dominated by maize (Zea mays) and to a lesser extent (Capsicum sp.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea), towards diversification, with the cultivation of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) even potato (Solanum tuberosum) [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1), [21](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR21)]. These products are brought to major urban centers such as Santa Cruz, Sucre and Tarija. There is a tendency for the local population to migrate to the cities in search of new employment opportunities and economic prosperity [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)]. Health care Hospital in Huacareta serves a small patient population and not everyone in the region use the hospital. Factors that hinder access to health services include the large distance between the center and the isolated communities, difficult access due to the flooding of the rivers in the rainy season and roads that are passable only at certain times of the year. The infrastructure and hospital equipment have deteriorated over the years and are no longer sufficient. However, patients covered by the SUMI (Seguro Universal Materno Infantil) have access to ambulance service, which allows transfers to more central health care facilities (e.g. the Hospital of Monteagudo). San Pablo runs a program of child immunization and supplements minerals and vitamins, as well to recent data, 36.4% of the population care for their health through traditional medicine, while the remaining population use the hospital [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)]. Methods Ethnobotanical data were collected between May and November, 2010, on farms and hamlets near the town of San Pablo Huacareta. The areas surveyed were selected according to accessibility and willingness of residents to share their knowledge about the use of medicinal plants.Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 local informants (4 men and 6 women) after establishing prior informed consent. Their ages ranged between 55 and 70. Six informants were healers with medium experience practicing only occasionally at home, who obtained their knowledge from their parents grandparents, experience, who retained extensive knowledge in the use and application of plant medicines. These healers attended to 30% of the population of San Pablo. One healer can serve up to ten patients a day, usually Monday through Friday and in special cases may also attend on the weekends. The local healers traditional at least two informants identify the same part of the same medicinal plant for the identical medicinal use [ [4](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR4)]. We categorized the diseases reported in this investigation in Frei Susana Arr\u00e1zola [ [5](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR5), [22](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR22)], whose study is based parts affected by an illness (e.g. respiratory system, skin, gastrointestinal tract, circulatory system, etc.), that were treated through using in results. addition Hospital San Pablo de Huacareta was visited to obtain data on the number of cases treated during the period of 2009-2010 (1669 cases) of the same diseases in order to compare the use of traditional medicine and Western medicine. Seventy-five patients at the hospital were randomly selected and interviewed about the factors influencing their preferences in the use of either the hospital or traditional medicine, after either at the or Patients asked illness?\" The respective were conducted the fieldwork. Vouchers of all plants were collected directly in the with the assistance two healers. The plants were identified and specimens were deposited in the Herbario Nacional Forestal Mart\u00edn C\u00e1rdenas in Cochabamba (BOLV) under the collection series RQ. The interviews were recorded in field notebooks and worksheets and later digitized. Results A total of 258 medicinal uses were recorded for a total of 91 native and exotic plant species belonging to 40 families and one unidentified sample. These medicinal applications fell into a total of [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#Tab1), Table used plant parts, with the resin and Most prepared by simply boiling the ingredients (47 species, 53%) and were administered as tea (40 species, 50%). This was especially true for treating digestive disorders, liver and kidney; without the application method of choice (Figure [2](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#Fig2)). In some cases, plant parts like leaves and fruits were heated over a fire and then applied to the affected area (7 species, fields. Usually shrubs and herbs used in traditional medicine were branches were and trauma associated with joints, bones. The most widely used means of administration was the application of heated plant materials, often in a bath, which were derived from branches and leaves. Mixed leaves of Schinus molle, plants were applied as a poultice or in a bath, in most cases. The most frequently used plant parts were leaves, roots, both women and childbirth forms these ailments. The most widely used parts 17% of all plants found, mostly in the form of teas. used well as conditions like heat stroke were treated with 16% of the medicinal plants encountered. These problems were addressed by cooking roots, branches, and leaves to prepare a tea for the patient or to apply the material as disorders of the heart and circulatory as well as diseases described as \"of the by the informants. percent of the plants found were prepared as teas to cardiovascular problems. leaves as blood purifier. Central nervous disorders Central nervous system disorders (7%) were treated mostly by drinking tea. Citrus delicious, Lactuca sativa, and Citrus aurantium were most frequently used relieve nervous stress. Other diseases Among the diseases treated to were diabetes, headache, earache, toothache, and viral diseases. In all cases, the remedies were administered as herbal teas. For the treatment of earache fruits of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were applied directly to the ear, after first heating them over a fire. Overall, we found that most plants are reportedly used for the treatment of gastrointestinal by plants (22 species, 24%), and diseases of the genitourinary complex (18 species, 20%). Most applications subsequently dealt the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders (85 applications, 33%), disorders of the musculoskeletal system (40 (Figure indicated that recurrent diseases 1669 cases reported throughout the year. Skeletto-muscular problems and skin diseases incidence (4% 8% respectively) (Table [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#Tab1)), these conditions can be cured by the use of medicinal plants, for example, a type of skin allergy is commonly are treated with medicinal plants (19 uses, 7%). The numbers often associated with a particular ritual. Likewise, some types of skin allergies are cured by a ritual and the use of medicinal plants, e.g. Senecio aff. rudbeckiifolius. Although hospital records showed a incidence in the treatment of diseases of the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal disorders, we found that children ranging from 0-9 years had a higher incidence of cases of acute disorders (72% in total) and acute gastrointestinal problems (68% in total) within the total (Table [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#Tab1)), the remainder corresponding to patients aged 10 and over 60 years of age. These data show the importance of the hospital in providing health care to children under the age of 10 years, who often suffer from diarrhea, intestinal parasites, and respiratory infections. In conversations 67 out of 75 informants mentioned a preference for the use of medicinal plants instead of going to the hospital. This could mainly be linked to the distrust that people have in doctors. Another important aspect was the limited financial resources the purchase of pharmaceuticals. Often people consult doctors at the hospital, then turn to traditional healers for treatment with medicinal plants, because this cure has a lower cost. However, the preference for traditional medicine over allopathic (63 species) were native (i.e., they occurred naturally in the study area) and were applied in 69% of all reported remedies efforts, and were used in 31% of all applications (78). The most prominent species were Carica papaya and wheat, in the local market. The rest were cultivated in home gardens or in fields. Discussion Digestive system disorders are very common, especially in rural areas, in particular in the Andes, the Amazon and the Chaco. Numerous papers on medical ethnobotany explain the use of medicinal plants for the treatment of these conditions in the valleys and the Chaco region of [17](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR17)- important to note that most drinking water in the area comes from natural sources such as streams, and there is no drinking water treatment. The water is however regarded as safe, as it passes through a is supposedly that the highest percentage of plants (55%) and applications (85 applications, 33%) intended to treat gastrointestinal disorders. liver. Similar plant use was observed in other rural areas of the Bolivian Chaco, indicating the importance of traditional medicine in the of gastrointestinal disorders [7](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR7), [17](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR17), [19](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR19)]. It needs to be emphasized, that water treatment would be the most important step towards the eradication of major health problems such dysentery in rural areas of developing countries such as Bolivia, Argentina, or Paraguay [ [4](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR4)]. In addition to gastro-intestinal problems, decoctions), as well as use of poultices and the direct application of plant material producing a cooling effect on the patient's body in order to treat body aches, skin diseases and fever has commonly been reported [ [24](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR24), [25](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR25)]. The data obtained in the hospital indicate that the hospital, while the traditional use of medicinal plants is restricted to the treatment of common colds as an alternative in particular to reduce costs of treatment. Similar trends have been informants (67 of 75) to prefer traditional medicine, are low income, lack of confidence in western doctors at the hospital, and also the long tradition to use plant based medicine [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)]. Studies in Cochabamba [ [15](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR15), [16](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR16)] to of traditional healers, doctors reasons to continue the use traditional medicine. Some studies in the area indicate that 36.4% meet their health through traditional medicine and the remainders in formal centers [ [1](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR1)], the main causes are the inaccessibility or availability of financial resources, lack of transportation, distance, and a higher confidence in traditional healers. The where doctors and The Hospital has 48 general practitioners, 9 midwives and works now with at least 5 traditional healers especially for a healing alternative to the use of medicinal plants and to reduce costs. A similar approach was observed in the Cochabamba Valley purchase in particular if they receive social security benefits. We found that plant species collected by the population of Huacareta from the forest areas and fields surrounding the house are mostly native species (68%), while only 32% are exotics. grown in gardens or, [ [26](/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-8-29#ref-CR26)], and patients often buy these species in the local market or from other cities and towns. Similar results were found in traditional creole medicine in the northwestern Chaco of the used native to 5% were either grown in gardens or purchased. Conclusions In this study we found that Huacareta inhabitants use ethnomedicine mostly for the treatment of gastrointestinal Their pharmacopoeia contains a wide range of herbal remedies for these afflictions, while diseases of the respiratory system are only treated with a small number of medicinal plants. For these diseases patients prefer to go to the hospital. Looking at the data from the Hospital records, we found that gastrointestinal disorders are among the most common diseases in the study area. In addition we found that cases of diarrhoea and parasitoses in children under 5 years are mostly treated with allopathic medicine. Most respondents indicated that traditional medicine is the best option in the care of their illnesses. However, the preference of the population for native plants that grow in the fields and along paths in the area. Some exotics were introduced into the pharmacopoeia and are now are cultivated in home gardens and sold in the market. The results presented in this paper can be used as a base for future work related to the traditional use of medicinal plants and their contribution to allopathic medicine in San Pablo de Huacareta.
