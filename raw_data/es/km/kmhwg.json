This means preparing to be sealed as a worthy husband or wife and to become a loving father or mother. For some, these blessings will not be fulfilled until the next life, but the ultimate goal is the same for all. Faithful members whose circumstances do not allow blessings of eternal marriage and parenthood in this will receive all promised blessings in the eternities, provided they keep the covenants made with God (see [Mosiah 2:41](/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41?lang=eng#p41)). 38.1.5 Unwed Parents under Age 18 An unwed young man under age 18 who is going to become a father may participate in his Aaronic Priesthood in left to the prayerful discretion of the young man, his parents, and the bishop. An unwed young woman under age 18 who is going to become a mother may participate in Young Women or in Relief Society.

Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing may also use sign language or a voice-to-text to understand the blessings given to their written of patriarchal blessings, blessings are sacred. For this reason, no one should take photographs or make video recordings of ordinances, blessings, or baptismal services. A family may make an audio recording and transcription of father's blessings. patriarch his scribe makes an audio recording of the blessing. Other ordinances and blessings should not be recorded ordinances, see [38.2.3](/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number23-p2735#title_number23). 38.2.3 Streaming Ordinances When possible, those ordinance should strive to attend in person. When members gather for an ordinance, they feel the influence of the Spirit and fellowship with one another. However, when a close family member is not able to attend in person, the bishop or stake president may authorize streaming the ordinance to him or her.

Individuals whose disabilities make them not kingdom of heaven\" ( [Doctrine and Covenants 137:10](/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/137.10?lang=eng#p10)). For this reason, ordinances are not needed or performed for them. The only exception is sealing to parents for those who were not born in the covenant. For information about performing ordinances for those Ordinances and Blessings Performed by and for Those Who Have Physical Disabilities Persons who have physical disabilities, such as the resolve, president contacts the Office of the First Presidency. Persons who are deaf or hard of hearing may communicate through sign language to or ratify the ordinance. In some cases, an ordinance must be performed again. When this happens, a clerk records the new date on the membership record, even if it is out of sequence with the dates of other ordinances. 38.2.6.1 A Membership Record Was Not Created or the Year Is Missing or Incorrect For record-keeping purposes, an ordinance is considered not valid if the year it was performed is missing or incorrect on the membership record. In addition, a baptism is not valid if a membership record was not created. The ordinance can be validated with the original certificate that was issued when the ordinance was performed. With this certificate, the bishop can authorize a clerk to update the membership record. If the certificate cannot be found, the ordinance can be validated with the testimony of two people who witnessed it. The two witnesses should: - Have been 8 years old or older when the ordinance was performed. - Have seen or heard the ordinance. - Be Church members of record at the time they give their testimony. - Give their testimony in writing, stating either (1) the complete date the ordinance was performed or (2) the year it was performed and the person who performed it. - Sign their testimony in the presence of a member of the bishopric or stake presidency. With this testimony, the bishop can authorize a clerk to create or update the membership record. The written testimony may then be discarded. If the certificate or witnesses cannot be found, the ordinance must be performed again. If the member has received other ordinances after the invalid ordinance, they must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. 38.2.6.2 Ordinances Were Received out of Sequence An ordinance is not valid if a person received it out of sequence. For example, a man's endowment is not valid To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. 38.2.6.3 The Ordinance Was Performed before the Appropriate Age An ordinance is not valid if it was performed before the appropriate age. For example, a baptism is not valid if it was performed before the person was 8 years old. If no other ordinances were received after the invalid ordinance, it should be performed again. other ordinances received, those and the invalid ordinance must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. 38.2.6.4 The Ordinance Was Performed without the Proper Authority An ordinance is not valid if it was performed by someone who did not have the proper priesthood authority. For example, a confirmation is not valid if it was performed by someone who did not hold the Melchizedek Priesthood. Similarly, it is not it received the Melchizedek proper (see see also [32.17](/study/manual/general-handbook/32-repentance-and-membership-councils?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number93-p443#title_number93)). ordinance, it should be performed again by someone with the proper authority. If other ordinances were received, those and the invalid ordinance must be ratified by the First Presidency. To request this, the stake president sends a letter to the Office of the First Presidency. In some cases, the First Presidency may instruct that ordinances be performed again. 38.2.7 Naming Blessing Children For naming blessing children, see [18.6](/study/manual/general-handbook/18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number8-p43#title_number8). 38.2.7.1 Babies Who Are holder may perform the naming and blessing in the hospital or at home.

Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the blessing. 38.2.7.3 Children Whose Sometimes a child's parents or guardians request that the child be blessed even though they are not members of the Church. When this happens, the bishop obtains verbal permission from the parents or guardians. Permission is not required from a parent or guardian who has no legal basis for opposing the blessing. The bishop explains that: - A membership record will be created for the child. - Ward members will contact them periodically. - He or other ward leaders will propose that the child prepare to be baptized as he or she approaches age 8. 38.2.8 Baptism and Confirmation For general information about baptism [18.8](/study/manual/general-handbook/18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number23-p106#title_number23). disability may be baptized and confirmed if he or she can reasonably be considered accountable.

The person, his or her parents or guardians (where applicable), and the bishop counsel together determine whether the person should be baptized and confirmed. If the person is a potential convert, the mission president holds the keys for his or her baptism (see [18.7.1.2](/study/manual/general-handbook/18-priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number15-p54#title_number15)). In this case, the missionaries inform the mission president. He counsels with the person and his or her parents or guardians (where applicable) to determine whether he or she should be baptized and confirmed. If the bishop knows the person well, the mission president may also seek his input. Those who are not accountable do not need to be baptized, regardless of age (see [Doctrine and Covenants 29:46-50](/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29.46-50?lang=eng#p46) and [38.2.4](/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number38-p2743#title_number38) in this handbook). For information about the membership records of persons who may not be accountable, see [33.6.10](/study/manual/general-handbook/33-records-and-reports?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number29-p129#title_number29). 38.2.8.2 Minors A minor, as defined by local laws, may be baptized when both of the following conditions are met: - The parents or legal permission.

However, the child's legal name, as defined by local law or custom, should be recorded on the membership record and 38.2.8.3 Persons Are Married A married person must have the consent of his or her spouse before being baptized. 38.2.8.4 Persons Who Are Cohabiting A couple living together but not married must commit to living the law of chastity before either of them can be baptized. This includes exercising faith unto repentance as described in [Doctrine and Covenants 20:37](/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.37?lang=eng#p37). It also includes no longer living together or, in the case of a man and a woman, getting married. 38.2.8.5 Persons Whose may considered 38.2.8.6 Situations the Mission President or First Presidency Authorization from the mission president is required before a person can be baptized if he or she has ever: In these cases, the mission president interviews the person. If necessary, the mission president may authorize one of his counselors to conduct who conducts it reports to the mission president, who may then authorize or deny the baptism and confirmation.

The same is true for a person who has confessed to committing murder even if the confession was in private to a priesthood leader. As used here, murder does not include abortion or police or military action in the line of duty. If the person is seeking baptism for the first time, the mission president follows the instructions in [38.2.8.6](/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number267-p2794#title_number267).

He may be ordained an elder when he has developed sufficient understanding of the gospel and demonstrated his worthiness. The bishop and stake president interview him to make this determination (see [31.2.6](/study/manual/general-handbook/31?lang=eng\u00b6=title_number18-p191#title_number18)). more Wards the Past Year Sometimes a brother who has lived in a ward for less than one year needs or desires to be ordained to a Melchizedek Priesthood office.

The Church's position is that abuse cannot be tolerated in any form. Those who abuse their spouses, children, other family members, or anyone else violate the laws of God and man. All members, especially parents and leaders, are encouraged to be alert and diligent and do all they can to protect children and others against abuse. If members become aware of instances of abuse, they report it to civil authorities and counsel with the bishop. Church leaders should take reports of abuse seriously and never disregard them. All adults who work with children or youth are to complete children and youth protection training within one month of being sustained (see [ProtectingChildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org](http://protectingchildren.churchofjesuschrist.org)). They are to repeat the training every three years. When abuse occurs, the first and immediate responsibility of Church leaders is to help those who have been abused and to protect vulnerable persons from future abuse. Leaders should not encourage a person to remain in or situation that is abusive or unsafe. 38.6.2.1 Abuse Help Line In some countries, the Church has established a confidential abuse help line to assist stake presidents and bishops. These leaders should promptly call the help line about every situation in which a person may have been abused\u2014or is at risk of being abused. They should also call it if they become aware of a member viewing, purchasing, or distributing child pornography. The help line is available for bishops and stake presidents to call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Phone numbers are shown below. - United States and - United Kingdom: - Ireland: 1800 937 546 0805 710 531 - Australia: 02 9841 5454 (from within the country) - New Zealand: 09 488 5592 (from within the country) Bishops and stake presidents should call the help line when addressing situations involving any type of abuse.

Laws differ by location, and most Church leaders are not legal experts. Calling the help line is essential for bishops and stake presidents to fulfill their responsibilities report abuse. A bishop should also notify his stake president of instances of abuse. In countries that do not have a help line, a bishop who learns of abuse should contact his stake president. The stake president should seek guidance from the area legal counsel at the area office. He is also encouraged to counsel with the Family Services staff or the welfare and self-reliance manager at the area office. 38.6.2.2 Counseling in Cases of Abuse Victims of abuse often suffer serious trauma. Stake presidents compassion and the effects of shame or guilt. Victims are not guilty of sin. Leaders help them and their families understand God's love and the healing that comes through His Atonement abuse to repent and to cease their abusive behavior. If an adult has committed a sexual sin against a child, the behavior may be very difficult to change.
