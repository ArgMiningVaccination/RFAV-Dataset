It has demonstrated good stability over time without losing its quality required as a product for up to two years. But stability studies have shown that the useful shelf-life of this product could be extended to three years. Therefore, this work was aimed to evaluate the possible toxic potential of VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae, at a controlled temperature of 4 to 8 \u00b0 C for 24 and 36 months were administered to animals. The experimental design included the daily observa - tion of animals, the assessment of water and food consumption, thermometry, muscle volume during differences of toxicological interest were found among the experimental groups in terms of body weight, water and food consumption. No le sions of diagnostic value were aluminum hydroxide. These results indicated that the shelf-life of the VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine can be extended from 24 to 36 months, due to the lack of local adverse or systemic toxic effects in the assayed dose, Sprague Dawley rats Biotecnolog\u00eda Aplicada 2018;35:1501-1503 RESUMEN Toxicidad por dosis \u00fanica de la vacuna antimeningoc\u00f3ccica VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae en ratas Sprague Dawley para extender su vida \u00fatil en anaquel hasta 36 meses. VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae es una vacuna segura y eficaz en la prevenci\u00f3n de la meningitis meningoc\u00f3ccica causada por los serogrupos B y C. La misma ha demostrado buena estabilidad en el tiempo sin perder su calidad exigida como producto, al ser almacenada en anaquel hasta dos a\u00f1os. Sin embargo, estudios de estabilidad han mostrado que el tiempo de vida \u00fatil pudiera ser extendido hasta tres a\u00f1os. Con este prop\u00f3sito, se evalu\u00f3 el posible potencial t\u00f3xico del producto en un estudio de dosis \u00fanica en ratas Sprague Dawley. Se emple\u00f3 lotes de VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae mantenidos en temperatura controlada de 4 a 8 \u00baC durante 24 y 36 meses. El dise\u00f1o experimental contempl\u00f3 la observaci\u00f3n diaria de los animales, las evaluaciones del consumo de agua y alimento, termometr\u00eda, volumen muscular y peso corporal. Los animales fueron sometidos a necropsia para estudios anatomopatol\u00f3gicos, en busca de posibles efectos adversos tras la inmunizaci\u00f3n. No se observaron s\u00edntomas de toxicidad ni muertes durante el estudio. Tampoco se encontraron diferencias de inter\u00e9s toxicol\u00f3gico entre los grupos experimentales en cuanto al peso corporal, el consumo de agua y de alimentos. En los an\u00e1lisis anatomopatol\u00f3gicos, se observaron procesos granulomatosos de tipo macrof\u00e1gicos, los que son caracter\u00edsticos de las vacunas adyuvadas con hidr\u00f3xido de aluminio. Estos resultados indicaron que la vida \u00fatil de la vacuna VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae almacenada en anaquel pudiera ser extendida de 24 a 36 meses, ya que no se evidenciaron efectos adversos locales ni sist\u00e9micos de tipo t\u00f3xico en los animales vacunados. Palabras clave: toxicidad vacunal, VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae, vacunaci\u00f3n, dosis the causative agent of me ningococal meningitis in children [1]. This is a Gram- negative bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract asymptomatically, with five main disease-causing se - rogroups: A, C, Y , W135, and B [1]. The incidence and geographic distribution of the disease and the causative serogroups constantly change, with socalled 'meningitis belt' in Africa, with several countries in Asia and South America where there is a significant incidence of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has alerted on the latent risk for major epidemics in some of those countries [2-4]. In this setting, vaccination has been used to and to vaccines available is V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae [5], registered by the Finlay Institute for the effective immunization against 1.

Materials and methods Experimental and The designed following the recommenda - tions and guidelines issued and weighing 198-210 g were used, as supplied by the National Center for the Produc - tion of Laboratory Animals (CENPALAB, Cuba) ac - companied by their certificates of sanitary quality and zootechnics. The relevance Treatment groups, route of administration and dose Three experimental groups of 10 animals of both sexes each were assayed. A control group received phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) as placebo and the other two groups were vaccinated with a single dose of V A-MEN - GOC-BC\u00ae stored at 4 to 8 \u00b0C for 36 months (Lots (i.m.) to each animal, in a total volume of 0.2 mL (0.1 mL on each leg) [10], on the posterior middle region of the inner side of each thigh. The dose was established by extrapolating the al - lometric and weight proportions between men and the animal model used as equivalent to the vaccine dosage administered in humans guaranteeing a safety margin. The 0.2 mL volume was the maximum specified for the species by i.m. route [11]. Animals were vaccinated and single daily determinations were made in the follow - ing 14 days attending to: animal weight, water and food consumption and body temperature. Muscle volume in - crease at the inoculation site was also measured during the first 72 h. Animals were euthanized on day 14 for anatomopathological studies, to seek for any possible variation in the normal physiology of organs, to Housing conditions Animals were area: 1800 cm2) (Tecniplast, Italy), distributed in five animals of the same sex per box and they were individually identified by ear steril - ized in autoclave for 25 min at 121 \u00b0C and changed twice a week. Animals were provided with special - ized rat feed (ALYco\u00ae; supplied under con trolled conditions at 22 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, relative humidity of 60 \u00b1 5 % and a light/dark of 12/12 h. Observations, clinical symptoms and body weight The animals were observed every 12 h since vaccine ad - ministration. The inoculation site was closely inspect - ed, and special attention any other symptom. The animals were weighed just before the inocu - lation and subsequently at weekly intervals (7 and 14 days post-inoculation). Data was recorded individua - lly, together with data regarding the group, sex and treatments received. Water and food consumption These parameters were evaluated at the start of the study and every two days. Water consumption was measured per group of animals as the difference between the initial water volume placed in the box and the remaining volume at the time of collection. An initial volume of 750 mL of water was provided per box, measured with a 1000-mL graduated glass cylinder (Thomas Scientific, USA). Mean daily con - sumption per animal was calculated dividing the difference of water volume between the number of animals in the box and the period from the previous data collection. Similarly, mean daily food consumption per animal was calculated, providing 500 g of ALYco\u00ae rat feed per box and measuring the different after the estab - lished period. The remaining feed was weighed with a Body temperature was measured intra-rectally for 1 to 2 min with the aid of a clinical mercury thermometer according to standard procedures. Determinations were made on 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation and properly recorded. Muscle diameter was assessed with a display (MasterCraf, USA) by two trained technicians, one restraining the animal and the other making the measurement. Briefly, the middle region of reference, followed by external jaws and outer faces of the biceps femoral muscle. Then, the caliper was fitted without pressure and readings were made. Measures were taken and recorded 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. Experimental endpoint euthanasia and ethics Animals were euthanized by 100 thiopental per kg of body weight by i.v. route 3.

In both cases, consump - tion was higher in females from the group the lot 0021. However, these differences were irrel - evant from the physiological and toxicological points of view, due to the similarity of weight gain among all the groups and the absence of clinical symptoms. At the same time, the differences seen in female animals im - munized with vaccine lot 0021 could be related with a mild fever detected on them at 8 h post-inoculation. Thermometry muscular diameter The physiological range of body temperature reported for the species 37.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00baC [20]. As shown in figure 2, during the first 8 h there was a slight increase in the mean body differences were found in fe - male rats between for the group receiving the vaccine (37.97 \u00baC) as compared to placebo (37.43 \u00baC). In that vaccine group, four out of ten animals had a mild fever (38.1-38.5 \u00baC), at 8 h post inoculation, which was transient and subsequently disappeared. This could be related to the increased water and food consumption seen in these animals from 8 to 24 h post-inoculation, to recover from the lower consumption rate experimented occurred. Moreover, these parameters were In fact, such effects are well documented in differences in respect to females of the other two groups. Temperature values at 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation were similar (p 0.05) within physiological ranges. During the experiment, all the experimental pain vaccine pain, vomiting and a given results obtained were re - garded as satisfactory, with no fever detected in vacci - ne animals after 8 h post-inoculation, and in agreement with all the other evaluations as evidencing the low re - actogenicity of the vaccine tested. They also extended the safety profile of the V A-MENGOC-BC\u00ae vaccine. Additionally, the assessment of muscular diameter helps to determine the occurrence of any inflammatory differences (p 0.05) in vaccinated animals as compared to the control group at 24 and 48 h, with no significant differences detected between vaccine groups (Table 2). Such an effect was as expected in vaccinated animals due to the alumi - num hydroxide present in the formulation as vaccine adjuvant, together with the effect of the progression to normal values from 48 h onwards. These was indicative and complemented the low re - actogenicity profile of the vaccine, together with the lack of They were in both groups (Table of been consistently reported in animals 38.038.5 37.5 37.0 24 Time (h post-inoculation)Control Lot 0021 Lot 9001-Y in Sprague Dawley rats immunized either with 0021 and 9001-Y value significant differences were by post inoculation (h)10.4 \u00b1 0.9 10.9 \u00b1 0.510.3 \u00b1 0.8 10.9 \u00b1 0.510.3 \u00b1 0.8 a 10.8 \u00b1 0.3 a10.3 \u00b1 0.8 a 10.8 \u00b1 0.3 a10.5 \u00b1 0.6 10.7 \u00b1 0.910.3 \u00b1 0.8 10.8 \u00b1 0.50 08 824 2448 4872 72Means\u00b6 Means\u00b610.0 \u00b1 0.6 10.6 \u00b1 0.610.7 \u00b1 0.4 10.8 \u00b1 0.511.8 \u00b1 0.9 b 11.8 \u00b1 0.6 b11.8 \u00b1 0.9 b 12.1 \u00b1 0.7 b11.2 \u00b1 0.7 10.9 \u00b1 0.711.1 \u00b1 0.7 11.2 \u00b1 0.610.6 \u00b1 0.5 10.3 \u00b1 0.810.8 \u00b1 0.3 10.5 \u00b1 0.411.7 \u00b1 1.0 b 11.8 \u00b1 0.4 b11.5 \u00b1 0.8 b 12.4 \u00b1 0.7 b10.9 \u00b1 0.7 11.1 \u00b1 0.211.1 \u00b1 0.6 11.2 \u00b1 0.510.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b1 0.60.7811 0.063310.6 \u00b1 0.5 0.50.4148 0.299911.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 0.40.0035 0.000211.2 \u00b1 0.8 11.8 \u00b1 0.60.0038 0.000210.8 \u00b1 0.6 10.9 \u00b1 0.60.2642 0.745110.8 \u00b1 0.7 11.1 \u00b1 0.5 - - * Each value represents the mean of the diameter respectively. and sex; Mean = 10) inoculated with either VA-MENGOC-BC\u00ae or PBS (control group) during the vaccine toxicity* Groups Control Lot 9001-YLot 0021 Total0 a 0 a 0 0 0 0 0 a 0 aFemales Inflammatory processesInflammatory processesAdenitis Adenitis % % % %Males 7 b 10 b 70.0 100 10.0 10.0 1 a 1 a 7 b 10 b 70.0 100 10.0 10.0 1 a 1 a 14 20 46.6 66.6 06.6 06.6 2 AA, editors.
