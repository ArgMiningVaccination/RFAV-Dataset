Find out: Are cannabis, hemp and marijuana the same thing? What are THC and CBD? Are the medicinal benefits of cannabis true? What are the health risks? And as of now, is there enough data to assess the mortality impact? Hemp and and very little Its are for paper, rope, fabrics insulation) and potentially medicinal/therapeutic. In this report, \"marijuana\" refers to a cannabis product (the plant in its natural state or processed and consumed in varying forms in the United States (US) and Canada since the 1600s. In 1619, Virginia required that hemp be grown on every farm and it was even used as currency in several colonies. Smoking marijuana was not uncommon in the 1800s. Over time, perceptions about its use and risk changed. The 1923 Canadian Narcotics Drug Act Amendment Bill and the 1937 US Marihuana [sic] Tax Act outlawed all cannabis consumption and forms. In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act banned cannabis of any kind in the US, and made it a Schedule 1 drug (no useful medical recreational cannabis nationwide in 2018. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) regulates the import, export and grading of cannabis seed. The 2018 US Farm Bill legalized the growing and possession of all 50 states, unless a state specifically outlaws its use. Hemp is now considered to be an agricultural product. In contrast, marijuana remains illegal under US federal law. Since 1996, however, all but three US states and one US territory2 have legalized cannabis for medical Cannabis was used by worldwide, 4% of the in 2014; \"no risk\" increased from 6% to 15%3. A 2018 CDC report of 26,900 working adults in Colorado found that, during in persons aged 18-25 years (29.6%) and lowest in was higher among men (17.2%) than women (11.3%). A 2018 study into 2016 prior-year use, found that cannabis was used by approximately 192 million people worldwide, 4% of the world's population5. Dried marijuana includes the flower and leaf of the marijuana plant. This form is most commonly smoked, be consumed orally. Concentrates products made via a variety extraction processes that separate the THC and CBD cannabinoids from Some concentrates THC, others contain mostly or all Hash is by using water and compression to extract THC the marijuana plant into a Rosin uses heat, oil the THC. THC-CO2 solvents. food and plant as described above THC and marijuana, be or via topical and Canada agency products; Canada is responsible for accessing and monitoring the quality, safety efficacy all drugs and products that contain marijuana or hemp. The US Federal Drug Agency (FDA) is not yet involved in the regulation of cannabis content or efficacy, and states which have legalized medical or recreational marijuana do not have the resources to provide these consumer protections. The FDA recently announced that it will intervene to prevent claims of medical efficacy unless there is support such claims. on the label.\" Due to the lack of uniform standards and testing, there remains significant variance in THC CBD concentrations in different products, as inconsistency within single product lines. One study6 reported that 70% of CBD amount on the label (40% had less than on the product label, while 26% contained too much). The study also found that is absorbed orally. THC and CBD have been proven to be effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy7. There is evidence which supports their use in adults with chronic pain, and in reducing spasticity in multiple though effects are the CFIA has sclerosis-related spasticity. There are products in US.

Note, evidence remains inconsistent; there is currently inadequate data and research to assess full indications7. as a Schedule 1 drug in 1970, research in the US has been limited. Even in states that have legalized recreational cannabis, research institutions face federal legal actions and loss of federal research funding if marijuana is provided for and other confounding variables are not noted or analyzed. The 2018 US Farm Bill removed hemp the Schedule 1 CBD without the previous The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) recently recognized the lack of quality data, stating that \"Given the uncertainties of cannabis use on health, CMHA hopes to see greater investments in research to establish more conclusive evidence on the harms and benefits of cannabis consumption over the life course and its impact on mental health for Canadians\"17. An extensive review and critical analysis of the available literature by the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 20177currently provides the best overview of the health risks associated with cannabis. The NIH concluded that marijuana can impair attention, concentration, episodic causative role in chronic diseases. does to increase in a dose dependent fashion18. Heavy cannabis users are more likely of suicide than are non-users7. THC risk of developing psychoses or schizophrenia.\" The NIH found that smoking cannabis is associated with chronic cough and phlegm production. This can cause microscopic lung and airway changes similar to those seen in tobacco smoking19; there are no additive effects from smoking both cannabis and tobacco7. Cannabis smoking cessation is associated with the resolution of these bronchitis symptoms. Data is not clear with lung cancer or with head and neck cancer7. A large study (involving data from several countries) found that self-reported marijuana use is associated with a 20-30% increase in the rate of motor vehicle crashes20. In Canada, where medical marijuana been legal since cannabis-associated involved almost 7,800 people and 75 In four US states that legalized marijuana between 2012 to 2017 - Nevada, Colorado, Washington and Oregon - car crashes rose by 6%22. However, to date there is no clear link between THC blood levels and impairment23 [. Testing drivers for THC is inconsistent and was rarely, if ever, done before 2012. Even today, if a driver tests positive for alcohol consumption, THC testing is not usually done22, presumably due to the additional costs and lack of established legal limits.] The less than use. The found the safety profile of Epidiolex\u00ae to be acceptable. Since CBD has no intoxicating effects, is these contaminants is currently unknown. The majority of the medical literature that addresses the associated mortality of cannabis is unreliable due to small size, short periods of study, selection bias, and a lack of control regarding co-morbid conditions. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) and NIH reviewed published data. agencies. the NIH concluded there is no increase in all-cause mortality associated with cannabis use7, 24. Both the IOM and NIH concluded there is no increase in all-cause mortality associated with cannabis use.\" A similar exercise for CBD-specific literature has not been completed. There is no rationale or evidence that CBD has increased mortality implications as compared to cannabis use, which at present shows no increase. As such, it appears reasonable to assume that no proof of increased mortality associated with CBD. have related findings or opinions We to hearing from you.
