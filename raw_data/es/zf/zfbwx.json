III. The examining division refused the application because it considered that the subject-matter of the eight claims of the sole request before it lacked novelty (Article 54 EPC) and that the disclosure of the invention was insufficient (Article 83 EPC). IV. The reasons given by the examining division in its written decision for its finding of lack of sufficiency of disclosure can be summarized as follows: The dilutions C12 or dilution statistically not contain a molecule of not sufficiently disclosed and, as a consequence, nor was the claimed treatment. The therapeutic efficacy of a medicament which did not contain any active ingredient was doubtful. For a medical treatment to be considered as sufficiently disclosed experimental evidence had to be linked to an active examples disclosed the application did not include a placebo reference. Therefore, no effect over a placebo control was demonstrated and, consequently, the medical treatment was based on a placebo effect. This failure to demonstrate a reproducible therapeutic effect of an active why the claimed subject-matter contravened the requirements of Article 83 effect shown it could not be taken into account in order to overcome a lack of disclosure in the application since sufficiency of disclosure must be satisfied at the effective date of the patent application. V. With the statement the grounds of appeal the applicants (hereinafter \"appellants\") filed a VI. Moreover, documents D9 and D10 of appeal. Document D11 was submitted with the appellants' letter of 21 January 2013 in order to show \"that the claimed concept actually works\". VII. opinion in a communication, namely (i) that the of the main and auxiliary request contravened the requirements of Article because the feature or features imparted to the product by the process by which it was defined were not known, it was also not known by which feature or features the product could be distinguished from known products, and that therefore the claimed subject-matter did the clarity-requirement of Article 84 EPC and finally (iii) that the examples in the application were not appropriate to make the treatment according to the claimed second medical use plausible so that the requirements of Article 83 EPC were also not fulfilled. VIII. A further (second) was in response to the board's communication. only C-terminal angiotensin receptor for use in treating hypertension.\" IX. Oral proceedings were held on 20 February 2013. The appellants withdrew their main request and first auxiliary request and made the second auxiliary request their new main request. X. The appellants arguments, insofar they are relevant for the present decision, be summarized as follows: Article 83 EPC The claimed treatment did rely on homeopathic concepts of individual prescription and curing similar with similar, but was based on antibodies, a substance never used in homeopathy, and grounded on conclusive medicine principles. The pharmaceutical preparation used in the treatment according to claim 1 was beyond the Avogadro limit. multiple consecutive dilution according to homeopathic technology the of the original substance was \"released\" to the diluent so that after the dilutions the diluent had properties which the undiluted diluent did not possess. The way which the diluent stored and transmitted information needed further study, but it was not contrary to well-established physical laws. The data of Example 4 from the treatment of a human being diagnosed with \"essential hypertension with primary clearly the effect. Thus, the medicament had an activity and therefore it was not correct to say that the preparation did not contain any active ingredient. The relevant question in the context of Article 83 EPC and claims to a second medical use was, whether or not the skilled person was enabled to disease was required that the effect achieved by a medical preparation had to be based on a tangible molecule, nor that the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect be understood, nor that the data provided in support of the treatment were statistically relevant, in particular not if the scope of the claim was as narrow as it was here. Therefore, saying that the data of Example 4 did not make it plausible that the composition referred to in the claim could be used for the treatment of hypertension without any further substantiation as to why, saying \"I do not believe them\". Thus, data in the application demonstrated that the mixture referred to in the claim had a therapeutic such an The that the decision under set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request. Reasons for the decision Main request 1. In view of its decision on Article 83 EPC the board has not deemed it necessary to take a decision on whether 123(2) Article 83 EPC 2. The only claim of the main request is a claim for a so-called second medical use and C-terminal receptor for use in treating hypertension.\" 2.1 According dilution \"C\" means that one part of a \"mother\" solution of a substance - here: a solution of rabbit antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the angiotensin II receptor - is added to ninety-nine parts of a diluent, i.e. normally water or alcohol, and subsequently vigorously shaken. One part of this diluted diluted in ninety-nine parts of and dilution twelve dilution are According to homeopathic theory the higher the dilution a stronger effect. a C200 dilution of comprises of 2.3 homeopathic are C12 and higher not a single molecule of the substance of the \"mother\" solution. It was confirmed by the appellants at the oral proceedings that this also applies to the three dilutions of the mixture referred in the claim, a 2.4 to homeopathic the absence of a tangible molecule does not mean that the diluted solution to the Also the submitted that due to a \"release\" of the activity of the original substance to the diluent during the multiple dilutions, the diluent the dilutions in claim 1 has properties which diluent does not have. The appellants contended also that the way in which the diluent stores and transmits the \"information\" is not known. 2.5 For the sake of the argument the board accepts in favour of the appellants that the mixture referred to in claim 1 contains active of unknown nature. Treatments according to homeopathic particular in a healthy substance, yet given as a homeopathic dilution, can cure these very same symptoms in a sick individual. This approach is different from that relied on for treatments according to \"conventional\" (allopathic) medicine. 3.1 In the present case the substance in the solution to be diluted according to homeopathic technology is \"antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the angiotensin II receptor\". 3.2 It is generally known that the angiotensin receptor II and in particular its C-terminal fragment can block the activation of angiotensin II receptor-binding antibodies have been suggested in the of \"conventional\" medical treatments as agents for the reduction of blood pressure, i.e. for the treatment of hypertension (see document D3, page 475, in particular the second paragraph). 3.3 Since the \"undiluted\" antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the angiotensin II receptor lower the blood pressure, the mixture referred to in claim 1, were it to be applied in accordance with This is also admitted by the appellants who state that the treatment is \"grounded on conclusive medicine principles\". 4. Hence, in the light of the observations in points 2 to 3.3 the board considers that the claimed invention would be perceived as \"unusual\" (i) from a conventional medical practitioner's point of view because the mixture defined in claim 1 does not achieve the therapeutic effect on the basis of a tangible but on the basis of an unknown \"active principle\" and (ii) also from homeopath's because, although being a mixture of dilutions, it in combines concepts of homeopathic and conventional medicine. There is no document in these proceedings published before the priority date of the application disclosing a treatment relying on this \"chimeric\" approach. 5. a in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. As established by the case law of the Boards of Appeal an invention is considered to be sufficiently disclosed in accordance with the provisions of Article 83 EPC, if the disclosure allows it to be performed without undue burden (Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 6th edition 2010, II.A.4.2). This has been interpreted by the case law in relation to claims to a second medical use to mean that the skilled person must not only be able to produce the compounds referred to in the claim but that it must also be put in a position by the disclosure in the application in combination with, or by, the common general knowledge to achieve the claimed treatment, i.e. the therapeutical effect, in a reliable and reproducible manner (Case Law Boards of II.A.4.2, 7th paragraph). 6. Convention does not lay down the prerequisites which the disclosure in an application must satisfy to fulfil the requirements of Article 83 EPC. the Boards of Appeal have repeatedly held, whether or not the disclosure is sufficient, is a matter to be decided on the circumstances of each individual case. Ultimately, the disclosure must be such that in its light the examining division or - as the case may be - the board is satisfied that the skilled person can carry out the claimed invention without undue burden (see Case Law of the Boards of Appeal, 6th edition 2010, II.A.5.1.1, 4th and 7. Therefore, since in relation to a claim to a second medical use it is required that the disclosure puts the skilled person in the position to effect a reliable and reproducible point 5 above), it follows from the observations in point 6 above that - unless this is not already derivable from the prior art - the application must provide suitable evidence in this respect. To this end, any kind of experimental data have been accepted by the Boards. It has also been repeatedly emphasized that \"it is composition reported\" (see for example decision T 609/02, point 9 of the Reasons). 8. As observed above in point 4, in the present case the \"chimeric\" approach disclosed in the present application was not part of the common general knowledge at the priority date of the application. Therefore, whether or not the skilled person is in a position to achieve the claimed treatment of hypertension in a reliable and reproducible manner has to be judged on the disclosure in the application alone. Since the description contains nothing which would allow the skilled person examples are particularly relevant. 9. Examples 1 to 3, 4 to 6 and 8 relate to the treatment of hypertension: 9.1 Examples 1 to 3 disclose experiments arterial hypertension\". Example 1 discloses the results of an experiment with 10 animals to which polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the receptor in a of homeopathic discloses the results an with 10 rats to which monoclonal antibodies to angiotensin II D6 + C12 + to 6 and 8 each disclose the results of the treatment of one human being suffering from hypertension for different reasons. To them - polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the receptor in a of antibodies necrosis factor alpha dilutions C12 + C30 + C200 and antibodies against tumour necrosis factor alpha receptor in a mixture of homeopathic dilutions D12 + LM10) (Example 8), respectively, was or were administered. 10. In 2 and 3 mixtures of homeopathic dilutions of compounds are tested of polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of the human angiotensin II receptor. In Examples 5, 6 and 8 combinations of mixtures are used, some of which do not even include the mixture to claim 1 and they are consequently not relevant with regard to the present issue. Thus, only Examples 1 and 4 are relevant. 11. Example 1 discloses a study with rats. The is summarized as follows: \"The data with a 10-year history of essential hypertension. On dilutions C12 + C30 + C200), 1 tablet BID. The blood pressure stabilized at 130-135 / 85 mm Hg within 7 days of the start of treatment. After 2 months of treatment, electrocardiography revealed a decrease left ventricle.\" 11.1 The board notes that neither of these two Examples 1 and 4 includes tests where substances serving as negative controls are applied. for example, to indicate the initial blood pressure or which measures had been taken to exclude that the hypotensive effect could be due to other reasons, for example other treatments, intake of particular food, increased sport activity, etc. 12. The board has serious doubts that the claimed treatment of hypertension can be reliably reproducibly achieved by the to in reasons summarized in point 4 above, namely, (i) because on the standards of \"conventional\" medicine and science it is unconceivable that a homeopathic medicament which effects and (ii) on the homeopathic medicine it is unconceivable that a homeopathic (see point 11.1 above) and quantity (see points 9.1 and 9.2 above) of the relevant evidence in the application, i.e. Examples 1 and 4, the board comes to the conclusion that the level of evidence is not sufficient to satisfy it that the cannot come to the conclusion that the disclosure in the application - and this is the only source of information in the present case (see point 4 above) - puts the skilled person in the position to achieve the hypertension in a reliable and reproducible manner. Hence, the disclosure of the invention in the application is considered to be insufficient. 12.1 The board observes that the reason for this conclusion is not, as suggested by the appellants' submission and of available evidence which is considered to be inappropriate in the light of the character of the present invention. 13. The present board's conclusion is in harmony with rulings of Boards of Appeal in a number of cases which it considers to be similar to the present case insofar as in those cases also the boards had serious doubts that the skilled person could achieve the suggested effect of the claimed invention on the basis of the disclosure in the application or the common general knowledge because, for example, the invention was conceptually new, went opinion established theories, was in an unexplored field or appeared to go against natural laws and therefore have called for a particularly conclusive disclosure of the invention (see for example decisions T 541/96, points 5 to 8 of the Reasons; T 442/97, points 3.2, 3.14 and 3.15 of the Reasons; T 792/00, points 3, 4, 7 and 11 of the Reasons; T 397/02, points 12, 16 and 18, ; T 1111/02, points 8 and 12 of the Reasons; T 58/05, points 2.3 and 2.4 of the Reasons; T 1785/06, points 3.4.1 to 3.4.3 of the Reasons; T 1842/06, points 3.1 to 5.4.4 of the Reasons; T 1329/07, points 2.2.1 to 2.2.5 of the Reasons; T 491/08, points 6 to 12 of the Reasons; T 2281/09, points 2.1, 2.4, 2.8 and 2.9; T 1685/10, points 3.1 to 3.8 of the Reasons). 14. Sufficiency of disclosure must be satisfied at the effective date of the patent, i.e. on the basis of the information in the patent application together with, or on the basis of, the common general knowledge then available to the skilled person. Therefore, the disclosure in post-published can taken into account for the question of sufficiency of disclosure if it was used to back up the positive findings in relation to the disclosure in a patent application (see for example decision T 609/02, point 8 of the Reasons). Thus, in view of the board's conclusion can therefore be into account here. 15. The application does not fulfil the requirements of Article 83 EPC. Order ORDER For these reasons "}
