Mortality in ICU was patients who were 75 years of age. No differences in duration of MV, prevalence of tracheostomy or reintubation incidence were found. Regarding the indication for MV, only the patient who was 75 years of age with pneumonia, sepsis or trauma mortality were at the expense of pneumonia, sepsis and trauma. Analizar el pron\u00f3stico de los pacientes ancianos ventilados mec\u00e1nicamente en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos (UCI).Dise\u00f1o y \u00e1mbito An\u00e1lisis secundario de un estudio observacional prospectivo y multic\u00e9ntrico llevado a cabo durante un periodo de 2 a\u00f1os en 13 UCI espa\u00f1olas.Pacientes Pacientes adultos que precisaron ventilaci\u00f3n mec\u00e1nica (VM) invasiva durante m\u00e1s de 24 horas.Intervenciones Ninguna.Variables de inter\u00e9s Datos demogr\u00e1ficos, APACHE II, SOFA, motivo de VM, comorbilidad, situaci\u00f3n funcional, reintubaci\u00f3n, duraci\u00f3n de la VM, traqueotom\u00eda, mortalidad en la UCI, mortalidad hospitalaria.Resultados Se incluyeron 1.661 pacientes. De ellos 1.127 pacientes (25,4%) ten\u00edan 75 a\u00f1os o m\u00e1s. Los \u00edndices de comorbilidad y capacidad funcional fueron peor en este grupo de pacientes (p<0,001 para ambas variables). La mortalidad en la UCI fue superior en este grupo (33,6%) que en los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes (25,9%) (p=0,002), al igual que la mortalidad hospitalaria (41,8 vs 31,8%; p<0,0001). No hubo diferencias en cuanto a tiempo de VM, incidencia de traqueotom\u00edas o \u00edndice de reintubaciones. Por causas de VM solo los pacientes 75 a\u00f1os ventilados por neumon\u00eda, sepsis o trauma presentaron una mortalidad en UCI m\u00e1s alta que los menores de esa edad (46,3 vs 33,1% p=0,006; 55 vs p<0,001 respectivamente).Conclusiones Los ancianos ( 75 a\u00f1os) tienen una mayor mortalidad en UCI y hospitalaria que los m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes sin diferencias en la duraci\u00f3n de la VM. Las diferencias son a expensas de patolog\u00edas como neumon\u00eda, sepsis y trauma. Old age is associated with a high prevalence of chronic disease and functional deterioration. Elderly people are considered not only to have a limited life expectancy but also poor quality of life. As a result, a priori they are regarded as patients with a poor prognosis, [1-4](#bib0005) and there is a tendency to reject their admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), fundamentally when the pathology leading makes them invasive However, 1990s, 12.5% of the patients in Spanish ICUs were over 75 years of age, and 41% were between 60 and 75 years of age. [5](#bib0025) In this context, the hospital admission rate exponentially the reach 84.3 years in men and 89.9 years in women by the year 2048-this representing an increase since 2007 of 6.5 and 5.8 years, respectively. The simulation made reflects the progressive aging of our demographic structure, as it is clearly seen in the evolution the Spanish population (and also will make it according to the simulation made by the National Institute of Statistics (INE). [6](#bib0030) The present study compares the prognosis of elderly patients (75 years) with the individuals a cohort of critical patients subjected to mechanical ventilation.Methods A secondary was made of a prospective, multicenter observational study carried out over a period of two years in 13 Spanish polyvalent ICUs. A retrospective analysis was made of the adults subjected to mechanical ventilation for over 24h and included age as were patients in which limitation of been considered influencing the results obtained, and critical burn cases. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the healthcare area of the coordinating center (Hospital Virgen de la Luz, Cuenca, Spain). Due to the nature of the study (observational, anonymous and with no intervention), ICU and hospital mortality. The indications of mechanical ventilation were recorded based on the criteria the severity of the background disease, old age, or high risk of the surgical procedure.| |1.b.

In turn, the comparison of qualitative variables was carried out using the chi-squared test or the Fisher exact test, as applicable. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05.Results Four of the participating centers were university hospitals, and 12 had accreditation for postgraduate training in Intensive Care Medicine. The mean number of beds was (range 250-1450), number of ICU beds was 15 (range 8-44). A total of 1661 patients were included. Of these, 67.9% (n=1127) were men, and the mean age was APACHE II score: 20.3\u00b17.5. SOFA the patients (25.4%, n=423) were 75 years of age. The age distribution is shown in [Fig. 2](#fig0010). The most was lower in the group of patients who were 75 years of age than in those of younger age (2.5\u00b11.8 vs 1.8\u00b12, p<0.001; and 90.1\u00b115.6 vs 93.4 14.3, p<0.001). There were no differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation, the incidence of reintubation (early or late), or in the incidence of tracheotomy between the two groups.

There has concern the the characteristics of the patients admitted to the ICU between the 1980s and 1990s, with a growth in the proportion of admitted patients over 70 years of age, which moreover were subjected to an increasing number of al., who identified a 13% increase in the admission of patients who were 80 years of age over a 6-year period in Australia and New Zealand. In the 1990s, different studies had evaluated the prognosis of poor results, though of these studies were limited by their retrospective design, small sample size, subjected to mechanical ventilation with ages over 65, [20-22](#bib0100) 70, [23-25](#bib0115) 80 [14,26,27](#bib0070) or 85 years [21,28](#bib0105) - a reported mortality rate of up to 68.1% among those over 85 years of age, 86% in the presence of two failed organs, and 100% in the presence of multiorgan failure (3 or more organs). [28](#bib0140) In Spain, two studies have addressed al. [29](#bib0145) have studied the prognosis of 313 patients 65 years of age admitted to the ICU. They had recorded a mortality rate of 30% in the ICU, 10% in hospital and 11% after discharge. The mortality rate after one year was 51%. Among the survivors, 58.6% were in good health and independent after one year of follow-up, 24.3% had some degree of disability, and 17% were dependent upon others for their activities of daily living. No distinction was made between ventilated and non-ventilated patients. Santana et al. [30](#bib0150) in turn retrospectively evaluated the prognosis of patients who were 70 years of age with a stay in the ICU of more than 30 days. All of them (n=42) were subjected to mechanical ventilation for an average of 37 days. The in-ICU mortality rate was 30%. According to the authors, the most important finding was that 60% were still alive one year after discharge. However, neither the results obtained firm drawn. Firstly, is difficult compare the results of studies, since they involved different age cutoff points, ranging from 65 to 85 years of age. Secondly, it is not easy to define such a cutoff point, and most the of retirement. However, in Spain, where the life expectancy at birth in the year 2010 was estimated to be 78.9 years in males and 84.9 years in females, it does not seem realistic to set the cutoff point for the elderly at age 65 years. [31,32](#bib0155) On the other hand, while some of the studies only analyze to be analyzed as an independent increased risk group. In turn, some of the studies only analyze in-hospital mortality, while others consider mortality at one year, and a few consider quality of life. At present, the variable \"mortality\" in absolute terms is life as the outcome variable. The growing care burden in the ICU, the uncertainty of the prognosis in elderly patients, the scarcity of in this population in ICUs, and the predicted change in the population pyramid of this country are issues that have led us to carry out this study. Its strength is the evaluation of the prognosis in a large series of elderly patients who are subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, the retrospective design and its consequences (lack of long-term follow-up agree authors [23](#bib0115) that at present age in itself should not be a factor limiting admission to the ICU and the indication of invasive The consequences of this situation, considering the demographic predictions of the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (INE), [6](#bib0030) are an exacerbation of the conflicts referred to distribution of the available resources. In effect, the question of how to and limited analyzed indicate comparatively increased hospital among elderly patients. The lack of follow-up does conclusions quality of life at hospital discharge in this population, with a view to adequately deal with the foreseeable demand in resources in the ICU over the coming years.Conflicts of interest The authors declare that JM, et al.
