El personal cientifico del IMARPE y el de su predecesor, el Instituto de Investigacidn de 10s Recursos Marinos (IREMAR), han estudiado la biologia, dinimica y habitat de la anchoveta, desde 10s inicios de 10s afios 50. Los conocimientos obtenidos a travCs de estas investigaciones y 10s informes emitidos, han ayudado a nuestro gobierno en la formulacidn de regulaciones para el manejo de la pesquena peligica durante esta turbulenta historia. A lo largo de su historia, IMARPE ha albergado proyectos cooperativos de investigacidn con instituciones extranjeras y ha acogido con beneplacito a cientificos del exterior. Ello ha robustecido nuestra productividad y ha coadyuvado a afianzar 10s contactos internacionales, sin lo cual hoy en dia, no podrian conducirse investigaciones sdlidas y profundas. En 10s aiios 80, nuestro principal colaborador del exterior ha sido el personal de la Deutsche Gesellschaft fiir Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), con sede en IMARPE del Proyecto Cooperativo Peruano-Alemin de Investigacidn Pesquera (PROCOPA). Ellos, y sus contrapartes peruanas, han producido desde 1982 a la fecha, alrededor de 90 contribuciones sobre diversos aspectos de 10s recursos del sistema peruano de afloramiento (ver Apdndice I1 de este libro). Estamos muy complacidos con esta alta produccidn. Este magnifico libro, que es el 4\" volumen publicado por PROCOPA y que contiene 11 contribuciones de PROCOPA, representa un adecuado broche final del proyecto mis productivo que IMARPE ha llevado a cab0 en 10s ultimos anos. Este libro, a1 mismo tiempo, inicia una nueva fase para nuestras investigaciones. Sobre la base de 10s datos y anilisis que este contiene, asi como aquellos incluidos en su volumen compaiiero publicado en 1987, harin posible finalmente, desarrollar el modelo de simulaci6n orientado a1 manejo de 10s recursos pesqueros del sistema peruano de afloramiento. El International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM), con ayuda de GTZ, nos apoyarin en esta tarea. A juzgar por el alto nivel alcanzado en la produccidn de este libro y el de su predecesor, y por la oportunidad en que se presentan, confiamos que este plan que produciri un modelo de simulacidn para el manejo de nuestra pesqueria peligica seri exitosamente implementado y esperamos con gran inter& su culminacidn. Deseo tomar esta oportunidad para expresar a nombre de IMARPE, nuestro agradecimiento a GTZ e ICLARM por el esfuerzo puesto de manifiesto en este libro; particularmente a1 Dr. Salzwedel, penhltimo jefe de PROCOPA, por su apoyo a1 taller de trabajo que condujo a la publicacidn de este libro; a1 Dr. P. Muck, 6ltimo jefe de PROCOPA, por nuestra fructifera cooperacidn; a Jaime Mendo e Isabel Tsukayama, por su aporte cientifico y editorial; a 10s participantes y observadores del taller de trabajo antes mencionado y habilmente presidido por J. Csirke de FAO. Deseo agradecer tambidn a 10s Drs. M. Bilio y W. Schmidt de la sede central de GTZ por su incesante apoyo a PROCOPA, a1 US National Marine Fisheries Service por las contribuciones de varios de sus cientificos, y por 6ltimo en orden per0 no en importancia, nuestro profundo agradecimiento a1 Dr. D. Pauly, por concebir el taller de trabajo que generd este libro y por el impulso brindado a todo el equipo comprometido hasta finalizar con las rnis de 400 piginas de esta obra. GTZ Foreword The pace of progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem is astounding: after only a decade of intensive research efforts, a fourth book on the subject can be published in the context of Peruvian-German cooperation in fisheries research. The former books Nifio, Su Irnpacto en la Fauna Marina\", edited by W. Amtz, A. Landa and J. . . Tarazona (Bol. Inst. Mar Peni - Callao, Vol. 1985); 11. \"The 15, Ecosistema de Afloramiento Peruano\", edited by H. Salzwedel and A. Landa (Bol. Inst. Mar Peni - Callao, Vol. extraord. 1988). The present volume is another example of the catalyzing effect of ICLARM on international and methodologically well-organized approach to a clearly defined goal. The four volumes, as the more bulky parts of a total of over 90 scientific contributions, are the most conspicuous evidence of the large written output produced by the Programa Cooperativo Peruano-Aleman de Investigaci6n funded by Deutsche Gesellschaft fiir Technische Zusarnrnenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH and the Instituto del Mar del Peni (IMARPE). It is hoped that the wealth of information contained in these publications will be recognized and used by the competent authorities for the purpose for which it was produced: to serve as an indispensable management basis for a rational and sustained exploitation of the unique fishery resources of the sea off Peru. Scientific progress of today is pushed ahead by an ever increasing potential of information analysis through electronic data elaboration. Contrary to a former tendency to publish only secondary (or elaborated) data, it appears now more useful to make the entire sets of original data available to the scientific public in order to allow for future possibilities of even more sophisticated or otherwise differently-oriented analysis. Many tables of the present volume attest to the application of this principle, as was already the case in the second book of the above list. The compilation of the present volume is considered the last step before the development of a simulation model for the management of the fishery resources of the Peruvian upwelling system. To develop such a model, all relevant biological, ecological, fishery and economic information will be integrated into one model, which will be parameterized using data sets now available as well as data that will emerge in the near future. With the help of this system, it should be possible to appraise at any time the advantages and disadvantages of different management options, taking into consideration the current size and fishery stocks, the ecological situation (and expected in the distribution area, the requirements of economical fishing-fleet management, the fish prices on domestic and international markets and other relevant parameters. The task of making this concluding step has been entrusted to IMARPE and ICLARM staff. In the Peruvian-German scientists from countries other than Peru and the Federal Republic of Germany have been involved. Substantial amounts of original data have been contributed by researchers of the USA (see Pauly and Tsukayama 1987). In view of the extensive activities of Soviet research vessels off the Peruvian coast, it would be of great importance to have public access to pertinent data collected in research efforts made by the Soviet Union. This could probably contribute to an even broader and more complete view of the ecosystem, in particular by inclusion of additional information on the straddling stocks of mackerel and horse mackerel living within and outside of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and affecting the anchoveta stocks as viii those at IMARPE, PROCOPA and ICLARM who organized and ran the August 1987 workshop on \"Models for Yield Prediction in the Peruvian Ecosystem\" which led to this book, as well as the editors of this magnificent volume. Martin Bilio ICLARM Foreword This book is the second volume produced by ICLARM dealing exclusively with Latin American resources. Like its predecessor, (\"The Peruvian Anchoveta and its Upwelling Ecosystem: Three Tsukayama, Reviews 15, 1987), this book presents studies based on long time series which are fully documented in the form of tables included in each contribution. This volume goes beyond its predecessor, however, in that all of its figures and tables have English and Spanish legends. Also, the report of the workshop upon which this book is based, is presented in Spanish (see Csirke et al., this vol.). We hope this will make this book more accessible than its predecessor to our colleagues in Latin America and, in particular, Peru. In addition, the editors have included as Appendix I of this book a brief documentation of twelve 5-114\" diskettes for MSDOS (i.e., IBM PC compatible) microcomputers, available to outside researchers for a modest fee from ICLARM, and which contain all data used by the authors of contributions included in this volume and its predecessor. The editors hope, as do we at ICLARM, that this will encourage researchers in Peru and of these data; such analyses will benefit them as much as it will benefit, in the long term, the management of the Peruvian fisheries. ICLARM is extremely pleased to have been able to contribute to the considerable efforts which went into the production of this volume. Particularly, I would like to express our thanks to Mr. Jaime Sobero Taira, Executive Director of IMARPE, and his predecessor, Mr. Rogelio Villanueva, for their support of the August 1987 workshop which led to this volume, and of the subsequent activities of this project; to Mr. Jaime Mendo and Ms. Isabel Tsukayama for their scientific and editorial inputs; to the as well as to Drs. A. Bakun, R. Mendelssohn and R. Parrish of the US National Marine Fisheries Service for their willingness to contribute to this effort. We at ICLARM look forward very much to our future cooperation with IMARPE and GTZ and hope that readers will find the present volume to be a useful contribution to the literature on Latin American resources.

Abstract A summary and the conclusions of a workshop on \"Models for Yield Prediction in the Peruvian Ecosystem\", held on 24-28 August 1987 at the Instituto del Mar del Peni are presented. Emphasis is given to those presentations and discussions which pertained to long time series and to consistent data collection and to the key elements of a future model of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem for use in fishe~y management. Resumen Se presenta un resumen y las wnclusiones del \"Taller de trabajo sobre modelos para la predicci6n del rendimiento en el sistema de afloramiento pemano\". realizado el 24-28 de Agosto de 1987 en el Instituto del Mar del P~N. Se pone 6nfasis en aquellas presentaciones y discusiones referentes a series de tiempo de largo plazo, recolecci6n de datos y a 10s elementos claves para un modelo future del emsistema de afloramiento peruano para ser usado en el manejo pesquero. *PROCOPA Contribution No. 86. ** Present address: Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. P.O. Box 20, Pacific Grove, California 93950, USA. La reciente publicacibn del libro \"The Peruvian anchoveta and its upwelling ecosystem: three decades of change\" (Pauly y Tsukayama 1987) pone a disposici6n de la comunidad cientifica internacional un gran voliimen de informaci6n a nivel mensual desde 1953 hasta 1982 sobre la poblaci6n y pesqueria de la anchoveta peruana y de las condiciones del ambiente marino frente al Perti. Se incluyen ademris, algunos anQisis preliminares y otros mris detallados de 10s datos presentados en el libro. Como una primera acci6n de seguimiento del valioso esfuerzo que signific6 reunir en un solo volumen datos de 30 aiios de investigaciones, PROCOPA, ICLARM e IMARPE decidieron convocar este taller de trabajo sobre \"Modelos para la predicci6n del rendimiento en el sistema de afloramiento peruano\" para lo cual se invit6 tanto a 10s autores que habian contribuido con el libro, asi como a otros expertos internacionales con el fin de discutir, ampliar y analizar la base de datos disponibles a la fecha. Los objetivos del taller de trabajo fueron: i> revisar la base de datos disponsible sobre el sistema de afloramiento peruano y discutir su utilidad para 10s fines de investigaci6n y ordenamiento pesquero; ii) identificar modelos predictivos y m6todos de ordenaci6n que, teniendo en cuenta las caractedsticas especiales del ecosistema del afloramiento peruano, puedan ser miis adecuados que aquellos modelos de rendimiento en uso, donde por lo general se asume que el sistema estfi compuesto por stocks o unidades poblacionales aisladas que poddan ser mantenidos en un estado de equilibria; iii) sugerir lineas de investigaci6n de mayor inter&, tanto para el personal del IMARPE, como el personal de PROCOPA y otros grupos o agencias de asistencia bilateral o intemacional vinculadas al sector pesquero peruano, asi como a la comunidad cientifica internacional. El taller de trabajo se llev6 a cabo en el Instituto del Mar, Chucuito, Callao, Perti, del24 al 28 de Agosto de 1987 y cont6 con la participaci6n de cientificos de IMARPE, PROCOPA e ICLARM como organismos auspiciadores, asi como de otros organismos nacionales e internacionales. La lista de participantes se presenta en Tabla 1. El taller se inici6 el dia lunes 24 de Agosto de 1987 con las palabras del Blgo. R. Villanueva, Director Ejecutivo del IMARPE, a cuya sugerencia se rindid homenaje a la fallecida Dra. H. Santander, guardando un minuto de silencio. Sigueron las palabras del Dr. H. Salzwedel, en representaci6n de PROCOPA y del Dr. D. Pauly, en representaci6n de ICLARM. El Alrnirante AP (R) R. Zevallos Newton, Presidente del Directorio del IMARPE, di6 por inaugurado el taller de trabajo. Por aclamaci6n se eligi6 al Blgo. J. Csirke, de la FAO, como Presidente del Taller de Trabajo y a1 Blgo. J. Mendo, del IMARPE como Relator, lwgo de lo cual se procedi6 con las sesiones del Taller segdn la agenda aprobada. Las sesiones consistieron de dos fases. Los dos primeros &as se efectuaron las presentaciones y discusiones de trabajos de investigaci6n y datos originales que amplian, complementan o analizan 10s datos y resultados ya publicados en el libro, luego de lo cud se procedi6 a formar dos grupos de trabajo con la finalidad de puntualizar dos de 10s aspectos generales de mayor importancia para el Taller: a) El muestreo, colecci6n y andlisis de datos, que fue asignado al grupo que se reuni6 bajo la coordinaci6n del Ing. J. Zuzunaga de IMARPE, actuando como relatora la Blga. G. CArdenas, y b) Desarrollo de modelos, asignado al grupo que se reuni6 bajo la coordinaci6n del Dr. P. Muck de PROCOPA y donde act116 como Relator el Dr. F. Chiivez, del Duke University. Luego de haber sido discutidas en plenario, las contribuciones de estos dos grupos de trabajo fueron incorporadas como partes principales del presente Informe.

Petit Thouars 115, Casilla 4682, Lima 100, Peni. publicados en el libro editado por Pauly y Tsukayama (1987), asi como la presentaci6n de nuevos datos que podrian ser considerados en las series de tiempo disponible. La primera presentaci6n estuvo a cargo del Dr. Max Agiiero (ICLARM), quien sustent6 su trabajo anterior (Agiiero 1987) y en el que se trata de integrar en un modelo de programaci6n matemgtica, 10s diferentes componentes del sector pesquero con el objeto de determinar el rendimiento econ6mico 6ptimo en la explotaci6n de un recurso (por ejemplo la anchoveta). Dicha presentacidn hace una revisi6n de la evoluci6n de la pesquen'a de la anchoveta desde el punto de vista econ61nic0, basado en 10s datos del libro antes mencionado. La versatilidad del modelo esti dada por la inclusi6n de diferentes curvas de rendimiento, datos ambientales, variaci6n de precios, esfuerzo de pesca, etc. En base a lo presentado por el Dr. Agiiero, se lleg6 a la conclusi6n de que si se tiene como objetivo maximizar el rendimiento econ6mico net0 de la pesqueria, seri necesario ajustar modelos como el propuesto donde se integra la parte biol6gica y 10s aspectos econ6micos. Esto daria lugar a un trabajo conjunto entre las entidades que se dedican a la investigaci6n (i.e., IMARPE) y a las que planifican la economfa en el sector pesquero (Instituto Nacional de Planificacion, Ministerio de Economii y Finanzas, etc.). La experiencia del colapso de la anchoveta en 10s aiios setenta y la necesidad de evitar que se repitan, nos obliga a 6sta integracidn, ya que por un lado se estari preservando el recurso y por otro, se obtendri un rendirniento econdmico superior. La presentaci6n del Dr. M. Bohle-Carbonell sobre cambios temporales del sistema de afloramiento peruano, analizando 10s datos de series de tiempo disponible, llega a la conclusi6n que muchos rangos de variables independientes estb describiendo un carnino fractional al azar (Bohle-Carbonell, este vol.). Los aniilisis espectrales de las series de tiempo muestran una variabilidad temporal de mucho ruido (\"noisy temporal changes\") con una seiial estacional debil (\"weak seasonal signal\"). Asi mismo, para rangos cubiertos'por la variable independiente no se ha encontrado un ajuste, por lo que 10s cambios de las variables dependientes son mis complicados que lo asumido por un modelo estadistico simple. La interpretaci6n geom6trica indica que dentro de 10s datos observados existen rangos de combinaciones de parhetros improbables. Ciertos valores o combinaciones de valores de la variable dependiente no son posibles de obtener. Desde el punto de vista bioldgico esto puede significar que el sistema se encuentra en mtiltiples estados de equilibrio. Esta presentaci6n sugiere que el modelaje y el aniilisis de datos debe tratarse con un sentido estadistico. El Dr. F. Chivez (Duke University, Marine Lab.) contribuy6 con la presentaci6n de un modelo para estirnar el potencial de la nueva producci6n primaria, usando series de tiempo mensuales de 1953 a 1984. El se bas6 en datos de afloramiento y profundidad de la termoclina publicados por Bakun (1987) y Brainard y McLain (1987), respectivamente. La profundidad de la termoclina fue convertida a concentraci6n de nitr6geno a 10s 60 m usando una relaci6n entre la profundidad de la termoclina y la concentraci6n de nitrato a 60 m. Durante 10s aiios de \"El Niiio\" aumenta el transporte vertical (afloramiento), pero la concentraci6n de nutrientes en las aguas afloradas son bajas. Este increment0 en el transporte vertical hace que la producci6n primaria estimada por el modelo durante 10s aiios \"El Niiio\" sea mis alta de la esperada (Chivez et al., este vol.). Este modelo simple puede ser muy 6til para el cdculo de 10s nutrientes en base a parhetros fisicos, sin embargo la pararnetrizaci6n de las variables debe mejorarse con el objeto de que el modelo adquiera una mayor robustez (ver Mendo et al., este vol.). Un resumen del estado actual de la investigaci6n cuantitativa del macrobentos en el Pe~ fue presentado por el Dr. Horst Salzwedel (PROCOPA). La mayoria de 10s trabajos cuantitativos se publicaron despu6s de 1980, siendo las Areas de mayor inter& la Bahia de Anc6n (40 krn a1 norte de Lima) y la plataforma continental entre 120s (Callao) y 3030's (Ecuador). Para la Bahia de Anc6n, existen series de tiempo de datos desde 1981 hasta la fecha, cubriendo asi afios normales y aiios \"Niiio\". Para el sublitoral, mis alli de 10s 25 m de profundidad hay ~610 tres cruceros efectuados por el IMARPE (1981, 1983 y 1984) de 10s cuales el material ha sido evaluado hasta el nivel de especies. Una recopilaci6n de 10s datos existentes revela 10s siguientes resultados: Niiios moderados (1976,1987) suben la concentraci6n promedio del oxigeno y la temperatura de las aguas cercanas a1 fondo s61o hasta 10s 9\"s apxfiximadamente. Se encuentran con altas biomasas y densidades y bajo n6mero de especies, siendo ellas bien adaptadas a las bajas concentraciones de oxigeno durante aiios normales. Uniendo 10s datos del sublitoral de 3 m hasta 4,000 m de profundidad resaltan desfases en las biomasas y las densidades en apdximadamente 80 m de profundidad que por ahora no se han podido explicar por la cantidad limitada de datos evaluados. Se concluye que 10s conocimientos cuantitativos del macrozoobentos son muy escasos para poderlos relacionar en forma adecuada con las largas series de tiempo que existen para otros datos abi6ticos y bi6ticos contenidos en el libro. Se recomienda continuar con las investigaciones regulares en la Bahia de Anc6n y ampliarlas a aguas m6s profundas. La Dra. P. Majluf (Cambridge University), present6 algunos aspectos de la ecologia y producci6n del lob0 fino (Arctocephalus australis) de Punta San Juan, Perti (15022's) durante 1983 y 1987, asi como de la dieta, comportamiento alimenticio, reproducci6n, crecimiento y mortalidad de crias. Los resultados indican que 10s lobos consumen predominantemente anchoveta adulta y que las variaciones en la disponibilidad local para la flota pesquera se reflejan en la composici6n y diversidad de la dieta. Con referencia a otras especies de lobs del mismo gCnero, las mortalidades encontradas fueron altas, especialmente durante el fen6meno de \"El Niiio\" 1982-83 y en 1984-85. Las mayores mortalidades de las crfas (de 0-30 dias de edad) durante la temporada de reproducci6n (40%), se debi6 principalmente a la alta densidad de hembras en la playa donde se reproducen. La mortalidad entre 10s 30 dias y un aiio de edad parece estar relacionada con cambios en la disponibilidad de anchoveta adulta para 10s lobos (Majluf, este vol.). El incremento de la poblacidn de lobs coincide con un incremento en su protecci6n; sin embargo no se descarta el efecto de la disponibilidad local del recurso de anchoveta principalmente para las madres. El maisis presentado por la Srta. Majluf, sugiere que se podria tomar a 10s lobos como un indicador de la disponibilidad local de anchoveta y por lo tanto, como una medida de la captura por unidad de esfuerzo. Por otro lado, dado el daiio que provoca la poblaci6n de lobs a 10s pescadores locales, es importante plantear la alternativa de utilizar a 10s lobs como un atractivo turistico. Esto permitiria el ingreso de divisas que compensm'an las perdidas de 10s pescadores en cuanto a redes se refiere. El Blgo. A. Alamo (IMARPE), expuso un anilisis preliminar del contenido estomacal de la anchoveta. En su presentaci6n hizo la comparaci6n de la &eta de la anchoveta bajo 10s efectos de \"El Nifio\" y bajo condiciones normales. Durante \"El Niiio\" se increment6 la proporci6n de copipodos consumidos por anchoveta. Para la interpretaci6n de estos cambios, se sugiri6 que se realice un anilisis multivariado tomando en cuenta variables tales como temperatura, hora, dia, estacionalidad, variaciones interanuales, latitud, etc. Este estudio se podd llevar a cab0 en el futuro utilizando la base de datos disponibles sobre contenido estomacal (ver Rojas de Mendiola, este vol., Alamo, este vol., Pauly et al, este vol.). El Blgo. H. Tovar (IMARPE) present6 10s resultados de un estudio sobre la predaci6n del piquero (Sula variegata, Tschudi) sobre algunos recursos icticos del litoral peruano, sosteniendo que en febrero de 1986, el piquero se aliment6 principalmente de anchoveta (Engraulis ringens J.) y en menor proporci6n de Cste t6pico se consider6 de interis el uso de bs bolos alimenticios como un indicador local de la poblaci6n de anchoveta y de su disponibilidad como alimento. Por otro lado, se enfatiz6 la necesidad de continuar con la obtenci6n de informaci6n mensual de las poblaciones de aves guaneras, asi como la realizaci6n de censos poblacionales para lo cud es necesario la coordinaci6n con la Direcci6n de Fertilizantes de Pesca-Peni. El Dr. P. Muck (PROCOPA), present6 una revisi6n general de las tendencias mostradas por las poblaciones incluidas en el libro de Pauly y Tsukayama (1987). En su andisis, mostr6 que. las poblaciones de anchoveta, bonito y aves guaneras disminuyeron entre 10s a5os 1960 y 1980, y la flota bolichera a partir de 1970. Sin embargo la disminuci6n de la flota no fue suficiente para evitar la dristica disminucidn de dichas poblaciones. La merluza (Merluccius gayi), jurel y caballa se mantuvieron estables y la sardina y 10s lobs marinos aumentaron su poblaci6n durante el period0 cubierto por el estudio. Se seiial6 que la sobrepesca fue la principal responsable del descenso de las poblaciones mencionadas en primer tCrmino. Por otro lado el jurel, merluza y caballa incrementaron sus poblaciones ya que sufrieron capturas limitadas y no son dependientes de la disponibilidad de anchoveta. El incremento del stock de sardina en cambio estd asociado a la disminuci6n del stock de anchoveta, la que preda 10s huevos de sardina y ademiis compite con ella por el alimento. Por otro lado, el incremento de la poblaci6n de lobos marinos se debi6 principalmente al incremento de la protecci6n legal. En general, 10s cambios biol6gicos observados en el ecosistema peruano en 10s 20 aiios, se deben principalmente a 10s efectos directos e indirectos de la sobrepesca y al fendmeno de \"El Niiio\" que actu6 solo como un factor agravante (Muck, este vol.). La Blga. S. Carrasco (IMARPE), present6 las variaciones de la biomasa del zooplancton en el mar peruano en base a muestreos realizados por WE durante el periodo 1964-1987. Los resultados indicaron una disminuci6n notable de 10s valores de biomasa a travds de 10s aiios (ver Carrasco y Lozano, este vol.). Se observa una similitud entre las variaciones en la biomasa de zooplancton y la variaci6n en la biomasa de anchoveta, sugiriendo que en la dCcada de 10s afios 60 existia un wistema (no s61o en lo que se refiere a peces pel6gicos) diferente al que existe actualrnente. Igualmente durante 10s afios \"El Nifio\" existen cambios en la distribuci6n de zooplancton, en 10s que se observa que 10s mkimos en la abundancia se encuentran m8s alejados de la costa que en condiciones normales y asi mismo, una disminuci6n en la abundancia de zooplancton. Se concluye al respecto la necesidad de estudiar las causas de ese decrecimiento en relaci6n con el fitoplancton, el consumo de peces planctivoros, etc. Se hizo hincapiC que aiin existen muchos datos hist6ricos que necesitan trabajarse. Se recornienda que esta informaci6n sea extraida, estandarizada y publicada. El Blgo. J. Csirke (FAO), present6 un aniilisis de las fluctuaciones del coeficiente de capturabilidad mensual para el periodo comprendido entre el aiio 1961 y el aiio 1972, el cud serA ampliado con nuevos datos disponibles en IMARPE para 10s aiios ds recientes (ver Csirke, este vol.). Los resultados presentados muestran una clara estacionalidad en la fluctuaci6n del coeficiente de capturabilidad, el que alcanza valores mhos en 10s meses de verano y disminuye considerablemente en invierno. El resultado m6s interesante es que 10s datos muestran una relaci6n inversa entre el coeficiente de capturabilidad y la biomasa de anchoveta, donde el coeficiente de capturabilidad aumenta en forma exponencial a medida que la biomasa total disminuye. Este tip0 de relaci6n es semejante al encontrado en algunas poblaciones de peces peliigicos pequeiios en otras partes del mundo, y constituye una primera prueba de que en la anchoveta peruana tambiCn se da este tipo de relaci6n depensatoria que implica un aumento de la mortalidad por pesca a menor abundancia del recurso. Este hallazgo tambiCn refuerza la observaci6n hecha a inicios de 10s aiios setenta de que la capturabilidad de la anchoveta no era constante, en base a lo cud se abandon6 la colecci6n y uso de datos de captura por unidad de esfuerzo para estirnar fluctuaciones del recurso y para la aplieaci6n de modelos de producrci6n. Los resultados presentados demuestran sin embargo que, al ser posible determinar la posible relaci6n entre el coeficiente de capturabilidad y la biomasa total, es posible usar esta informaci6n para corregir 10s valores de captura y esfuerzo. Se recornend6 por tanto que se reinicie e intensifique la colecci6n de datos de esfuerzo usando en lo posible medidas alternativas del poder de pesca, 10s cuales constituyen un medio litil para monitorear las fluctuaciones de la abundancia a bajo costo, 10s cuales sin embargo, se debedn validar y complementar con estimaciones hechas por otros mCtodos. El Dr. P. Lagos (IGP) present6 un trabajo sobre la variabilidad estacional de la temperatura superficial a lo largo de la costa del Perk Usando las series de tiempo mensuales de calor net0 local, transporte Ekman y profundidad de la isoterma de 14OC, se ha llegado a pronosticar la estacionalidad media de la temperatura superficial del mar. El concluye que la estacionalidad media consiste de una variabilidad anual debida al calor local, probablemente con un cambio pequefio de la amplitud y fase de aiio a aiio y de una variabilidad semi-anual debido a la dinhica interna del ocesino. Los resultados del estudio de balance del calor pueden ser usados en el desanollo de 10s modelos fisico-biol6gicos que requieren las tendencias de las condiciones ambientales. Modelaje del Ecosistema Peruano Necesidad de un Modelo En la actualidad 10s administradores de la pesca no disponen de un instrumento para predecir las fluctuaciones anuales de la biomasa de recursos pesqueros. La pesqueria pel6gica frente a Perti est4 compuesta de miiltiples especies, cuya abundancia relativa es una funci6n de la pesqueria y de 10s cambios bi6ticos y abi6ticos. Para tratar con un gran n6mero de propiedades que varian con el tiempo y que afectan en forma diferenciada la abundancia de cada especie, es necesario alg6n tipo de modelo computarizado capaz de simular el ecosistema peltigico. Este modelo ayudarii a estimar el esfuerzo con que deberii explotarse cada una de las especies que componen el ecosistema. Por ejemplo, el modelo podrti mostrar como la biomasa de la especie A podria afectar la biomasa de la especie B (para la costa peruana las especies A y B podrian ser anchoveta y sardina). El modelo podria tener no ~610 valor predictivo sino tambiCn de diagnbstico, por lo que podria utilizarse tambien para explorar posibles interacciones. En este nivel, el modelo identificaria 10s componentes criticos del ecosistema (y sus funciones que la deciden) lo cud requiere estudios miis detallados. En el futuro, Cste modelo tambiCn proveeria 10s datos requeridos en un modelo econ6mico. Tipo de Modelo Necesario Este t6pico requiere de un amplio estudio. Se sugiere varios niveles o tipos de modelo que pueden intentarse: Un modelo de \"anchoveta\" que utilice la serie de tiempo disponible para predecir el reclutamiento en base a las relaciones con 10s factores bi6ticos y abi6ticos para el manejo de 10s recursos. Un modelo de evaluaci6n de stock de peces que incluya s61o aquellos elementos de magnitud suficiente como para alterar 10s stocks de peces. Por ejemplo, 10s mamiferos que no predan peces a altos niveles deberiin ser excluidos. Un modelo del ecosistema que adicione al modelo de evaluaci6n del stock de peces aquellos elementos del sistema peliigico que no fueron inclufdos en el ejercicio previo. Estos elementos (por ej. aves y mamiferos) no afectan la variabilidad de 10s stocks de peces, sin embargo, son afectados por la variabilidad en 10s stocks de peces. Estos elementos tienen valor socio-econ6mico y reauieren ser tornados en consideraci6n. El desarrollo del modelo deberii considerar &emire el gran objetivo, cud es definir el nivel de explotacibn de un stock y la especie preferida. Validez del Modelo El modelo contemplad, en base a la sene de tiempo disponible, (1) la entrada de datos para el modelo, y (2) la verificaci6n de la validez del modelo. Un modelo pmdictivo y realfstico deberii captar la estructura esencial de la serie de tiempo existente. A continuaci6n se presenta el concept0 iterativo simple del desarrollo del modelo: a) empezar con el modelo conceptual miis simple, b) desarrollar funciones de transferencia, c) correr el modelo utilizando datos mensuales y comparar 10s datos observados, y d) mantener o cambiar las funciones de transferencia para obtener un \"mejor\" dato sirnulado. Forma Conceptual del Modelo El modelo conceptual deberti incluir: 1) producci6n primaria y secundaria, 10s peces (anchoveta, sardina, jurel, caballa y merluza) y la pesqueria como parte del componente bi6tico; y 2) temperatura superficial del mar, fuerzas metereoldgicas locales y remotas y temperatura subsuperficial como parte del componente abi6tico. El modelo de ecosistema incluir6 aves y mamiferos (ver Fig. 1). Las dos dimensiones predictivas importantes del modelo son el espacio y el tiempo, requiri6ndose tambiCn la componente geogrfifica. La Fig. Elernentos a ser considerados en un modelo de simulaci6n del ecosistema de aforamiento peruano. Noiar el papel importante de temperatura superficial del mar (TSM) y 10s parhnetros derivados del viento. Fig. 1. Elements to be cansidered in a simulation model de distribuci6n de la anchoveta, esto es 4-140s y 60 rnillas mar afuera, que de ser necesario podria ser dividida. Los Datos y sus Caracten'sticas La serie de tiempo existente, gran pate de la cud ha sido compilada y publicada en Pauly y Tsukayama (1987) provee una base de datos suficiente para iniciar el modelaje de multiespecies. Las series de tiempo de datos que atin faltan (por ej. zooplancton) deberh reconstruirse utilizando la literatura y datos no publicados de IMARPE y/o por funciones de transferencia a partir de por ej., la producci6n primaria. El modelo deber6 simular 10s cambios de 10s peces en cada paso. Ello significa que el modelo deberii incluir efectos no lineales. Existen modelos que ya simulan pasos como cambios en las poblaciones de peces, pudiendo incorporarse dichas ecuaciones en el presente modelo. Los diferentes compartimentos del modelo deberiin mantener un grado similar de complejidad de forma que Sean compatibles. Por ejemplo, el compartimento de producci6n primaria deberii ser compatible con el de produccidn de peces. La gran cantidad de caracteristicas ~ceanogr~cas deberii ser investigada, poniendo particular atenci6n en 10s cambios que pudieran no haber sido observados en las estaciones costeras. Un ejemplo es la distribuci6n de las aguas sub-tropicales superfkiales (ASS) que podrian definir el tamafio del habitat de la anchoveta. Existen evidencias de cambios sistemiiticos en la distribucicin de estas masas de aguas con anterioridad a la generacidn de perturbaciones que se propagan hacia el Este (ondas Kelvin) en el Paeifico Oriental (Bohle- Carbonell, este vol.). La fuerza remota es responsable de 10s dradticos efectos de \"El Nifio\"; sin embargo, 10s cambios que ocurren antes del fen6meno de \"EI Niiio\" tambiCn pueden tener efectos dramiiticos sobre las poblaciones de peces. Se recornienda mantener comunicaci6n con modeladores que trabajan a mayor escala (por ejemplo con aquellos que trabajan con la zona del Pacifico Tropical de Australia a AmCrica del Sur). Acciones Futuras Deberii continuarse con el muestreo que provee 10s datos para la sene de tiempo existente. Estos incluiriin datos de biomasa temporal y espacial, elementos biol6gicos del modelo, comportamiento de alimentacibn, tasas de explotaci6n (captura), asi corn factores abi6ticos tales como viento y datos hidr~gr~cos. Los datos deberh estandarizarse y analizarse en tiempo real a fin de proveer las entradas de datos requeridas en el modelo. Se pondrd especial atenci6n a la colecci6n de datos de composici6n, biomasa y producci6n del fitoplancton y zooplancton. Para lograr el gran objetivo del modelaje, cual es el de crear un instrumento para el manejo pesquero, IMARPE y PROCOPA deberh formalizar un comprorniso para este modelaje mediante la conformaci6n de un grupo de trabajo. Los esfuerzos para el modelaje ddxrh iniciarse lo antes posible. La informaci6n compilada y publicada en Pauly y Tsukayama (1987), en este volumen, asi como 10s datos de IMARPE afin no procesados, son suficientes para iniciar el modelaje del ecosistema del mar peruano. Analisis y Colecci6n de Datos Las diferentes actividades que deben desarrollarse en el anilisis y colecci6n de datos han sido divididas de acuerdo a la necesidad de implements nuevos datos de series de tiempo, al procesamiento de Cstos y a las prioridades que se deberh tener en cuenta para el modelaje del ecosistema. Estas se resumen de la siguiente forma: A. Coleccih de Datos Dentro de la gama de informaci6n factible de ser colectada se ha priorizado aquellas indicadas en la Tabla 2 adjunta. Tabla 2.

Evaluaci6n de las prioridades y problem6tica Los datos colectados por IMARPE deben estar orientados al logo de dos aspectos fundarnentales: - Optimizar el asesorarniento a1 gobierno, particularmente al sector pesquero en la toma de decisiones para un mejor manejo de 10s recursos. - Desarrollar modelos propios del ecosistema aplicando metodologias que tengan capacidad predictiva. Para el logo de estos objetivos se seiiala la necesidad de resolver problemas referentes a: - Alto costo que requiere la toma de informaci6n a travCs de las exploraciones en el mar, muestreo de pesquen'as, adquisicidn y mantenimiento de equipos de laboratorio, transporte, etc. - Insuficiencia de recursos humanos y necesidad de capacitacih permanente del personal existente que se &carga de la colecci6n de datos. - Deficiencia de coordinacidn y apoyo de entidades estatales y privadas del sector pesquero e instituciones dines. C. Analisis de la Informacih La informaci6n colectada procesada y analizada utilizando m6todos disponibles, enfatizhdose la necesidad de estandarizaci6n de 10s mismos y el uso mdximo de las computadoras disponibles en el IMARPE. El objetivo final deber6 ser la publicaci6n de 10s resultados. D. Politica de intercambio de datos El intercambio de datos se plantea en dos niveles: - Difusi6n inmediata de datos, sujeto simplemente a la culminaci6n de su recopilaci6n, consistencia y procesamiento bilsico. - Difusidn mediata, con la elaboraci6n de informes cientificos e ir Torrnes varios. La oportuna difusi6n de la informaci6n en ambos niveles estar6 condicionada por las facilidades de edicidn y publicaci6n de inforrnes. Conclusiones y Recomendaciones En base a las presentaciones que se hicieron durante 10s dos primeros &as del taller y las discusiones sostenidas en Plenario y en 10s Grupos de trabajo, se lleg6 a las conclusiones y recomendaciones siguientes: a) El conocimiento cientffico acumulado hasta la fecha debe volcarse en un modelo que permita predecir las fluctuaciones anuales de la biomasa de recursos pesqueros, ademis de poder ser utilizado para explorar 10s resultados de distintas alternativas de administracidn o manejo pesquero. b) Ademis del modelo del ecosistema del mar peruano se requiere un modelo que integre tanto la parte biolbgica, como 10s aspectos econ6micos. Este tipo de modelo seri particularmente 6til si se tiene como objetivo maxirnizar el rendimiento econ6mico net0 de las pesquerias peruanas y requeriril un trabajo y colaboraci6n mis estrecha entre las entidades nacionales que se dedican a la investigaci6n (IMARPE) y 10s que planifican la economia en el sector pesquero (Ministerio de Pesqueria, Instituto Nacional de Planificaci6n, Ministerio de Economia y Finanzas). c) Los esfuerzos para concretar la formulaci6n de estos modelos deben iniciarse lo antes posible, considerhdose que la informacidn publicada en el libro editado por D. Pauly e I. Tsukayama recientemente, la informaci6n incluida en Cste volumen y 10s datos adn no procesados que posee IMARPE son suficientes para inciar el modelaje del ecosistema del mar peruano. d) Para permitir que este modelo pueda ser empleado en forma efectiva en el futuro, se recomienda que se continden 10s muestreos que proveen de datos para actualizar las series de tiempo disponibles. Esto incluye datos sobre cambios de la biomasa y las capturas, asi como otros elementos biol6gicos (alimentaci6n, plancton, etc.) y factores abi6ticos (vientos, datos hidrogri4fkos, etc.). e) Para lograr este gran objetivo de modelar el ecosistema del mar peruano, el IMARPE deberil propiciar la formaci6n de grupos de trabajo conformados por cientificos altamente especializados del pais y del extranjero, cuya participaci6n en este ejercicio p& ser canalizada en base a la cooperaci6n t6cnica bilateral e internacional ya existentes u otros que podn'an instituirse en el futuro. Dentro de este contexto, PROCOPA ha jugado un rol catalizador muy importante que, en opini6n del Taller de trabajo, deberia ser continuado y reforzado para apoyar al IMARPE en la puesta en priictica e implementaci6n de las otras recomendaciones que se hacen en este Informe. Se consider6 que tarnbi6n se deberia estimular la participaci6n de otras agencias y organismos de asistencia tknica intemacional, resalthdose el apoyo recibido de ICLARM, asi como la participaci6n de la FA0 en este taller. f) Con respecto al colapso de importantes pesquerfas y la disminuci6n de algunos recursos del ecosistema del mar peruano tales como la anchoveta, el bonito y las aves guaneras, el taller concluyd que adn cuando 10s cambios del ambiente han jugado un rol importante, fue la sobrepesca la causa principal del colapso y disminuci6n de estas poblaciones. Otras poblaciones como jurel, merluza y caballa han aumentado en 10s dltimos aiios ya que han sido explotadas en forma limitada y no dependen de la disponibilidad de anchoveta. En cambio el aurnento de la poblaci6n de sardina si parece estar asociado con la disminuci6n de las poblaciones de anchoveta, a nivel de predaci6n de huevos y competencia por alimento. g) En el taller se mostr6 que es posible encontrar una estrecha relaci6n entre el coeficiente de capturabilidad y la biomasa total, lo cud permitiria corregir 10s datos de captura por unidad de esfuerzo cuyo uso para fines de evaluaci6n de la pesca se abandon6 a inicios de 10s aiios 70 a1 constatar que la capturabilidad no era constante. Dado que seria posible corregir y usar 10s valores de captura y esfuerzo, se recomienda que se reinicie y se refuerce la coleccidn y procesarniento de este tipo de datos, 10s cuales constituyen un medio iitil y de bajo costo para monitorear las fluctuaciones de la abundancia del recurso, complementando asi las estirnaciones que se hacen con otros mCtodos. Esta informaci6n de captura y esfuerzo podrii tambiCn ser empleada en andisis econdmicos de la pesca. h) El taller tambiCn acord6 resaltar que hay informaci6n sobre la abundancia y comportamiento de aves y madferos marinos que pueden ser empleados como indicadores de posibles cambios en el ecosistema y en las poblaciones de peces. Se acord6 por lo tanto recomendar que se continde con la colecci6n y el andisis de la informacih mensual de la poblaci6n de las aves guaneras y que se prosiga con 10s censos poblacionales en coordinaci6n con la Direcci6n de Fertilizantes de Pesca-Peni. Se recomienda asi mismo que se considere tambiCn la posibilidad de emplear 10s bolos alimenticios de aves guaneras para obtener informaci6n sobre estructuras por tarnaiios y disponibilidad de anchoveta. Se sefial6 tarnbiCn que 10s lobos marinos podrian ser empleados como indicadores de la disponibilidad local de anchoveta. i) En cuanto a otros datos biol6gicos, se recomienda que se intensifiquen 10s estudios de alirnentacibn de peces en sus diferentes estadios y, como parte del sistema de colecci6n de informaci6n en el mar, se recomienda que se establezcan estaciones fijas para la coleccidn de muestras y datos biol6gicos en forma similar a como viene haciCndolo el grupo de oceanografia del IMARPE para obtener datos abi6ticos. j) Para mejorar la colecci6n y anilisis de datos se recornend6 que se realicen conversatorios peri6dicos para evaluar 10s sistemas de colecci6n y procesamiento de datos. k) Se resalt6 que uno de 10s objetivos finales y principales de todo trabajo cientifico es publicar 10s resultados de las investigaciones y se recornend6 que 10s cientificos del IMARPE tengan esto como meta final. Para ello se requeririi que al preparar proyectos de investigaci6n se asegure la asignaci6n de fondos necesarios para publicar 10s hallazgos del proyecto. Referencias M. 1987.

Abstract The behavior of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem is shown to be determined to a large degree by random events which-make it oscillate between multiple disjoint states. The characterize the development of new monitoring schemes and will lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of the interface between physics and biology in the Peruvian upwelling system. Resumen Se demuestra que el comportarniento del ecosistema peruano de afloramiento esti determinado, en un alto grado, por eventos aleatorios que lo hacen oscilar entre mmiltiples estados disjuntos. La media caracteristica de estos procesos aleatorios no estacionarios fui identificado parcialmente como un resultado de procesos correlacionados de ruido fractal. Es decir, una prediccibn de futuros cambios del ecosistema peruano de afloramiento debe considerar su naturaleza estocistica. Predicciones relevantes, para decisiones administrativas, de periodos mas all6 de algunos meses estan probablamente fuera de alcance. Sin embargo, fueron identificados parimetros fisicos, 10s cuales estan mas cercanamente relacionados a cambios de la biomasa de anchoveta que aquellos comunmente observados para caracterizar 10s eventos de El Niiio. Esto permite el desarrollo de nuevos esquemas de monitoreo y conduciri a un mejor entendiiiento de las dinimicas de la interfase entre fisica y biologia en el sistema peruano de afloramiento. Introduction The Peruvian upwelling system is one of the most productive fishing grounds of the world. Its fishery yields depend in complex manner, as a monograph edited by conditions. However, clear under- standing of mechanisms is still lacking. The question to be tackled concerns the predictability of the upwelling system. However, no prognostic will be given; rather, the past will be investigated to determine how much of the observed changes were due to random events. Thus, it is the degree of stochasticity of the Peruvian upwelling system which is dealt with here. Less stochasticity will be assumed to imply a high degree of predictability. It may seem strange to attribute the label \"stochastic\" to an ecosystem, especially if, as generally, each individual interaction in this ecosystem can be described in a deterministic way. However a deterministic description of any system is no assurance against probabilistic properties of that same system (Lasota prerequisite of stochastic chaotic behavior, is a nonlinear and dissipative dynamic system (Bohr and Cvitanovic 1987). This prerequisite is fulfilled with regard to the nonlinearity of the physical laws of hydrodynamics and to most biological processes. The nondissipative character of the system will depend on a special choice of the dynamic constants. The physics of the Peruvian upwelling system are locally and remotely forced by meteorological events. local winds drive the upwelling and the remote winds over the central Pacific trigger perturbations which may reach the Peruvian coast. The fluctuations of the winds around the seasonal and diurnal average conditions are random. When the forcing is stochastic, e.g., a white noise, the response of the forced system may quite well be deterministic, if it is a well-tuned oscillator. But, does the Peruvian upwelling system function like a well-tuned oscillator? The Peruvian upwelling system is sensitive to El Niiio - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. These events are understood as produced by the feedback of the ocean atmosphere dynamics (Philander and Seigel 1985) leading first to a slow build-up of potential energy and second to its quick release. How the release is triggered is not well understood independently of the trigger, (D. Seidov, Acad. USSR, may mechanism (Ponte 1986). Thus, the timing and strength of El Niiio events are probably random occurrences. Going up the hierarchy, the biology of the Peruvian upwelling system is, as anywhere, a complex web of interactions between different species and the nonbiological environment. The interactions may be known or hypothesized to exist, but are generally not evaluated regard their importance. Thus, evaluate the influence of the stochasticity inherent to the physical environment on the biology. Some interactions of the species in and with the Peruvian upwelling system are known, e.g., the cannibalization of anchoveta eggs by anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) (see Pauly and Soriano, this vol.). Historically, up to some months before the occurrence of the surface signal of the 1971-1972 El Niiio, a large stock of anchoveta had been supported by the Peruvian upwelling system and this stock formed the base of the largest fishery in the world. After the collapse, the stock never recovered to former levels. for the collapse and the nonrecovery of anchoveta, although this may imply a knowledge of the degree to which the observed exhibit variability - at least partly - which is stochastic in character. Furthermore, little known on the response characteristics of the biological components Thus, the observed changes of the Peruvian upwelling system may be understood as random events. The degree of randomness inherent to the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem will determine the predictability of future changes. In order to do so, several of the time series of 30 years monthly means, recently made available by Pauly be used. First, some known features of the time series will be interpreted with respect to the stochasticity of the underlying mechanisms. Then, the theoretical background of the hypotheses adopted for further data methodological considerations concerning the following section refers mainly to results of time series analysis on physical parameters as published by Brainard and McLain (1987), Bakun (1987) and Pauly et al. (1987). Most of these time series cover about 30 years by monthly means, with some temporal interpolations. Seasonality and Anomalies The parameters to be considered the temperature found at the surface and at depths down to about 75 m. At greater depths, e.g., at the depth of the 14' isotherm, the seasonal signal is not visible any longer. These features are well described by the autocorrelation functions to +I- 0.8) by the seasonal cycle. Fluctuations of the local SST, e.g., La Punta and Talara, are explained to about 10% by the seasonal cycle. At depth, e.g., at the depth of the 14\" isotherm, 5% of the annual temperature extrema are explained by seasonal fluctuations. This behavior shows that the seasonal signal is generally of limited importance in these depths. This lesson seems to contradict the be seen by eye. Autocorrelation functions calculated from the time series after to 12 depending on the parameter, and does not increase significantly for longer lags (up to 48 months). The time series of anomalies displays events of the same sign of longer and shorter duration. The amplitudes of these anomalies are, on the average, about one standard deviation. Thus, from the seasonal cycle, no appears to be present in the temperature time series. The next group of parameters to be discussed concerns wind forcing and sea surface level. Local sea Oscillation Index (SOI) does not dominate the variance of the time series. Time series of these parameters show, after suppression of the seasonal signal, no well-defined periodic structure. In general, no qualitative differences between these time series and those of the temperature-related parameters are found. It is common to both groups of parameters that the autocorrelation drops to about 0.7, or less, at a time lag of 2 months. Thus less than 50% of the variance in can be explained by the observations 2 months before. To date, the time series on biological parameters have not been subjected to any analysis similar to those performed with the physical parameters. Visual inspection shows some biannual variability for the anchoveta biomasses and several pulses starting from different background levels. The overall impression is that of a more regular behavior than for the physical parameters, combined with larger amplitudes of the fluctuations. These observations suggest that most of the variability in the time series is caused by relatively short, not-correlated events. Periodic, mainly present but are submerged by a strong background noise. In order to test this, a statistically robust form of spectral analysis has Preprocessing Spectral and other analyses have applied to the SST-related time series (spatial mean temperature and local measurements at La Punta, Callao) as well as to other centered about 4.25 cm (recruits) and 16.25 cm (mature adult fish). It is assumed that the two biological time series contain most physical and nonphysical influences affecting anchoveta. Thus, they are taken as a measure of the integrated response of the to anthropogenic (fishery-induced) perturbations. these sources provide detailed descriptions of the time series and their derivation from raw data. The period considered, January 1953 to December 1977, excludes the extreme Niiio and its possible preludes from Table Monthly time on the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem analyzed in this contribution?

Thus, e.g., rate of change of Dl4 is coded 5'. the analysis. Furthermore, at least some of the time series on physical parameters seem to have changed their behavior in the late 1970s, compared to the preceding period. Thus limiting the analysis to the period 1953 to 1977 favors stationarity of the derived statistics. Each time series has been analyzed in four different forms: (i) in its original form but with interpolated missing values, (ii) after transformation as described below, (iii) after differentiating in time time series and normalizes the deviations from the seasonal signal. For transformation, the median-seasonal cycles of the time series have been calculated. In order to get reliable and independent estimates of the medians, grouped into season (January, February, March = summer, etc.). Then each data point has been replaced by an index (1,2, ... 12) indicating the twelfth-quantile (quantile width: 8.33%) use medians and quantiles instead of means and standard deviations is due to the need to calculate robust statistical estimates from are used because these describe directly some common statistics data sets.

Bands of high variance are identified as \"peaks\" if the confidence widths of the confidence show the variability on the time scales longer than 5 years. The are generally less The is of periods, a feature typical for time series of random sequences of individual events. No important changes in the main features of the spectra were found when the spectra of the time series themselves were compared to their rates of change. Thus, the time series of the observed variables and their rate of change are similar sequences of random events. No significant peaks were found, except for absorbed solar radiation \"Q\" at a period of 12 months. Thus, only this parameter has a broadly, including the spectral bandwidths, period range from 18 to 9 months. All spectra of original time series show bands of high variance centered around a 12-month period. statistically distinguished from the events which form the background signal at neighboring periods. The seasonal fluctuations have high variances but vary so much at longer time scales that they are not statistically different from fluctuations at other periods. Some spectra of the transformed time series show relatively high, but not statistically different variances for the period range 45 to 25 months.

This signal is most probably due to the mean time interval between two successive El Niiio events. Therefore, should be noted that the spectra of the transformed time series on the depth of the 14' isotherm is flat for periods longer than 12 months. One result of this is that the temporal changes of the temperature structure of the upper layer are different at depth and near the surface. This corroborates similar results obtained by Brink et time scales. To summarize: the spectra have properties which are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the time series are composed of a small of periodic the Peruvian upwelling system should be described as a sequence of random events. Periodic deterministic patterns are of little a substantial part of the observed changes in the Peruvian upwelling system are due to sequences of random events. Here a mathematical tool will be developed to handle sequences of random events. The general model was used (Turcotte 1988). Here, \"Y\" takes the place of any derived quantity, but could be the observation itself; \"x\" is the value of the independent variable at the starting point and \"t\" is its increment; \"a\" is a constant to be determined, and \"V\" is a stationary random variable taken from a distribution with unknown moments which, likewise, have to be determined if the process (1) is to be completely described. Thus, equation (1) defines Y by a random process which is nonstationary in t if a is not equal to zero. If E() is a linear estimator of the expectation, e.g., of the mean, then (1) may be rewritten: Averaging is done over an ensemble of Y values at different starting points x and same increments t. Thus, E() is an ensemble average and its expected value varies with ta. If Equation (3) holds (x)). It can be expected that given values of a and of the statistical moments of V hold only for a limited range of t values. Their lower and upper bounds give the range within which the process (1) is correlated. Equations (2.1) and (2.2) can now be interpreted on three different levels. First, the equations give only an average power law dependence of Y as a function oft. Second, the equations describe the average geometrical properties of Y as a function of t. Third, they determine the nonstationary mean characteristic of the random process (1). In order to illustrate the random process characteristics of the model, equation (1) may be rewritten as (where the x has been dropped for convenience). Thus, the normalized increment of Y is a random variable. Equation (4) is identified as a definition of a random walk, if a is equal to 112 and V is Gaussian. If a is zero and V is Gaussian, then (4) describes a Gaussian white noise process. Thus, (1) is a generalization of a first order stationary noise process. The geometrical interpretation can be performed by comparing to the particular forms of (1). First, the \"new\" value of Y is estimated in \"one step\": and of estimation Y lead to the same expected value of new Y, if holds. Equation (6) is the definition of the fractal dimension a. Here, a relates the ratio of the scales of increments T and t to the number of repetitive use of the smaller scale to \"measure same object\". The object measured is the mean difference between old Y and new Y as a function of the increment of the independent variable. Using (6) in (5.1) gives the expectation of Y(T) as function increment Thus, prognostic of length, for example, \"t = 0.1 * T can be done in 10 steps only if a is equal to one. In consequence, (nearly) any ad hoc decomposition of the increment T a given process (1) into smaller will have no influence the sampling frequency, for any quantity varying with (1) if the is neither nor linear. Summarizing the properties of the model (1): If a is greater than zero and fixed for a given interval oft, then (1) describes a correlated random process which has a mean fractal and defined for the given developed Furthermore, the main lines of interpretation and the questions to be answered by the analysis are presented. Estimates of the nonstationarity of the time series are considered first. Prognostics can be given only if the degree spectral slopes are their variance spectra (Turcotte 1988). be considered. The last quantity analyzed involves the concept of the phase space and the distribution of observations (the phase points) in this space. Here correlation over distance in the phase space and its geometry is used to draw conclusions regarding the interdependence of different parameters, e.g., SST and SOI. Direct estimates of the exponent a of are by means for the widest (centered) interval of the independent variable for which: (1) the square of the regression coefficient is above fiom zero (95% confidence level) and (3) the interval of the independent variable for which the regression holds can be divided in subintervals for which conditions (1) and (2) are frned. Im order to estimate the degree of nonstationarity of the time series, three quantities have been ana1yd using the model (1): calculated from two lagged fractions of the same time series as a function of the lag; (ii) the covariances of two lagged fixtiom of the same he series minus the variance found for lag zero as a function of the lag; (iii) the nmb of extnema maxima) observation as a function of the obsewations period. Nqnstationarity of the time series will show up either via the difference of rnean values and of mvariances, whieh depend on the lag, or via the counts exmma (which do not increase linearly with of mean values and covariances of the time series for lags between 3 to 97 months was analyzed by it technique based on a procedure in McHardy and Cxrny (1987). Two fractions of the time series, each about 8 years long, were &en, which are separated: by a given lag The difference of their means and the difference of their covariances are estimated. This for abut 100 startingpoints (see equation 1) along the entire time ese differences are analyzed as a function of the lag t. If tahe averaging period is sufficieildy long and if rhe process the Any drift rilifferences would trend, is, of no of increasing length, 3 to 97 months, as was the median counts for about 100 starting points. The threshold has been defined by either the seasonal 2/12quantiles or the 10/12quantile (Fig. are to the and estimated as one. Spectral Slopes analyses covers the time interval from 5 months to 5 years. Spectra have been calculated as Then, of the variance as a function of the period was analyzed. In order to do so, a power function was fitted to the spectra for the range of periods from 60 to 6 months. The exponent (b) of the power function of the dependence of spectral variance was related by (1988) exponent a of the CFNP process (1) via: A white noise process is described by a flat variance spectrum, while a random walk process has a variance spectrum that increases in proportion to period squared. and relative importance of the process by which the time series has been generated. If no mean slope can be estimated, then CFNP of form (1) do not contribute to the observed time series. Distribution of Phase Points This analysis starts from the concept of the phase space. Two variables observed at the same time or one variable and its rate of change can be plotted as a function of each other. The surface defined by this procedure can be understood as a (two-dimensional) phase space. The observa- tions are the discrete representation of the phase line (Fig. 3). A cyclically changing variable and its rate of change or two variables which are out of phase but have a fixed phase lag would define a closed loop (i.e., phase space. Less well correlated variables would define a cloud of points in the phase space. Here, only one case of a phase cycle has been found; it pertained to absorbed solar radiation and its rate of change. All other clouds of phase points scattered without structure over the phase space. The mean geometrical of clouds points was analyzed using the approach of Lovejoy et al. (1986). If two independent random variables are plotted against each other, then their scatter plot will show no internal structure. Furthermore, the phase points of two parameters related in complex fashion will be scattered over their space likewise such that no of two such parameters are possible. Thus, are areas in the neighborhood of a given phase point which will never include a phase point. phase space of voids, forbidden regions, and of phase points are distributed. Therefore, subregions of the scatter plot with high and low density of points will be found, and the number of points found in the neighborhood of a given point will increase in proportion to the power of less than two (i.e., the square of the distance). Thus the local dimension of the scatter plot of phase points will differ from two. The quantity to analyze, in accordance with the CFNP model (I), is the average number of phase points within a circle of a given radius as a function of the radius. The phase space defined bv the observed minima and maxima of the Darameter has been divided in M cells, M being eiual to the number observations (N) squared. fashion will tend to form a phase line along a diagonal of the phase space. In this case, the number of points within a circle of a given radius increases proportionally to the length of the radius. If, on the other hand, the phase points were distributed regularly on a cartesian grid, counting the number within circles (large increase to the that the number of points increases proportionally to the square of the radius. Thus, if the distribution of phase points on the 3. Two examples of a two-dimensional phase space, as defined by two parameters each. Note the roughly circular structure of the phase points of the phase space for rate of change of absorbed solar dots represent the other observations). Fig. 3.

Two estimates of the mean dimension of the cloud of phase points are given here, one for lengths of radius ranging from 0.1 * N cells to 0.9 * N cells (long radius, R(q, or \"globaltt dimension), and the second for the range 0.015 * N to 0.15 * N cells dimension (short radius, R,), or \"local\" dimension). In order to avoid strong border effects, the reference points from which the counting procedure start are those phase points whose coordinates lie within range parameters are more closely related than others. The \"global\" and the \"local\" geometry of the cloud of space points is estimated by the dimensions for long (R(Q) and short (R,)) radius lengths. Dimensions of about two will be found for space points which are evenly distributed. The interpretation is that the investigated pair of parameters is not related and that any combination of values is possible. Dimensions somewhere between about one and less than two will be found for space points which are distributed along intersecting lines. The interpretation is that many but not all combinations of a pair of parameters are possible. Dimensions below one will be found for space points which cluster in disjoint patches. The interpretation is that Stationarity Table 2 results of the six different tests of stationarity of the time series and their rate of change which have been performed. The overall ratio of \"failed\" to \"passed\" is 91 to 29. This ratio is biased toward \"failed\" because some of It seems to reasonable rely only on those criteria accepting which been presented above. we conclude that changes are nonstationary for all time series and all derived time series, whether they have been transformed or not (by eliminating the long-lasting anomalies. (ii) the covariances of the transformed time series are generally stationary, the single exception being absorbed solar radiation. The covariances of original time series are for all temperature-related series (SSTM, SSTL, D14), for estimated from 8-year-long records - at least after elimination of the seasonal signal and anomalies. the least parameter seems be is stationary. However, the frequency cases (SSTL) and stationary parameter.

Here the mean increase of variance in of related to special forms CFNP's (Table 3). This type of model was used to qualify the random events which contribute to the temporal structure of the time series. The CFNP is accepted as relevant if it describes more than 113 of the variance of the time series. It was found that no original time series of physical parameters fit the CFNP-concept (Figs. 2A and 2C). However, both VPA-biomass time series do. This is due to the seasonal signal which appears more important in the physical data than in the biomasses.

Overall, CFNP's describe about half of the variance (42%-66%) of the time series and all spectral slopes are significantly different from zero. Consequently, the CFNP's are different from white noise processes which are characterized by a vanishing slope of the variance spectra. The slopes of the different spectra are, due to the wide confidence limits (95% level), not significantly different from each other and from a slope of one. Thus, details on the nature of the CFNP's cannot beyond stating that notation this may lead to slightly different exponents in equation (8). In summary, the main characteristics of parameters describing the thermal structure of the upper layer of the Peruvian upwelling system (SST's and depth of the of CFNP near-brownian nature.

This indicates that spaces are unevenly covered with but subregions some phase spaces are found which are evenly covered by phase points (local dimension near two). For example, the phase space defined by the absorbed solar radiation (Q) and its rate of change (see Fig. 3A) has a global dimension of about 1.35 - 1.40 and a local dimension of about 1.75 - 1.80 (see Fig. 4A).

It is concluded that most surface points of the phase space in the neighborhood of a given phase point of absorbed solar radiation and its go together with different values of the other parameter. These features are expressed by (i) the local geometry of the cloud of phase points - which is roughly a surface and (ii) a global geometry i.e., network of multiple crossing phase lines and voids (forbidden regions). parameter against its rate of change\" in Fig. 4A has a clear main pattern: the global and local dimensions are about 1.0 and 1.8, respectively. These values characterize a phase space which is mainly void on the global scale, but with phase points that are quasi-evenly scattered (local dimension near two) along continuous phase lines (global dimension about one). Different characteristics are found for the phase spaces of the anchoveta is found for phase space is, on the local scale, evenly covered by phase points (local diinension of two). The local geometry of the cloud of phase points corresponds to a surface. Slightly different values of SSTM are compatible with any slightly different value of its rate of change. The highest and lowest global dimensions for the physical parameters are found for the absorbed solar radiation and the turbulence index, respectively. above one) are distributed along multiple crossing phase different level of turbulence (strength and rate of change). The local dimensions of the phase spaces defined by the anchoveta biomasses and their rates of change are relatively small (between 1.10 and 1.45). %is suggests that the local geometry of the cloud of phase points does not correspond to a surface, but to a mixture of forbidden on the biomasses and not all possible. The global dimensions of the phase spaces defined by the anchoveta biomasses are less than one. This describes the global structure, or geometry, of the cloud points as composed of disjunct sub-clouds, each indicating a different level of the anchoveta stock (biomass and its rate of change). The combination of local and global features which distinguish the biological parameter from the physical parameter are most pronounced for the biomass of mature adult anchoveta. It might be suspected that the VPA-algorithm is the cause of this different behavior. This argument may be partly correct, but it fails to explain the very different dimensions found for mature anchoveta and anchoveta recruits. Thus, the small dimensions of the phase spaces defined by the biological time series may not be an artifact. Fig. 4A shows a second ensemble of dimensions, those obtained from parameters which are linked through the data used for their estimation. Most estimates of local and global scatter pairs which have no database (in Fig. 4B). these dimensions measure, however, is the distortion caused either by the mathematical procedure or by the combination of two independent data sources. The individual estimates, as given in Fig. 4A, show: (i) the \"blurring\" of an unequivocal relation on the local scale (local dimension greater than one) and (ii) a disruption of this relation on the global scale (global dimension less than local and than given above are found for turbulence index vs. upwelling index. This is not surprising since both are closely related (via the winds used to compute both) and do not depend on a third parameter. Fig. 4B shows the local vs. global dimensions for phase spaces defined by two independently determined physical (of which an example is shown on Fig. 3B). The local and global dimensions scatter around 1.85 and 1.10, respectively, which is not very different from the dimensions of phase spaces defined considered. 0) local dimensions not statistically different from two are found for the for these parameter combinations, any point of the phase space near a given phase point is a possible phase point, or conversely, there are no voids in the neighborhood of any phase. Global dimensions for these two parameter pairs are about 1.1 and 1.3. Thus, are covered by phase lines separated by voids. It follows from this that small changes of one parameter, e.g., upwelling index, are consistent with any small change of the other parameter, e.g., 14' isotherm depth (D,,). small global dimensions combined with relatively high local dimensions voids, but global consist these two parameter pairs best characterize different physical states (or large changes) of the system as a whole. small local dimensions (about 1.75) and relatively high global dimensions (about 1.75) and relatively small global dimensions (about 1.1) are found for the parameter pairs turbulence index vs. absorbed solar radiation and respectively. The geometry of these clouds of phase points is locally and globally a network of multiple crossing phase by voids. Thus, these pairs of parameters characterize best different physical states (or small changes) on the local scale. The dimensions of the phase for anchoveta vs. or each other vs. physical parameter are shown in Fig. 4C. The main feature of Fig. 4C is that local and global dimensions are mostly above 1.75 or in the range 0.75 1.25, the estimates for single pairs of parameters differ considerably. The local and global dimensions of the phase space defined by the VPA-biomasses of adult, mature anchoveta and of anchoveta recruits are 1.65 and 0.85, respectively (Fig. pattern different disjunct states. Different combinations of on scale, in Indeed, they are more frequent than for all but one pair of physical parameters. However, the combination of the VPA-biomasses on the local scale is not unequivocal and the phase points scatter along multiple crossing phase lines. The dimensions of the clouds of phase points for the parameter pairs VPA-biomass of anchoveta pattern (Fig. 4C). Highest local and global dimensions, 2.0 and 1.2, respectively, are found in conjunction with SSTM. The lowest local and global dimensions, 1.85 and 0.8, respectively, are found in conjunction with the depth of the 14' isotherm. All other combinations have dimensions between these two limits, which cover a considerable range for the global scale (but not for the local scale). Thus, on both the global and on the local scale, VPA-biomasses of anchoveta recruits are related depth of the 14' isotherm than to any other physical parameter. The second best relation is found for the turbulence index. There, the global dimension is below one, indicating that the phase space is composed of different disjunct states. One should remember that both the 14' isotherm depth and index relations this order.. The dimensions of the clouds of phase points for the \"VPA-biomass of mature, local or global dimensions range between 1.75 and 1.95 or 0.6 and 1.1, respwtively. The highest or lowest local dimensions are Thus, is most closely related to offshore Ekman transport if global and local scale are considered. The weakest relation of local and global scales to physical parameters is found for SST*. On the global scale, the relation is closest or weakest for radiation, Considering closest for offshore Ekrnan SOL The results relevant to the problem ecosystem can as: rapidly if the seasonal signal is eliminated from the data. On the average, less than 50% of the variance can be explained when the time lag between the observations exceeds two months. This suggests that random the seasonal cycle. The variance attributable, via spectral analysis, to the seasonal signal, is relatively high only for physical parameters, but does not rise significantly above the variance of the noisy background one parameter absorbed solar Interannual over the seasonal itself. The seasonal signal is the only quasi-periodic contribution to the time series. Quasi-regular contributions on longer time scales, i.e., El Niiio events, were noticed in some time series as a spectral band of high variances. This feature is shown by the anchoveta biomasses, the SOI, the turbulence index and the SST but not by the time series of the depth of the 14' isotherm. This indicates temporal changes in the vertical structure of the upper oceanic layer which differ between single El Nifio events. This is a feature which is corroborated by the observation (J. Mendo, pers. comm.) that the composition of the multispecies fish stock off Peru differs between single El Nifio events. The characteristics of those noise processes which determine parameters turbulence were not the thermal structure layer of the Peruvian upwelling system (SST's and depth of the 14' a CFNP of near-brownian None of the time series can statistically be described as stationary. This implies that the Peruvian upwelling system is unsteady in its major characteristics, at least on medium time scales. An exception to this is recruitment of anchoveta, which shows stationarity with respect to its mean variability (variance), the occurrence of extreme increases of high values. This result suggests an adaptation of the anchoveta to a nonstationary, variable environment. The basic geometry of phase spaces (parameter and its rate of change) of all physical parameters (except the turbulence index) is about the same. The phase points scatter along multiple crossing phase lines separated mainly large scales. A phase spaces is found for the VPA- biomasses and the index. There, the phase points scatter around disjunct phase states and voids are found on all scales. That is, the number of possible combinations of, e.g., anchoveta biomasses and its rate of change, is smaller than combinations of, e.g., for SST and its rate of change. This implies that anchoveta biomasses and turbulence index are more frequently in some distinct phase states than the other parameter. Different states of the physical subsystem of the Peruvian upwelling index are best described by the parameter pairs turbulence 14' isotherm, respectively, if large changes of the system are to be analyzed. For small changes, the pairs of parameters or SOI, respectively. If both large and small changes of the Peruvian upwelling system must be described, then SO1 are suitable, The phase spaces defined by the biomasses of mature, adult anchoveta and of anchoveta recruits have a geometry which, on the global scale, reflects disjunct states. Local scale geometry is that along lines, separated by combinations voids. the two VPA-biomasses is strong if compared with those of most physical parameters. (w On the global and local scales, the biomasses of anchoveta recruits and of mature adults are related most closely to the turbulence index (for both VPA-biomasses) or to the depth of the 14' isotherm the Peruvian upwelling system occurring on time scales longer of more than half a year are, in the mean, a mixture of a seasonal signal and of a nonstationary random process with drifting means and variances. geometry (CFNP). The the (i) multiple disjunct states are most characteristic of the dynamics of the anchoveta VPA-biomasses and (ii) physical parameters, e.g., the turbulence index, were identified which are most closely related to biological changes. These are characterize Nifio, e.g., are consistent with those interpretations which have been developed by only looking at the time series and inferring the basic principles of the underlying dynamics. The theoretical mainly the geometry of the noise processes, proved to be helpful to describe the observations and to understand some principles of the relevant dynamics. The detailed data analyses showed that 30 years of data may be a lower limit for the amount of data needed to describe the Peruvian upwelling system. Thus, efforts should be done to extend other existing, but shorter time series (e.g., on sardine or zooplankton biomasses) to a period of at least 30 years. The main lesson learned is that we can answer the question implied by the title of the book edited and Tsukayama (1987): \"Why three decades of The answer - \"random events determine, to an important degree, the changes of the physical properties of the Peruvian upwelling system\" may restrict our un, A. 1987.

The 20\u00b0C isotherm is, on the other hand, the boundary of relatively nutrient poor oceanic water masses of the outer part of the continental shelf, where the bulk of the mackerel and horse generally these will result in changes of (i) anchoveta concentration, (ii) spatial overlapping of anchoveta predators with their prey, and (iii) mixing of cold, nutrient rich with warm, production satellite images SST during (a) a period when cold waters stretched all along the Peruvian coast, and (b) As an alternative, the present contribution presents derivations of simple, linear SST-based models for estimating (1) the size of the area I 17\u00b0C off Peru, (2) the offshore and alongshore extent of this area and (3) the offshore distance of the 20\u00b0C isotherm, our aim being to provide a tool for modelling purposes, e.g., to estimate the vulnerability of anchoveta. Materials and Methods The areas and offshore/alongshore distances have been estimated by planimetric analysis of maps (1987), oceanographic conditions January-March, been coast the results of the planimetric analyses of 48 temperature maps (Urquizo et al. 1987). Documented are the size of the area I17\"C, its offshore and A-E Table data can be the location of the 17\u00b0C and 20\" isotherms along the Peruvian coast. Fig. 3 presents seasonal means of these parameters for the period 1970-1985. The dynamics of the area of waters 117\u00b0C and the offshore/alongshore extent of the 17\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C are as follows: when the overall coastal sea temperature is high (summer, i.e., January-March), the cold area is located at the center and the south of the Peruvian coast, and has a minimum extent and an offshore The 20\u00b0C similarly comes to the coast about 25 nautical miles offshore. During winter (July-September) most of the Peruvian coastal waters are cold (117\u00b0C); this zone has a mean offshore extent of 60 nautical miles and a total area ca. 50 times that occurring in summer. The 20\u00b0C isotherm is far offshore (over 100 nautical miles). Spring and autumn have characteristics intermediate between those of summer and winter. During the El Nifio of 1982-1983 the normal seasonal pattern was disturbed. There was no cold water area off Peru from spring 1981 to autumn 1983.

We conclude that mean values of SST data referring to the Peruvian coast can be used for estimating the location of the <17OC and 20\u00b0C isotherms, which have been considered as characteristic for (i) the cold coastal upwelling area and (ii) the warmer oceanic waters of the outer half of the that of mackerel and horse mackerel (Zuta et al. 1983). Increases in during Niiio decrease the size of the area 517\u00b0C; and a southward shift of the northern boundary of the cold water area. For purposes of ecosystem modelling, the regressions presented assess the variation of the habitat size of anchoveta and its main predators. Muck et al. (1987) put forward the hypothesis the spatial parameters distance) of the cold and warm water habitats off Peru control - or at least influence - the migration and concentration pattern of anchoveta of mackerel and horse mackerel, resulting, e.g., in changes of anchoveta vulnerability to predation, to egg and larval cannibalism and to the fishery. This hypothesis is supported by Ware and Tsukayama (198 that concentration increases temperature can also to exist (Fig. 4). Mean sea surface temperature along Peruvian coast (OC) Fig. 4.

Analysis of the data in Table 3 shows that the anchoveta distribution area is significantly correlated (P < 0.05; r = 0.42) with the area of water <17\"C, and with anchoveta biomass (B) as well (P < 0.005; r = 0.62). 2.

CFrom Zuta predictions can be by combining three variables into a log- linear model, e.g., into where A is the anchoveta distribution area (in 103 Nm2) off Peru, B the biomass of anchoveta (in t. 106) and C the area of water 117OC (in lo3 Nm2) This model, based on the data of Table 3, has a multiple correlation coefficient R = 0.794 and explains 62.1% of the variance in the data set. Both of its partial slope are significantly different from zero (P < 0.01; d.f. 23). As an alternative, one can replace the variable (C) in equation (1) by the SST values from which the C-values were computed (see (R2 = 0.608) and where both slopes are significant (P < 0.01), and which applies, as did equation (2), to the stretch of the Peruvian coast between 4' and 14\"s. The good fit of these models to the available data validates the concept of a Main Anchoveta Area (MAR), first proposed and used as a constant by Muck and Sinchez (1987), and now shown to be an SST-dependent variable. The interrelationships between SST, anchoveta concentration and the spatial characteristics of habitat imply an increase of anchoveta mortality by predators and the fishery when the distribution area of mackerel and horse mackerel overlaps with that of anchoveta (Muck and Sanchez 1987), especially during El Niiio events. This is also a time when the anchoveta schools are concentrated close to the coast and hence highly vulnerable to the purse seiner fleet. Valdivia that during the El event of 1971-1972 anchoveta were so concentrated that 170,000 t of them were caught in a single day, in March 1972 (see also Csirke, this vol.). When an El Niiio event, however, becomes so strong that the cold waters completely disappear (as is nearly the case in Fig. 1 lower panel), anchoveta vulnerability to the fishery fleet abruptly drops to of the pelagic schools out of the purse seiners' range. This and Vilchez (1986). Changes in the water habitat also influence anchoveta recruitment. Csirke (1980)i who added model of Ricker (1954) an \"anchoveta concentration index\", found that an stock during spawning in in a density-dependent egg and larvae cannibalism.

Abstract The hypothesis that the poleward propagation of El Niiio events along the coast of South Ameriq is due to Kelvin waves lacks stringent confirmation by observation. Observations are discussed which refute Kelvin wave model. An alternative concept of poleward propagating shock waves is proposed. Same of its basic features and advantages are discussed. Resumen La hipotesis que la propagacih de 10s fenomenos de El Nio a lo largo de la costa de America del Sur es debido a las \"ondas de Kelvin\" adolece de una confirmacick concluyente por medio de mediciones. Las observaciones que refutan el modelo des \"ondas de Kelvin\" estan discutidas. Un concept0 altemativo de propagacih de 'bnda shock\" es propuesto. Se discute algunas de sus caracteristicas bisicas y ventajas. Introduction Southern oscillation events are linked to equatorial Kelvin waves crossing the Pacific towards South America (see, e.g., Cane 1983; Kase 1985). The current system creates Kelvin waves by shear instability (Philander et al. 1985). The South American coast acts as wave guide for Kelvin waves of about 5 to 10 days period, more than 1,000 km wave length and 2.5 ms-1 phase velocity (Romea and Smith 1983). Equatorial Kelvin waves, incident on the South American coast, give rise to coastal Kelvin waves propagating poleward (Anderson and southern oscillation events propagate poleward along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru with phase velocities similar to those of coastal Kelvin waves (Smith 1983). The problem to be considered here is: are the dynamics of the southward propagating El Niiio events those of a Kelvin wave as suggested by Cane (1983)? The Kelvin wave hypothesis provides of speed of propagation together, indicate that the Kelvin wave hypothesis may be too restrictive and should be replaced by a more general concept. Theoretical Considerations A Kelvin wave has several main features which do not depend on the technique used to derive the solutions from the governing current amplitude u decreases y (x is the alongshore distance, t the time). If H is the vertical displacement of the isotherms, then the proportionality holds. The alongshore propagation of the wave is like a gravity wave, thus there is a proportionality such as The phase speed of the Kelvin wave is nondispersive. Thus its propagation speed is independent of wave frequency. Therefore, a general-wave like solution of (1) and (2) may be obtained by: u (x, y, t) =U (y) * F (x - ct) H (x, y, t) = H (y) * F (x - ct), where c is the phase speed and x - ct the phase (abbreviated below as s). From (3) and (2) follow the proportionalities: H (y) and U (y) differ by a constant factor, and, using (I), are exponentially decreasing with increasing offshore distance. The constant 1 can be identified as the Rossby radius of deformation (Krauss 1973). Data off Peru to test these main characteristics of currents and isopycnal depths (equations (I), (2), or to the authors' knowledge, not yet available. Thus, the Kelvin wave character of the motion is still hypothetical. However, the data from which Brainard and the proportionality equation (6), which equation (1) (2), If this proportionality holds and if likewise the nondispersive character of the phase speed is shown, then the linear Kelvin wave character of the El Niiio events along the coasts of Peru could be demonstrated. The linearity of the motion is implicit due to the form of equation (3). The linearity of the wave may be questioned. The poleward of the earth rotation causes increasing of the wave energy against the shoreline. The Rossby radius decreases by a factor of two from &her 2.5's to or of mean current amplitude up not balanced which do not agree with the notion of one long, linear Kelvin wave propagating along the coast. a) Posner (1957) reported that the 1953 El Niiio advanced twice and retreated twice during the observation period from 10 March to 21 May 1953. Wooster and GuillCn (1974) reported for described El Nifio event linked to a rapid, stepwise increase of 1) in 100 m depth: \"the alongshore current, averaged over 1,8, and 64 days before 7 October, was poleward at 18.9, October, and averaged over following 8 and 64 days remained poleward at 30.1 and 25.3 cds.\" Temperature (see his Fig. 2) increased steplike, first in small (from early October in large steps. Furthermore, strong temperature were found in different depths (Knoll et al. 1987: p. 33 - end of March 1983, p. 113 - October 1982, p. 117 - April and May 1983) which neither occurred in phase nor had smooth forefronts. Both features are not consistent with a Kelvin wave dynamic. The sea level changes at Santa Cruz and Callao in 1982 and 1983 were fluctuating stepwise, as shown by Cane (1983). Single steps may to of a monotone mean stepping function would probably be more appropriate (Fig. 2). I I days - 8 0 8 days 0 30 678 13 date September October Fig. 1.

La li'nea superimpuesta es una sugestiva aproximoci6n de pasos en contraste intermittence. These are features which do not match simple wave dynamics. Furthermore, a stringent confirmation of the Kelvin it seems reasonable to suggest that the dynamic features of the El NSo events off Peru should be reanalyzed. Of special importance is the question whether the polewad propagating motion is a single or a composed signal and how linear the event is. The A possible dynamic concept, including the Kelvin wave concept to a certain degree, is implied in the nonlinear only concept of shock waves itself needs to be discussed here. The model predicts that these shock waves will more rapidly than a KeIvin wave downstream from the front. An upstream Kelvin wave will catch up with the front. Thus, the front does nut disintegrate in alongshore direction and be source. The alongshore penetration length of single shock wave depend on relative strength of the shack itself dissipation or dispersion. The generation of poleward propagating shock waves may be due to the observed pulsation of the Equatorial Current System (Lukas 1986). EL Niiio signals may be caused by these pulses the of the isopycnals occurring east of the Galapagos Islands in early autumn and spring (Lukas 1986). The sequence of shock waves, eventually followed up by Kelvin waves, may serve as a conceptual model. Each El Niiio event can be assumed to be built by a particular sequence of shock waves. This would explain both the intermittence and the characteristics of particular El Niiio events. Furthermore, the shock wave observed of concept suggest that a free superposition of different motions may not be possible.

The new production time series was converted to primary production using the \"f' ratio, 0.75 for the coast of Peru. The estimates of primary production were in new production generally followed the expected pattern, with lower new production during El Nio and higher new production during cool years.

Introduction The southeastern tropical Pacific produces proportion the global pelagic fish harvest (FA0 1983). The richness of living resources is a consequence of high levels of primary production which result concentrations of tropical setting (Ryther 1969; Cushing 1971). Primary production in the ocean, however, is highly variable in space and time (Steele 1977). On the other hand, temporal and spatial observations of primary productivity in the ocean are relatively few. Because of the high *Present address: Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, 160 Central Ave., Pacific Grove, California 93950, USA. variability in primary productivity in space and time and the few direct observations of primary productivity, approach involves using upwelling models is primarily supported by upwelling which below the thermocline (Dugdale and Goering 1967). The potential new production of a region is therefore determined by the amount of nitrate upwelled into the euphotic zone. An estimate of the potential new production can be made by estimating the nitrate concentration of the upwelled water and estimating the volume of water upwelled. Wyrtki (1963) estimated the volume of water upwelled for a region in the southeastern tropical Pacific from 6's to 24\"s to be 1.0 x 1014 m3/year. Using the Wyrtki (1963) estimate of the volume of upwelled and assuming a nitrate concentration of 25 pg-at.11 in the source water, a potential new production of 2.0 x 1014 gC/year was estimated (Chavez and Barber 1987). The calculation assumes upwelled is a Redfield ratio conversion of nitrogen to carbon. As part of a multidisciplinary effort designed to study the variability of living resources along the coast of Peru, long time series of monthly averages of physical and biological parameters have been compiled (Pauly and Tsukayama 1987). The spatial domain over which the multidisciplinary effort concentrates is the region along the coast of Peru from 4's to 14's. The temporal domain is from 1953 to 1982 and in some cases until 1985. Following a logic similar to that outlined below for the Wyrtki (1963) estimate of upwelling (Fig. 1) we have taken the upwelling series compiled by Bakun time series compiled by Brainard and McLain (1987) as part of the multidisciplinary study and converted them to a time series of new primary production (sensu Dugdale and Goering 1967).

Materials and Met Barber and Smith (1981) have estimated that water upwelled along the coast of Peru comes from between 50 and 75 m, therefore the nitrate concentration at 60 m is a good proxy for the nitrate concentration of the upwelled water. During the period 1982-1984 the nitrate concentration at 60 m at Paita, Peru (5's) was found to be a function of sea level and thermocline depth (Fig. 2). Long time series of nutrient concentrations for the coast of Peru do not exist; however, a long monthly time series of thermocline of isotherm) has been compiled by Brainard and McLain (1987) from the US Navy Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center (FNOC) Master Oceanographic Observations concentration of nitrate in the upwelled source water can be estimated by finding a relationship between the depth of the 14' isotherm (a proxy for the depth of the thermocline) and the nitrate concentration 1983, a significant relationship between the depth of Fig. 2.

Using this equation, the long monthly time series of the was converted of nitrate at 60 m. There are several factors which have not been considered in the present analysis and could potentially bias the calculations. No correction is applied has a similar effect on new primary production as El Niiio: it reduces the concentration excluded from regression between nitrate 60 m and the depth of the 14OC isotherm. In addition shortly after the and abnormal remained to the coast. These stations also were not considered in the present analysis. The second parameter needed to estimate potential new production is the amount of water upwelled. A long time series (1953-1984) of monthly upwelling are calculated from maritime measurements of wind speed and direction (Bakun et al. 1974) and fie units are m3/sec/m of coast. To see how the volume of upwelling calculated from the upwelling rate compared to other estimates of the volume of water upwelled along the coast of Peru (Wyrtki 1963) we estimated the mean volume of water upwelled for the stretch of coast from 4' to 14OS using the upwelling rates. volume of water upwelled for the length of the coast (4's to 14's) for the period from 1953 to 1984 is 7.6 x 1013 rn3lyea.r. The volume calculated here is very similar to that estimated by Wyrtki (1963) using geostrophy, supporting which depend solely on the wind (Bakun 1987) is that there are times when upwelling favorable winds along the coast of Peru produce no upwelling (Huyer et al. 1987). This happens at and perhaps during summer months. Following the logic outlined in Fig. 1, the long time series of nitrate concentration and upwelling rate coupled with nitrogen to carbon were used to construct a long time series of potential new production. Since the theoretical offshore dimension of coastal upwelling is the Rossby radius deformation (Yoshida 1967) an estimate of the area affected by coastal upwelling between 4's and 14's can be made. Taking the total productivity of the length of the coastline and dividing by the area we converted the production into daily or yearly rates per m2 so that comparisons to productivities measured techniques could be 1). thermocline depth time series was incomplete so that smoothing and time series analysis could not be easily performed. In order to fill in the gaps we searched for relationships between thermocline depth and other variables, A multiple regression using the mean Peru SST and an index of Oscillation and McLain 1987) gave a 0.001). thermocline depths were found using the multiple regression equation. With the complete series we were able to smooth the data in order to suppress the annual cycle, using a 13-month to higher frequency variability, time series analysis was performed on the long monthly time series. In order to determine seasonal cycles in the time series the long- term means individual months were calculated. Trend analysis was also performed on the time series data in order to investigate long-term trends of the data. Spectral analysis was used identify the important frequencies of time series. Results The grand mean concentration of nitrate at 60 m for the entire time series is 22.21 pM. This together with the mean upwelling rate converts to a mean potential new production of 844 gC/Wyear. Chavez and Barber (1987) have estimated a mean total production of 834 gC/m2/year for 1983,1984, and 1985 using C- 14 carbon uptake experiments. Others (Walsh 1975,1981; Cowles et. al. 1977; Shushkina et. al. 1978; Barber and Smith 1981; Chavez and Barber 1985; and Barber et. al. 1986) have also estimated total primary production for the Peruvian upwelling system. In order to compare the new production estimates to total production estimates it is necessary to convert new production to total production. Although new production is a fraction of total production, for the coast of Peru this fraction is high and has been estimated as 0.75 (Dugdale 1985). Using Dugdale's (1985) estimate of the \"f' factor (the ratio of new to total production) for the Peruvian upwelling system, the potential new production was converted to total production. Comparison of estimates made in this paper to estimates made C-14 uptake (Table 1) shows the estimates using the physical data and those from C-14 measurements are very similar. There is then good agreement between the estimates from the physical data sets and those from C- 14 uptake experiments. Table 1.

From 1956 through 1961 the depth of the 140 isotherm remained relatively constant at about 120 m. the 14' isotherm during El Niiio ranged from 120 m in 1957 to 160 m in 1983. The average depth of the 14' isotherm during non-El Niiio years is about 100 m. The nitrate concentration at 60 m, a mirror image of the depth of the 14' C isotherm, has minima during the El Niiio years (Fig. 4). The lowest value occurred in 1983 where the concentration of nitrate about 13 pM. The highest concentration of nitrate occurred in 1971 at 27 pM. Just like the depth of the 14' isotherm, the nitrate concentration data had a relatively constant value of about 21 uM between 1956 and 1961. The time series of the rate of upwelling showed peaks during El Niiio years (Fig. 5) supporting the observations of Enfield (198 1) who first suggested that average upwelling about 2.0 m3/sec/m of coast. The lowest rate being about 1.5 m3/sec/m of coast occurred in 1959 and the strongest rate of 3 m3/sec/m of coast occurred in 1983. The range of upwelling rate during El Niiio years is from 2 to 3 m3/sec/m of coast occurring in 1969 and 1983, respectively. The time series of new production (Fig. 6) shows that production is lower than the mean during El Niiio years except during part of 1957 when the production was about 2.6 gC/mz/day. During the other El Niiio years, the production ranged from 1.7 gC/rnz/day in 1983 to about 2.2 Year Fig. 3. Time series of the depth of the 14O isotherm (m).

Spectral Analysis The annual cycle of the thermocline depth in the eastern tropical Pacific is apparently driven by remote annual changes in the trade it is the important periodicities are annual and semi-annual (Myers 1979). The power spectrum for the depth of the 14' isotherm (Fig. 10) has strong at months and decomposed deepenings (Chavez 1987a). The variation in the depth of the thermocline along the coast of Peru may be a result of local (see below) and remote wind forcing. The power spectrum of the upwelling rate (Fig. 11) has strong signals at 12 and 6 months. The existence cycle related to the large-scale annual variations of the southeast trade wind field (Goldberg and O'Brien 1981). The power spectrum of new production is very similar to the power spectrum of the upwelling rate (Fig. 12). 10' 125 30 7 2 Period (months) Fig. 10. Spectral analysis of the depth cycles. Fig. 10.

Trends The trend line equation for the depth isotherm 0.05T. on (T) gave a regression coefficient of r = 0.26; this was significant (P < 0.01) suggesting that over the course of the thirty-year period covered here the thermocline depth had progressively deepened. A similar trend analysis was performed on the Southern Oscillation index. The Southern Oscillation significant lower the thermocline may be a result of the weakening of the pressure gradient which is believed responsible for maintaining the cross basin tilt in the thermocline (Wyrtki 1975). lo5 I I I I Fig. 12.

The trend line equation for the rate of was 1.80 0.28; this was also significant at the P < 0.01 level. Since upwelling along the coast of Peru is directly related to wind speed the long-term trend is for stronger winds and stronger upwelling. These findings support the observations of Whysall et al. (1987) who found a long-term trend of increasing winds in the eastern and central Pacific. Again this appears related to changes in the Southern Oscillation. New production had a trend line equation of 2,134 + 0.7 1T (in months). The new production data were regressed on time and the resulting correlation coefficient was r = 0.09, which was not significant (P < 0.05). The trend analysis shows that during the course of thirty years the depth of the 14' isotherm and the upwelling rate increased with time, while new production remained constant over this same period. The trends in thermocline and a larger volume of water is upwelled. Discussion Potential new production depends on the and on two properties tend to be coupled temporally along the coast of Peru. They vary in such a manner that variations in the to euphotic zone, and therefore potential new production, are minimized. When thermocline is deep, such as during El Niiio, upwelling is and physical basis for these observations. When the thermocline thermocline (see Cane 1983 for a review of the physical nature of El Niiio). During periods of warmer SST scenario can be of the Southern Oscillation. The long- term (thirty-year) trend in the Southern Oscillation the thermocline depth is for a and stronger the logic of Enfield (1981). It is important to note that others (e.g., Rasmusson 1987) do not find a similar trend in the Southern Oscillation and have suggested that the trends in the wind data (Whysall et al. 1987) may be a result of changes in the methods of measuring winds. The trend in the depth of the thermocline, the measurement of which appears free of systematic sampling artifacts, supports the trend in the coastal winds. The level of new production supported by upwelling along the coast of Peru has thus remained relatively over questions regarding the size of the area over which the new production is realized. The area calculated using the Rossby radius is the spatial domain of vertical motion or upwelling. Stronger winds and greater offshore advection should increase the over which the new is realized. Thus, although a similar quantity of nitrate intensity (per m2) of primary production. trend and the El Niiio condition result in therefore Similarly the upwelling the which are most efficiently converted to fish production (Ryther 1969) so the would be for less efficient conversion of primary production into production. the abundance dinoflagellates would lower ecosystem, 1953 to 1984 (in gC * yeail * 10-12).

With the more accurate monthly estimates of primary production in Table 2 it is now possible to determine the proportion of pri- mary production which was converted into anchoveta production for the entire time series. To estimate production of anchoveta (P), we have multiplied the monthly anchoveta biomass (B, wet weight) estimates of et al. (1987) their estimates of total mortality (2 = fishing mortality + natural mortality from all causes), and estimated production as P = Z * B (Allen 197 1). These estimates were then turned into carbon production estimates, using as conversion factor the average of Ryther's (10) Gushing's (17.85) factor of carbon to wet weight (0.072gC = 1 g ww). The percentage that this represents of the total production is plotted in Fig. 13. This suggests that during the periods of maximum anchoveta biomasses, 2-3% of the total primary production was converted to anchoveta production. Assuming that the gross food conversion efficiency of anchoveta is between 10 and 20% (Walsh 1981), the 2-3% converted to anchoveta flesh would correspond to between 10 30% of However, this range which would have applied during the period of maximum anchoveta abundance (in the 1960s) is realistic only if anchoveta fed exclusively on phytoplankton (which is not the case, see Rojas de Mendiola, this vol., Alamo, this vol. and Pauly et al., this vol.). Walsh (1981) suggested that the changes in anchoveta biomass which occurred early in the the changes in the carbon flow from primary production to anchoveta production do not appear to be of sufficient magnitude to support this hypothesis which was also rejected by Henrichs and Farrington (1984), based on the notable differences in the sediment organic carbon deposition K.R. 1971.

Abstract Different models of upwelling nitrate flux the of primary can be obtained only if the selected model incorporates a realistic gradient of nitrate concentrations, a variable upwelling depth and a variable width of the upwelling area along the Pemvian coast. Model outputs, i.e., monthly estimates of primary production for the period 1953 to 1982 are provided in tabular form for different parameterizations. Resumen Diferentes modelos para la surgencia de flujos de nitratos a lo largo de la costa peruana son derivados y comparados. Se encontm que estimaciones realistas de flujo de nitratos, y a partir de este de la de nueva producci6n primaria, pueden ser obtenidas solamente si el modelo seleccionado incorpora un gradiente realista de concentraciones de nitratos, una profundidad variable de surgencia y una anchura variable del area de surgencia a lo largo de la costa.

The primary production in the upwelling to fluctuate widely. Estimates vary more e.g., GuillCn and Calienes 1981; Feldman measurements are available. Physical data recently made available by Pauly based on wind data and some ancillary data, Chavez et al. (this vol.) derived time series of the potential new production of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem, with a mean of about 3.2 gC m-2 day-1. Here we compare three models and two of physical parameters used to compute the upwelling nitrate in coastal and oceanic zones off Peru. The approach of Chavez et al. (this vol.) shall herein be referred to as Model I. Data The physical data used are time series of monthly mean of upwelling been calculated from wind measurements at Trujillo (8's) on the Peruvian shore (Mendo et al. 1987) and ship measurements in Peruvian coastal waters from 4O-14.OS (Bakun and this vol.). Local spatially averaged are given by by Brainard and McLain (1987) for coastal Peruvian waters. The chemical data are of nitrate primary proportional to the upwelled water mass and the concentration of nitrate. The first step in modelling new primary is in depths of the Peruvian coastal current system is the source of the upwelled water masses. Their actual upwelling to the wind (GuillCn and Calienes 198 1). Model I relies on the correlation of the depth measure concentration of the upwelled water masses. The product of the upwelling index, basically the square of the wind speed, and isotherm depth would thus be a measure of the which may then be converted into an estimate of new primary production. Our model of the vertical nitrate flux differs in three elements from above the changes with depth; the water upwelled to the surface originate from different depths depending on the actual wind speed. Third, the width of the upwelling region, measured by the internal Rossby radius described in contrast to I, to a measure of the vertical nitrate flux which is proportional to the third power of the ratio of wind speed and depths of the 14OC isotherm divided by the surface concentration of nitrate (pM) at 60 m depth is, in Model I, linearly correlated with the depth of the 14OC isotherm (\"DI4\"). a = 44.15 pM and b = 0.20 pMm-I and r = -0.82..

Its thickness \"DE' can be estimated as a function of the (U) water with The vertical flux of nitrate per unit length of the coast line can be compared to equation (2): The internal Rossby radius \"Ri\", the measure of width of the upwelling zone, can be estimated using different approaches, depending on the physics to be described. Here we use a formula which assumes two-layered stratification: a warmer upper layer of surface down to the depth of the 14'C isotherm, and a colder thickness \"h2\" extending from the 14OC isotherm, down to the bottom. The interface is described by its depth @,,) and a normalized mean \"e\" which is a function of the temperatures of the top and the bottom layers. The first is understood as a function of SST and the on salinity changes are not of data. The temperature and salinity ranges found offshore of Peru (Guillen as El Niiio events: = E g = (ms-2) and f = 2.283 * (rad s-1; at 10's) The mean reference bottom depth of 250 has been chosen as reference value for the entire region to which applied. This value fits the nearshore (shelf) conditions but offshore conditions over the continental slope. Some comments on the Rossby radius should be made. It is a measure of the width of the coastal upwelling zone, i.e., there is an exponential decrease of the upwelling to 25% over distances of the order of one Rossby radius. Estimates of the Rossby radius based on equation (9) are most sensitive to changes of the interface depth if the reference bottom depth is about twice the interface depth. reference depth times the then estimates of the Rossby radius of deformation are not too sensitive to different values for the reference bottom depth. Here, the seasonal fluctuations of the Rossby radius as a function of changing stratification is the feature to be ~arameterized. Thus. the ~ararneterization of the Rossbv is set mirror temperature-aependant changes d strakication. . A constant estimate of from the phase speed (about 2.5 ms-1) of internal Kelvin waves (Romea and Smith 1983) has been used in Model I. Estimates of average Rossby radius for regions of large latitudinal extent in low latitudes, as in this case, must be very approximate. The Rossby radius in 5' and 15's is about 220 krn and 73 km, respectively, if derived from the internal phase speed of Kelvin waves. These estimates are several times higher than those which will be used here (Fig. 2), because they rely on a dynamic (Kelvin wave) which is sensitive to the abyssal depths off the continental margin. This would be meaningful if the coastal upwelling is due to Kelvin waves and not due to deep divergence of the Peruvian coastal current system and to Ekman pumping. However, in view of the latitudinal dependence Rossby radius, any useful parameterization should be such that it is not too sensitive to the mean value of the Rossby radius, but rather responds to its temporal, especially setisonal, changes (Fig. Fig. 2 Time series of the mean Rossby radius of deformation for the area 4-14\"s off Peru, as estimated with local SST and deph of the 14\u00b0C isotherm.

Upwelling decreases from the coastline. The latter in this context, the isobath for which the surface wave field is not yet influenced by the bottom topography (this starts at about 50 m), or the isobath separates roughly the nonhydrostatic inshore dynamics. The strength of the upwelling will be about 5% of its maximum value, which occurs at the coast line, at positions three times the Rossby radius seaward of the coast line. The strength of the upwelling is measured by the upwelling index which gives the mass flux by unit length of coast line. Thus, the nitrate flux per unit surface will be obtained for both models of the nitrate flux per unit coast line (equations 2 and 8) The estimates of nitrate flux per unit surface depends (1) the model of the nitrate concentration at depth and (2) the parameterization of the upwelling. The version of our model following most closely that in Model I is characterized by homogeneous nitrate concentration and a fixed upwelling depth. model be called here the \"constant depth model\" or \"CDM\". Our complete model includes which increases with depth and a variable depth from which the water is upwelled by Ekrnan pumping. model will be model\" \"VDM\". Both models are used together with an upwelling zone of variable width (three Rossby radii), thus incorporating upwelling region. The three models thus form a hierarchy of models of increasing complexity (Model I < CDM < VDM). Results and Discussion In the following, the of the vertical nitrate fluxes are compared, and differences due to the use of two distinct descriptions of the wind field will be presented. In a second step, we convert the nitrate fluxes to the new primary production of organic carbon by the Redfield ratio and a global efficiency factor of 0.75. These estimates are then compared to independently obtained measurements of primary In order to compare correctly, one has to consider (1) that isotherm square of the correlation coefficients is about 0.5, thus only 50% of the variance is explained), and (2) that the model to any preselected conditions. Therefore, even if we trust the model expect to find close agreement to of the model outputs should be consistent with observations. The time concentrations were estimated by regression (equation 3) from the time series of the spatial mean SST and local SST (mean of values off Talara, Chimbote and Callao). Fig. 3, which shows their long periodic variability (twelve-monthly running mean), implies that the coast (<=60 km offshore) is stronger than in the oceanic zone nitrate in the coastal and in the oceanic zone appear to have increased since the late 1960s. This feature is due to the different behavior of the time series of local and mean SST since the late 1960s (see Brainard and McLain (60 km offshore \\ (coastal zone 1 (oceanic zone) IILIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 Year Fig. 3.

This result justifies the use of two different sets of upwelling indexes, one for the coast (Trujillo upwelling) and one for the oceanic zone (Bakun's upwelling), to describe the vertical fluxes. Therefore, both models will be applied to two determined setting (SST to NO3, Bakun's In both cases, the same estimates of the Rossby radius (Fig. 2) have been used. It should be noted that most of the variability of the Rossby radius due to seasonal fluctuations; seasonal roughly 1.5; and minimum and maximum values are about 20 km and 30 km, respectively. This means that the width of the upwelling zone (equation 9) varies between 60 and 90 km. This seems to be a reasonable esti- mate if compared to observations of the width of the coastal zone of high productivity (Calienes et al. 1985) or low SST (Zuta et al. 1978). Also, the seasonal variability of radius and OCEANIC COASTAL and central centro: mensuales de nitratm frente a1 Perk, obtenido del \"modelo a profundidad constante\" constant upwelling depth model (CDM) are obtained for situations of high nitrate fluxes and this feature is independent of the use coastal or oceanic parameter setting.

Thus, depth and variable upwelling are included in differences lower estimates of for southern hemisphere summer. Calienes al.

This seems to be closer to the range given by the VDM, but the CDM does not fall off significantly. Seasonal variability is slightly for parameter setting. running mean) of the nitrate fluxes per unit surface (Fig. 5) show that both models give the same estimate also applies to our estimates of new primary nothing more than re- scaled of nitrate flux (see Fig. 5). The mean values of both models could have been tuned to match each other by, e.g., plugging a higher constant \"c\" in the parameterization of the depth from which the water is taken by Ekman pumping. However, this would only mask the systematic differences between both models. Fig. 5 also shows the net effects of the setting. However, the differences are about 1 gCm-rzd-1, which is within the range of differences between the two models. The sequence of peak and troughs in the time series differ, especially for the 1960s. This indicates, if both near- offshore. This, too, appears consistent with the spatial variability of the physics of the Peruvian upwelling system (Brink et al. 1983). GuillCn et al. (1977) report a ratio of primary production between \"normal\" and the 1972 El Niiio event of about 4 to 1. This ratio is higher than any modeled peak to trough ratio found for the smoothed time series but could be met by the peak to trough ratios of the unsmoothed monthly values.

Any good approximation of the measurements by the model should yield a scatter of points about a line with slope one.

The slopes are different from slope zero at the 80% confidence level. However, care should be taken for any statistical interpretation because the number of points is low. It seems that both models underestimate high productivities and overestimate low productivities. This effect is stronger for the CDM, which as in Model I, incorporates the idea of a constant upwelling depth along with a variable width of the upwelling region. It is concluded that both variable upwelling depths and variable width of the upwelling zone are important features which are needed here. occurring April and June 1969 as well as outside the range of described reasonably well by the models. Two events resulting in low production were overestimated and one event in high production was underestimated. Third, the model incorporating a variable width of the upwelling zone and a fixed upwelling depth overestimates primary production by about 1 gCm-2 is high or low. The median values (Table 1) of both models differ by about 1.6 gCm-2 d-1. This difference is too the regression suggests of monthly new production as Tables 2 to 5 should be used with the foregoing in mind.

An error has been discovered in the computer program used to generate one of the reported series, that of the alongshore component of wind stress on the sea surface. Here we present corrected values for that particular series and also update the series through 1986 (Table 1). Alongshore wind stress is one of the most important forcing functions for dynamic processes in the coastal environment. For periods of variation longer than a half-pendulum day (2.9 actual days at lo0 latitude), the offshore transport which is directly driven by the wind (the offshore Ekman transport) is directly proportional to stress, the constant of proportionality (-3.95 x 104 sec. for the latitude range of this particular series) being the reciprocal of the Coriolis parameter. To the extent that the flow divergence at the coast due to offshore surface transport is not balanced by convergence of water transported offshore of an index\", has been found to correlate 1) are those outlined by Bakun (1987), except that the data for 1985-86 is from the COADS dataset rather per square meter per second across each meter width.

For the Peruvian coast a compass direction of 332' ($ = 28') is chosen as the characteristic large scale coastline trend (i.e, a 0.8829, 0.4695). also erroneously assigned to P. Since the wind stress off Peru is generally from the southwest (Bakun and Parrish 1982), zx would generally have a negative value. Thus the magnitude of the monthly estimate of would tend to have been amplified by the error. The computation of the onshore component of the wind stress and of the \"wind cubed\" index (Bakun 1987) are unaffected by this error. Thus the power spectra of the \"old series from generally has values than the \"new\" corrected series (Fig. la). that the shape of the spectra are quite similar, with high peaks at the annual frequency and the familiar \"red noise\" spectral shape at the low frequency end. Note also that the coherence (Fig. lb) between the series is very high, being nearly 1.0 over the spectral peaks and falling somewhat lower only in spectral \"gaps\" where very little of the variance of the series is found. Also there is essentially no phase difference between the two series over the entire spectral range (Fig. lc). Fig. 1 shows that the two series should be nearly equivalent for most applications, except in terms of magnitude. -- --- 0.6 I ;#: Old series - I !

Both series indicate seasonal maxima in alongshore stress during austral winter September) and minima in summer (lowest in January). Both series show increases in alongshore stress associated with El Niiio episodes and some indication of a general linear upward trend from the mid-1950s to 1982-83.

The regression line directly intersects the origin (intercept = 0.00) in all three cases. Bohle-Carbonell (this volume), in examining the fractal dimensions of related to fisheries, uses the Bakun (1987) series. As discussed in Mendelssohn (this vol.), there is a close relationship between fractal dimension and fractal differencing fractional parameter d are determined from of and theoretical spectrum. As the \"old\" and \"new\" series have similar spectra, there should be little change in these estimates, and the use of the \"new\" series should the \"old series is d = 2212, while for the \"new\" series it is d = .2857, see Mendelssohn (this vol.) for details). Cury and Roy (1989) estimate optimal environmental windows for the Peruvian anchoveta, as well as for species from other eastern boundary current regions, using a turbulence index (wind speed cubed) as the environmental variable. Their study is unaffected by this correction, as they use the Trujillo series of Mendo et al. (1987). It is expected that other studies that may have used the earlier series will be similarly unaffected to any substantial degree. as maritime obsewations. 1953-84, p. 46-74. In D.

Introduction This contribution presents a time series, covering the years 1964 to 1987, of zooplankton volumes off Peru and attempts to identify some of the causes for the observed changes. During the initial period two mild El-Niiio events occurred (1965, 1969); thus, one may use this period as reference for the general pattern of zooplankton distribution off Peru. Subsequent El Niiio 1982-1983, altered this pattern and reduced overall 1988). The present contribution provides previously unpublished background material on these changes. basic material consists of 6,658 samples collected during research and survey cruises of the Eureka type, carried out by IMARPE from 1964 to 1987. Samples were obtained from vertical hauls between a depth of 50 m and the sea surface, using a Hensen net of 0.33 m2 mouth area and 300 p mesh, and then fixed in 10% formaldehyde buffered zooplankton analyses. Then the fish eggs and larvae were set aside and the volume remaining zooplankters was determined using the displacement method 1972). All values are expressed in ml/m3. The sampling area (Fig. 1) covers the Peruvian coastline from 3O30'S to 18O30'S, and up to 170 krn off the coast. Considering the characteristics of its fish populations and its oceanographic attributes, the Peruvian Coast has shelf is observed, and with an upwelling area north of 090 S and another off Callao (120 S). The country's main pelagic fisheries are localized data collection was not volumes obtained have been averaged by (January-March), autumn (April-June), winter (July-September) and spring (October-December).

La entenrrdn hacia fuera de la costa del cfrea de muestreo es cerca de 170 krn en promedio. Results and Discussion The zooplankton volumes, averaged by season, are presented in Table 1. In general, it can be seen that the volumes are higher during spring (see Fig. 2). Comparatively, Area highest zooplankton volumes, a the influence which carries zooplanktonic organisms than the cold water of the coastal current. The other matter to highlight with regard to these series is the notable reduction of the zooplankton volumes along the Peruvian coast, very evident since the El Niiio event of 1972- 1973. Volumes for the period 1972-1987 represent, on the average, around 30-40% of those observed for previous years (Fig. 3). Carrasco and Santander (1988) pointed out that during the 1983 El Niiio and for the area of 060-120S, copepod abundance decreased to 116 with respect to 1977 and 1981, and that generally, zooplankton volumes decreased drastically.

This applies in particular to the first larval stages following the 197 1; Hunter 1972). The aim of this study is to identify the food niches and gut well through the comparison of morphological parameters. This study follows up the behavior of E. ringens larvae by Rojas de Mendiola (1974, 1980) and Ware et al. (198 1). As sardine and anchoveta have widely overlapping distribution areas off Peru, the results will be discussed with respect to food competition and to environmental changes such as caused Methods Larvae were sampled during day and night at 45 along the Peruvian coast (18O04'S to 3'23's) during February and March 1982 by vertical of a Hensen net ethanol (70%) and later analyzed at the Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE) with respect to (i) standard length, gut length, mouth width, (ii) eye was assumed to be functional either when it was found open, or when it could straightforwardly be teased open.

These findings agree with the available data on mouth and eye function in Fig. 1 show curves obtained by grouping 1,077 anchoveta larvae ranging 5 mm and 106 sardine larvae ranging from 3.5 to 5 mm into six size classes of 0.5 mm width. For both species, there is a close linkage between eye and mouth functions: larvae with completely pig- open mouth. This development starts for anchoveta at around 2.7 mm, and is completed at a length of ca. 4 mm. In sardine, this development starts below 4 mm and is completed with 5 mm. Table 1.

In contrast to anchoveta, sardine spawn relatively far offshore (35-70 km off the Peruvian coast, see Santander and de Castillo 1977) where zooplankton is more abundant than inshore (Walsh et al. 1980). Even where both co-occurred for a given size class, larvae had phytoplankton larvae. first-feeding anchoveta and sardine larvae, their survival (Guillen and Guillen 1983) or when there is a southward displacement of the spawning stock to less productive areas (Walsh 1978; Walsh et al. 1980). Spawning in the sardine appears to occur earlier during El Nifio years (Walsh et al. 1980). However, even if spawning in both species were to occur at the same time, sardine larvae chance of an between reduced primary production and decreased zooplankton biomass. But with respect to the El Nifio event of 1982- 1983, which was probably the strongest since the beginning of this century, larvae of both species did not appear to have any chance of survival when hatched during based de Mendiola 1981; Rojas de Mendiola et al. 1983), total planktonic biomass decreased by an average factor of 15 along all of the Peruvian coast and the temperature in the upper 70 m reached values between 26 30\u00b0C (Villavicencio and Muck larval feeding model (P. and Muck to be for both larvae during the peak of the 1982-1983 El Niiio event. Walsh et al. (1980) state that the high larval mortality of anchoveta, caused by the poor food conditions during the El Niiio of 1965,1972 and 1976, together with overfishing of the adult population, were the main reasons for the collapse of the Peruvian anchoveta stock and the partial replacement of anchoveta by sardine. Zoophagous sardine larvae 4 mm feed on items with a mean particle width of 0.07 mm and have a mouth width of 0.23 mm. Phytophagous anchoveta larvae of 3 mm, on the other hand, which feed on items with a mean particle width of 0.03 mm have a mouth width of 0.24 mm. The fact that sardine larvae have a longer gut than anchoveta of the same size does not appear to be of much ecological relevance because the gut diameter of sardine is smaller than that of anchoveta and thus the entire gut volume is more or less the same (B.

Introduction The Peruvian anchoveta Engraulis (Jenyns) supported for many years the world, and its population ranged between 20 and 30 million tonnes (Longhurst 197 1). It is unarguably the high phyto- and zooplankton production of the and from environmental is certainly the reasons for the persistence of this species in its highly variable environment. Schaefer (1965) correctly pointed out, however, that the high abundance of anchoveta off Peru is primarily a result of predominantly by environmental In tend be strongly affected by of lower elements of the food web. Changes of species and size composition of their food organisms not only have a strong impact on the survival and individual and population growth of pelagic fishes, but also induce change in the geographic the stocks themselves. Outside of the spawning season, the Peruvian anchoveta is generally concentrated at an average distance of 75 lun from the coast, which is where phytoplankton concentrations are *Present address: 7488 Andorra Place, highest (Rojas de Mendiola 1981). Spawning occurs closer to the coast, in colder waters (Santander 198 1). Rojas de Mendiola and G6mez (1981) stressed that certain phytoplankton great importance for anchoveta, i.e.,that this herbivore does not feed on whatever happens to be in the water. Rather, anchoveta largely select kinds affect development and growth of anchoveta differently. Thus, for example in November 1975, in conjunction with the first stage of the El Nifio event of 1976, a change occurred in the composition of the phytoplankton along the northern coast of Peru, which resulted in very high abundance of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium splendens, normally not a food item of adult anchoveta (but see Muck et al., this vol., with regard to larval anchoveta). In May and June 1976, G. splendens had produced widespread blooms. Tsukayama and Alvarez decline of the growth rate of anchoveta during the 1976 spring seasons: specimens of 15 months of age had reached only 12.5 cm and weights almost 30% less than normal. They attributed this to scarcity of appropriate food items and/or to a reduction of their quality. The behavior of anchoveta varies widely between day and night. Johannesson and Vilchez (198 1) demonstrated how schools, formed in daytime, dissolve at night and how the fish move into deeper water. Mathisen (this vol.) related such daily feeding behavior of anchoveta. is thus obvious that from the analysis of fish stomach samples: they can be used to obtain general information on a food chain, on causes of variations of stock abundances in space and time. The first information on the food and feeding habits of anchoveta to become available were published by Vogt (1940), Sears (1941) in Peru, and Schneider (1943), Mann (1954) and de Buen (1958) in Chile. This author began her studies of the food and feeding habits of the Peruvian anchoveta in the early 1950s (Rojas 1953), and the bulk of her further studies were reported in Rojas (1959,1966,1969,197 1,1973,1974,1979,198 Rojas de Mendiola and G6mez (1981), Rojas de Mendiola and Ochoa (1973, 1981), Rojas de Mendiola et al. (1969), Ware et al. (1981) and Muck et al. (this vol.). The key points that emerged from these studies are as follows: the food and feeding habits of change Gymnodinium splendens (see Muck et al., zooplankton adults - at least off central and northern Peru - are almost exclusively phytoplanktivorous; with regard to adult food preference, distinct latitudinal differences are apparent. Anchoveta from the south of Peru and the north of Chile feed almost exclusively on zooplankton while those of the north are phytoplanktivorous. These latitudinal are length (see Palomares et al., 1987), as well as by different vertebral counts. This suggests the existence of at least two different southeastern Pacific coast; changes in environmental conditions such as the El Nifio events of 1972-1973 greatly alter the distribution patterns of the two anchoveta stocks. Thus, the reduction of suitable phytoplankton in the north of Peru led to the almost total disappearance of anchoveta in that area, and the few that were encountered had empty stomachs, or had ingested euphausids. In the south of Peru, on the other hand, anchoveta were found which had relatively long guts, a large number of gill rakers periods example, single had one generalizations were, however, descriptive studies, which do not provide of needed, e.g., for modelling This to a wider scientific community the bulk of the raw data, covering the years 1953 to 1974, upon which earlier studies were based. Together with the data of Alamo (this vol.), covering the years 1974 to 1982, these data can be used to answer questions such as: i) have the quantity and the quality of the food of the Peruvian anchoveta changed in the last decades? ii) if such changes occurred, can they be related to changes of (a) individual, (b) population growth rates and (c) the maturation and reproduction of anchovea? iii) what is the extent of food size selection by anchoveta; e.g., does anchoveta consume the larger or the smaller representatives of the phyto- a larvae and does ihis impact subsequent recruitment? v) are there one or several populations of anchoveta, and if the latter applies, are they distinguishable by their food and feeding habits? It is likely that answers to at least some of these questions, and of other related questions that may be formulated, will be obtained from detailed analysis of the data presented below. Materials Methods Sources of Samples The here stems from different sources and were collected from 19 November 1953 to 8 August 1974. The anchoveta samples of 1953 and early 1954 were obtained on board vessels del Guano\", needed basic information on anchoveta, the major food item of the guano birds (see Tovar 1987 and Muck and Pauly 1987 for an account of their biology). From mid-1954 to 1958, the principal source of samples was the reduction (i.e., fish meal) plants, especially those in the Chimbote area (see Castillo and Mendo 1987 for an account of anchoveta meal production). From 1960 to 1975, samples were obtained from number of sources, notably \"EUREKA\" surveys organized by the Instituto de Investig6ci6n de Recursos Marinos (IREMAR) and its successor, the Instituto del Mar del Peni (IMARPE). Some samples waters. Analytical Procedures (General) generally consisted of about 100 specimens, taken randomly from the catch. They were immediately put into a plastic bag, into which a 20% formalin-seawater solution was poured such as to entirely cover the anchoveta sample and to stop all further digestion process. A label with details on the sample was then put into each bag. This label included the following information: date and hour of sampling, location (or fishing area, see Fig. I), depth (if more than 16 fathoms) and sea surface temperature a plankton sample was using a net with a 75 pm mesh size. Upon working up those samples, it emerged after one year that stomach was decided to take at random subsamples of 20 specimens from the original samples of 100 anchoveta.

In the laboratory, the following information were recorded for each intact individual anchoveta: i) and/or standard length (in mm) ii) total wet weight (in g). The body cavity was then opened and the following were recorded: iii) (iii) and (iv) are given below. Recording of Reproduction-Related Information The scale in Table 1, adapted from Clark (1954) and Einarsson et al. (1966), was used to describe the various maturation stages of the sampled anchoveta. Table 1. Maturity scale for anchoveta, adapted from Clark (1954) and Einarsson et al. (1966)~ Tabla 1. Escala de madurez para la anchoveta, adaptada de Clark (1954) y Einarsson et al. (1 966). Stage Def'ition I Immature <8 cm TL a time when anchoveta and other clupeoids were assumed to spawn only once or twice during a spawning season. The recent finding that anchoveta and other clupeoids may spawn once a week during the spawning season (see Lasker 1985) does not detract from the utility of the older scale as a descriptive tool (see other contributions in this vol.). bMaturity stage IV is used at IMARPE to separate the adult from the juvenile stock (see also Pauly and Soriano 1987). CColor differences are used to differentiate stages V and VI. Recording of Food and Feeding-Related Information The digestive tract of each anchoveta was removed, and gently extended. Its length was then measured (in mm, from the pylorus to the anus). Then, the stomachs (gastric and pyloric parts) were separated from the rest of the gut, and weighted (to the nearest mg). Their degree of fullness was then determined according the for quantifying the fullness of anchoveta stomachs. Tabla 2.

All identifications were performed with a compound microscope. This type of detailed analysis was replaced, starting in 1959 and in the early 1960s by a less detailed analysis, i.e., all identifications were still performed at the species level, but without counting the single cells of aliquots or the individual zooplankton in the whole fish larvae were always counted; the identification of sample was put into a Petri dish, and the overall ratio of phyto- to phases: i) initial tabulation on raw data sheet (by and including counts or relative abundance This occurred fiom 1953 1974 and formed the basis for the author's various publications and feeding habits, listed above; ii) retabulation in 1987 by the author of a large fraction of the data in (i) reduced as follows: a) only 115 of all fish from each sample were taken (at random), such as to reduce the number of fish collected at the same place, date and hour; b) only the 4 or 5 most abundant food items reported from each stomach were included (the overall list of items still intludes over 259 entries, see Pauly et al., this vol.) iii) creation, in 1988, at ICLARM, of a computerized database including the data in (ii) and those of Alarno (this vol.).

Pauly and using the DBase 111 Plus pro- gram implemented on an IBM XT-compatible microcomputer. Finally, Ms. and database reported here includes on 3,682 specimens of anchoveta, sampled from 11 November 1953 to 8 August 1974. Fig. 1 illustrates the spatial distribution of these 3,682 specimens along the Peruvian coast, as well as the code used to record the sampling locations. Further details on the contents and organization of this database, which also includes the anchoveta stomach content data of Alamo (this vol.) may be found in Appendix I of this volume. A very preliminary analysis of some aspects of this database is presented in Pauly et al. (this vol.). Readers are welcome to probe further.

Materials and Methods Sampling Procedures The data presented here were collected from 3 September 1974 to 18 October 1982, and consist of records for 6,053 specimens of juvenile and adult anchoveta caught off Peru between 4 and 18's. All fish samples were preserved in 10% formalin and the sampling data and hour were recorded. Sampling locations were reported as lo Marsden squares (during computerization, the Marsden square numbers were replaced by the longitude and latitude corresponding to the center of each square, see Fig. 2), and the sea surface temperature noted. Overall, sampling procedures resembled those of Rojas de Mendiola (this vol.). Analytical Procedures In the laboratory the specimens each were analyzed individually, and the following information i) total length (in cm), ii) total wet weight (in g), iii) sex and maturity stage, iv) amount of visceral fat, v) stomach content weight (in g), Fig. 2.

Introduction This contribution presents a preliminary analysis of the food types and food consumption of the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), based on the data of Rojas de Mendiola (this vol.) and Alamo (this vol.), covering the years 1953 to 1982. No attempt will be made here to extract all information contained in the now computerized RojasIAlamo database. Rather we aim at providing a future, more detailed studies on the feeding habits of anchoveta in relation fluctuations of the Peruvian upwelling system. This of the taxonomic diversity anchoveta food items; ii) testing of some extant hypotheses on the spatial and temporal variations of the fraction (ZF), i.e., stomach contents; and iii) estimation of the daily ration of an \"average\" anchoveta and of the relative food con- sumption of the entire population. Part three (a) to illustrate the wide range and the frequency of occurrence of food items recorded from anchoveta stomachs, (b) to identify the taxonomic affinities of these food items and (c) to assign these food items to a small number of taxonomically homogeneous groups, hypotheses involved in Part (ii) are: (a) that anchoveta in the north of Peru have lower ZF values than those in the south, (b) that anchoveta have a lower ZF than (c) temperatures (SST) are associated with higher ZF and (d) in the 1950s had higher ZF than in (Palomares et al. 1987). Finally, we shall present in Part (iii) the first rigorous attempt to estimate the daily ration of anchoveta based on stomach content data. Our aim here is to comparison 1987), and eventually, to allow quantitative modelling of the transfer of primary production off Peru (Chgvez et al., this vol.; Mendo et al., this vol.) to higher trophic levels. For general orientation, we present a photo of an anchoveta (Fig. 1.) and, in Figs. 2,3 and Table 1, some key anatomical features of anchoveta that are related to food capture and processing.

Materials and Methods The data used for Part (i) of this contribution are the raw data sheets of Rojas de Mendiola (this vol.) and Alamo (this vol.), which include, for each anchoveta sampled, up to six of the most abundant food items. Each of these food items was listed, and the total number of occurrences was recorded (no distinction was made between the periods covered by the data of Rojas de Mendiola, this vol., and those of Alamo, this vol.). Then, the taxonomic affinities or Barnes 1980) and phylogenetic \"trees\" were constructed which included only organisms recorded as anchoveta food item. Finally, fifteen represent compromises between taxonomic homogeneity roughly similar number of occurrences within each group. Part (ii) is based on analysis of the ZF values in the Rojas/Alamo database. Fig. 4 presents the geographic distribution of entries in this database, as well as definitions for: (a) the northern, central and southern sections of the Peruvian coast (all locations north of 9'59'S, 10\u00b000' - 13\u00b059'S and all coastal strip inhabited anchoveta. With regard to hypotheses (c) (d) above, the three temperature ranges selected are c17, and 220\u00b0C, while the three periods considered are 1953 to 1974, 1975 to 1978 and 1979 to 1985. The cutoff points used for hypotheses (a) to (d) were selected such as to allow enough entries to be represented in each of the three groups used for the comparisons, and also such as to be consistent with an earlier subdivision (that between northern, central and southern anchoveta stock of normalizing Rohlf 1981; Sachs 1984), a fact which we confinned for data at hand. inshore waters intermediate waters offshore water Fig. 4.

The scale expressing degree of stomach fullness used by Rojas de Mendiola (this vol.) \"half % values: \"empty\" = 0% and Rojas de empty\" differs from that however, categories could therefore not be set equal to each other and to 50%. We have, therefore, used an approach, b in (stomach * 100 = square the reduced form \"half stomach content weights (Sm,) for for which only fullness values had been available and a need to use an appropriate number of classes, i.e., between about 12 and 20 (Sokal and Rohlf 1981). In view of the non-normal distribution of the Sm) values within each temporal class, we abstained from using where Dl are the and the 9th deciles, respectively, and 2 the median, i.e., the 5th decile (Sachs 1984). The corresponding estimate of standard deviation is Standard errors (s.e.) were computed from The model used here for the estimation of food consumption (i.e., daily ration, or %) from the diurnal dynamics of stomach contents is the simpler of two models presented by Sainsbury (1986). The model assumes that the 24-hour diurnal cycle can be split phase, during which feeding occurs at a constant constant fraction (c) of the stomach content (simultaneously) being during which stomach evacuation takes place. 24-hour cycle z is the \"physiological time,\" measured from the of feeding period the mean weight rate Tm the duration (in hour) of the feeding period, and Sr the residual stomach content at the beginning of feeding period, then the of stomach content can be calculated as during feeding time when 0 < z < Tm, and during nonfeeding time when Tm < < 24 hours, wherein The daily ration of food consumed is calculated as % = a Tm. Fitting of equation (5) to our data was performed after smoothing the data over three time intervals, using a BASIC program implemented on an MS-DOS compute@, and representing a modified version of a FORTRAN listing Sainsbury (CSIRO, growth was the equation growth increment (= growth rate) obtained from a Available from the fist author. i.e., from the first derivative of the von Bertalanffy Growth Function (VBGF). The VBGF has, for growth in weight the form where Wt is the weight at age t W, the asymptotic weight K a growth constant, and to the \"age\" at weight zero. The estimate of K1 was then used to estimate the parameter P in the equation: through Using P and K, food consumption (Q) per unit biomass (B) of an age-structured population (QIB) can be estimated using a simplified version of the model of Pauly (1986), of the form where K1(t) is the gross conversion efficiency as a function of fish age (obtained by combining equations (8) and (9)), Z is the exponential rate of total mortality in the population (8). Transfer efficiency (&) was obtained, finally, from Et = Z * (BIQ), i.e., by multiplying the inverse of the relative food consumption by the biomass ratio (because Z = P/B under steady-state conditions, see Allen 197 1).

Altogether 259 different food items were identified, from nearly 10,000 individual anchoveta, and this number would have been far greater had it not been for the fact that only the 5-6 most abundant food items were recorded from each stomach is presented in Table 2 to arrange these food items into 15 more or less homogeneous groups with roughly comparable numbers of occurrences (ratio smallest to largest = 1:27, i.e., 1.43 log units).

Tsukayarna and Sanchez (1981), based on Villavicencio (1981), and on experiments in which they fed fish flesh to anchoveta, estimated a daily consumption of 4% BWD for anchoveta of 10 g. Cushing (1978) suggested that \"the daily ration as percentage of body weight for a fish as small as the anchoveta is likely to be nearer 5% than 1%. If the mean length were 12.5 a reasonable daily ration would be equal to 0.66 ml, which is 10 times the weight of algae in the guts\". Equations (6) to (1 I), applied to Gushing's estimate of ration for 12.5 cm anchoveta (i.e., of 13 g), and assuming 1 ml = 1 g, the same growth and mortality as used above, of to 3.5% reported in Palomares et al. (1987). However, these lower based on with Brett and Groves (1979), that zooplankton provides about four times more net energy than the pure phytoplankton diet considered by value, zoo- and phytoplankton in the diet of anchoveta. This is close enough to our estimate, considering that it actually was a \"guesstimate\". Our value of Et = 0.373 is, on et also higher than the range of 0.10-0.20 used by Chavez et al. (this vol.). However, this high value is in line with Muck (this vol.) who suggests that anchoveta has a higher growth (i.e., trophic) efficiency than sardine, for which values up been proposed (Lasker 1973).

Introduction Numerous monthly in the volume edited by Pauly and Tsukayama (1987) as part of a multidisciplinary effort to identify the factors which determine the recruitment of the Peruvian anchoveta (Engrau- lis ringens). The opportunity is taken here to add to this database a time series of monthly fat content data, representing one of the factors impact on reproduction, and hence maturity is attained, growth is reduced, and the bulk of the energy intake is used to build the results of studies on adult Engraulis ringens which show that at 15OC the maintenance ration is 2.3% body weights per of content dynamics, and more precisely, a model to predict the fat content of anchoveta from environmental and other data would be useful to unravel the population dynamics of anchoveta. The present contribution is an attempt to derive such predictive model. Materials and Methods The fat content data used for the present contribution stem from four sources: i) the report of Lam (1968) for the years 1968 to 1972, ii) from field stations (\"Laboratorios Costeros\") of IMARPE for the years 1968 to 1976, iii) from the archives of the state fishing enterprise PESCAPERU and from various EUREKA cruises for the years 1977 to 1986. iv) some of the data of Alamo (this vol.) on visceral fat stages of anchoveta for the years 1974 to 1982 were also analyzed, with emphasis on their relationship to the percentage fat content data which form the bulk of the present contribution. The time series reconstructed from the data in (i) to (iii) has some noticeable gaps. Some of these could have been filled by pooling the data from Chimbote (9'05's) and Callao (12OOO'S), but this was not done, due to clear differences in the fat content of anchoveta from these two sampling sites (see below). The fat content data presented here refer to either of three size groups: i) anchoveta of 12 to 14 cm TL ii) anchoveta 2 14 cm TL iii) \"average\" adult anchoveta, i.e., the mean of the values in (i) and (ii). The available fat content data, averaged on a monthly basis were plotted against time and other variables with which they could be expected to correlate. Following a suggestion of anchoveta (c.f. in weight in g), SST anomaly (in \"C) a dummy variable (loc.) expressing the sampling location (Callao = 0, Chimbote = I), and 11 additional dummy variables expressing the month of the year (only 11 such variables are needed, i.e., when all are set at zero, the 12th month is implied). This model regression option of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. Of the data of Alamo (this vol.) only 1,381 individual records were used (23% of the total file), pertaining to anchoveta > 12 cm LT (\"adult used for Chimbote and Callao are reproduced here as Tables 1 and 2. The c.f. data stem from Tsukayama and Palomares (1987); only actual values were used, i.e., values estimated from in the analyses. Results and Discussion Tables 3 and 4 present the available monthly time series of fat content of adult anchoveta for Chimbote and Callao, respectively. A subset of these data, pertaining to the years 1964-1976 only, is presented as Figs. 1 and 2 in the form of averaged seasonal patterns. As might be seen from these figures, anchoveta caught off Chimbote have a higher fat content than those caught off Callao, particularly from April to June. Fig. 3 depicts the seasonal trend of fat content of anchoveta expressed by the data of Alamo (this vol.). As might be seen, this trend is roughly similar to those in Figs. 1 and 2. The basic similarity between the data in Tables 3 and 4 and those of Alamo (this vol.) is also illustrated by Fig. 4, which allowed derivation of illustrates the positive relationship between the condition factor of anchoveta and its fat content. This relationship is also expressed by + loglo (c.f.) ... 3) which, with r = 0.426 and d.f. 206, is significant (P < 0.01). Table 1. Mean 7b031U3; \"Celsius. (Data courtesy of Dr. P. Lagos). Tabla I.

Introduction The Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), constituted the base of the Peruvian fish meal and oil industry during the 1960s and 1970s. In view of this, the Instituto del Mar del Perii (IMARPE) and its predecessor, the Instituto de 10s directed their research towards this resource, accumulating biological information on this species from the 1950s to date. Part of this information has been analyzed and published in the book \"The Peruvian Anchoveta and Its Upwelling Ecosystem: (Pauly and Tsukayama objective of the present work is to contribute to the biological data time series published in the above-mentioned book, by presenting and analyzing data on the sexual maturity of anchoveta sampled from different regions of the Peruvian coast. *PROCOPA Contribution No. 93. Materials and Methods For this study, data on sexual maturity stages obtained through biological sampling of the landings of the industrial fishery have been used. The samples were grouped into three regions: north (06\"-9'59'S), central (10\u00b0-13059'S) and south (14\u00b0-18030'S) (Fig. 1). Sexual maturity were by macroscopic observation of the gonads, used 1. Definition of noahem, central and southem areas off the Peruvian coast. as used in this contribution.

(1988), and the data presented here represent a subset of those compiled in that paper. Particularly, we do not report here our results on a basis. 2 and 3 show the monthly mean values of sexual maturity in the northernlcentral and southern stocks of adult anchoveta (2 10.25 cm), for the 1961-1987 period. As might be seen, these values tend to increase through time, especially so in the south. The highest mean maturity stages generally occurred, for both stocks, during the spring and summer months, when stages IV, V and VI predominate (see Table 1).

Variation of the Maturity Stages Both the northernlcentral and the southern stocks show a large fraction of individuals to be in stage I during the 1960s and 1970s. Additionally, low values were observed in the northerdcentral stock in 1961-1963 and from 1971 to 1987, except for 1976, and in the southern stock in 1968- 1969 and from 197 1 to 1987, except for 198 1 (Table 2). Table 3 gives the percent markedly 1966, especially in the southern values in this stock are obtained during 1963- 1966 and 1979-1984, and the highest in 1967-1977 and from 1986 on; for the northernlcentral stock, the lowest values belong to 1971-1967 period, which was followed by relatively high values from 1968 on. Both stocks generally have their highest the P~N, 1961-1987. Tabla 1.

Year January February March no large fluctuations in the northedcentral stock, except for 1978 and 1987. The highest values are generally observed in spring and summer, and the lowest during the autumn and early winter months. The southern stock shows greater fluctuations than the northernlcentral stock, with low values during 1963-1974. From 1975 on, an increase can be observed, and a maximum is reached in spring 1982. In both stocks, the highest values occur in spring and the lowest in autumn-winter. The mean values of stages V and VI (Table 5) in the northedcentral stock were relatively constant during 1961- 197 1, while high values occurred 1962,1965,1968- 1969 and 1985- 1987.

Abstract This on the detailed analysis half-degree squares) of 90 maps of anchoveta (Engradis ringens) egg standing stock off Peru (4-14\"S), published in 1987 by H. Santander (IMARPE, Callao, Peru). It pertains to surveys conducted from of the preceding and following months. Monthly egg distribution are presented, averaged over the periods 1964 to 1971 and 1972 to 1986, which are the phases preceding and following the 1972-1973 El Nio and the coincident stock collapse, respectively. It is shown that the center of gravity of anchoveta egg production has shifted to the south along the coast. Also, the relationship between the two egg production seasons (August-October, January-March) has changed: egg production was much higher in spring than summer from 1964 to 1971, but was, from 1972 to 1986, slightly higher in summer. Overall, mean daily egg production was reduced from about 3.13 x 1013 in 1964-1971 to about 2.2 x 1013 in 1972-1986.

Introduction The Peru the largest single-species1 fishery of the world (Tsukayarna and Palomares 1987). The collapse of this fishery, coincident with the 1972-1973 El Nifio, has been, in earlier years, attributed to this hydrographic anomaly but fishery was the main culprit (see Muck, this vol.). The need to better manage this resource makes it particularly important to identify the key factors which determine recruitment of anchoveta. The present study is concerned with a process most likely to belong to these factors: the apparent rate of production of eggs by the anchoveta stock. The word \"apparent\", which will be omitted henceforth, refers to the fact derived and presented further below do account for egg mortality, which is covered by Pauly and Soriano (this vol.). Also, the geographical distribution of this egg production will be presented. However, due to limitations of the available data, the pertinent maps will refer only to monthly 'climatological' averages for two periods - 1964 to 1971 and 1972 to 1986. This division of the available data into two sets was chosen to cover two crucial phases: one of high anchoveta biomasses, lasting from the beginning of egg survey work to the 1972-1973 El Niiio, and of generally low, but highly variable biomasses, lasting from 1972 to 1986 (see Pauly and Palomares, this vol.). Materials and Method The present contribution, extracted from Senocak (1988), is based entirely on the 90 maps of egg distribution in Santander (1987), pertaining to the area off Peru comprised between 4 and 14's and based on surveys conducted from 1964 to 1986. Santander (1987) provides details on these surveys. Of this information, only the map number, the year and the month are reported here (Table 1). Sampling was performed from 50 m to the surface with a Hensen net 175 cm long, 70 cm aperture diameter and 300 nm meshes. Table 1.

The original station records were not accessible to the authors; hence, this work is based on the maps of egg abundance assembled since 1964 by H. Santander and colleagues at IMARPE, of which all had been redrawn at ICLARM, Manila, using a base map and schemes (Table 2). The surveys documented through Santander's maps did not all cover the investigation area as defined in Fig. 1. However, no large-scale interpolation or extrapolation were applied for (within half- 2), i.e., larger areas not covered during a given survey were not included in any of the analyses. Each half-degree square included in the analysis was divided up into 100 subunits and the egg abundance (d) for limits and assumed class means of anchoveta egg abundance maps in Santander (1987), in eggs/m2.

The mean abundance of eggs per m2 (Ej) in a given half degree during a given survey and square (i) was then estimated from: where Nj is the number of subunits in (j), nl the number of subunits of a given egg 2), and dl the mean number of eggs per m2 for that group of subunits. Note that directly under the coast, squares with N < 100 were rather frequent (see Fig. 1). The estimated development time of anchoveta eggs were taken, for the years 1964-1982 . from Table 3 in Santander (1987). For the following period, which lasted to the end of 1986, development time (D, in days) was estimated from where T is the sea surface temperature (SST, in OC), and which was derived by Pauly (1987) from equation (5) in Pauly and Pullin (1988) and from empirical data in Santander and Sandoval de Castillo (1973). The temperature used to represent the Peruvian coast from 4 to 14OC south for the years 1982-1986 are means of the monthly temperatures for Talara, Paita, Chimbote and Callao (see Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4).

This resulted in the elimination of gaps while simultaneously leading to the emergence of interpretable spatial patterns. Without missing values, the smoothing scheme in Fig. 5 will not lead to biased means, but to reduced values of Pdj were averaged for the periods 1964 to 197 1 and 1972 to 1986. Santander's maps were Mercator projections, i.e., the east-west extent (e.g., in km) of a one- degree \"square\" changes with latitude (see Table 4). These values were used to convert the smoothed egg production estimates per m2 within each half-degree square into production estimates per total area. Finally, the geographic center of gravity of the anchoveta egg production was computed for each of the 12 months in the two periods by multiplying the production in each half-degree square by the latitude and longitude of its center, then computing the (weighted) average latitudes and longitudes by monlh. 1/2 degree longitude Table 4.

Results and Discussion The smoothed \"climatological\" maps of monthly anchoveta egg production obtained here for the periods 1964 to 1971 and 1972 to 1986 are presented here in Figs. 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d. As might be seen, maximum egg production generally occurs in a single band right along the coast, although there are indications in certain months (e.g., February or first period) of two distinct spawning \"centra\" (sensu Mathisen, this vol.), one at about 8OS, the other at about 13's. The center of gravity for both series (1964 to 1986) and all months combined is 9'42'S, which is very close to the value of 9'48's that can be estimated from Table 2 of Santander (1987). This implies that Santander's large-scale extrapolation of mean production (eggshn2/day) for the large white star the production values. geogrrifica de promedios rnensuales de produccidn de huevos de anchoveta (huevosldldia) para Ios meses de Enero, Marzo, durante dos peri'odos (arriba 1964-1971; abajo 1972-1986).

Fig. 7 presents the center of gravity of anchoveta egg production off Peru on a monthly basis, for each of the two periods distinguished here. As might be seen, spawning of anchoveta in 1972- 1986 involved more seasonal changes than it did in 1964- 197 1. Also, a shift southward along the coast appears to have occurred. This may be in line with the \"southernization\" hypothesis of Palomares et al. (1987), which states that Engraulis ringens off northernlcentral Peru have become, over the last decades, more similar to their southern counterparts - in terms of various aspects of their biology - than earlier. Fig. 8 presents, finally, monthly averaged estimates of total anchoveta egg production off Peru (4-140's) for the two periods considered here. The similarity between the two curves involves: i) evidence of two peaks per year, one lasting from January to March (\"summer\"), the other from August to October (\"spring\") and 80 79 78 Longitude (OW 1 80 79 7 8 Longitude (OW 1 Fig. 7.

However, it is the difference between these two curves which strikes us most. In the first period (1964-1971), the spring peak was much larger than the summer peak, while both peaks are more or less equal in the second period (1972-1986). A number of could be presented large (Senocak 1988). However, as out in the egg production rates estimated here are apparent rates, i.e., they egg mortality. We shall, therefore, abstain from suggesting here a cause for the change reflected in Fig. 8. The reader is invited, however, to consult Pauly and Soriano (this vol.) for a follow-up on anchoveta egg production and mortality.

Abstract The egg production of anchoveta was estimated by month from 1953 to of derived surveys conducted to This yielded estimates of affecting anchoveta egg mortality, a hypotheses which will have to be tested in a future contribution. Resumen Se estim6 la producci6n de huevos mensual de la anchoveta peruana (414\"s) de 1953 a 1985 basado en estimaciones de la fecundidad biomasa de hembras maduras y factores relacionados para el period0 1953-1985 frente a P~N (4-14\"s).

Sin embargo, como 10s resultados lo sugieren, la concentracih de padres (m5s que el tamaiio del stock de padres) es el pahetro clave que afecta la mortalidad de huevos, una hip6tesis que deberi ser probada en una contribucih futura. Introduction Recruitment to a stock depends on (i) the size of the spawning stock and (ii) the survival of the eggs and larvae. Within fishery biology, literature exists how to forecast the recruitment of fish stock given a knowledge of spawning stock size, i.e., from the \"top-down\" (reviews in controlling the survival of eggs and larvae (see, e.g., papers in Sharp 1980 and Rothschild 1986). While generally, \"bottom-up\" approaches have been more costly, more data intensive, successful based on an understanding of all aspects of their life history, including the early stages. In the case of the Peruvian anchoveta, sufficient data are available on the dynamics of the parent stock, and on the distribution and density of the eggs to justify an attempt to major causes of anchoveta egg mortality. *ICLARM Contribution No. 507. Materials and Methods Two sources tapped estimates obtained by (Pauly estimate parent biomass, mature female the period January 1953 to July 1985, using a model to be briefly described further below; and ii) Ninety maps of anchoveta egg distribution based on egg surveys conducted from 1964 to 1985, and which were published and subjected to preliminary analyses by Santander (1987) and Senocak et al. (this vol.). The model used here to estimate the monthly reproductive output (RO), i.e., egg production, of anchoveta has the form: where j is the number of length classes for which, in a anchoveta biomass estimates are available (see Table 1 for the definition of the other terms). Fig. 1 gives an example of the type of maps published by Santander (1987) and the first five columns of Table 2 summarize the key information pertaining to or extracted from these maps. Most important here is the fifth column, i.e., the estimates of egg standing stock, derived by planimetry (Santander 1987). [Some of these covered less the 4- the Peruvian used here as reference. The estimated egg standing stocks for these maps have been, in these cases, extrapolated to the whole reference area using a procedure documented in Santander (1987). The detailed planimetry of Senocak et al. (this vol.), which did not involve any large-scale extrapolation, shows that by Pauly and Soriano (1987) to estimate the egg production of Pemvian anchoveta (equation 1). by month (i), based on biomass data by length class (jp.

Detalles de dste mapa (No. 79 en Santander 19871, presentado aqui como un ejemplo, se ah en la Tabla 2. Pauly (1987) had attempted to estimate anchoveta egg mortality by relating theoretical egg production (as estimated via equation I), to the egg standing stock in Santander's maps. However, the model he used \"the cannibalization of mchoveta eggs\" (inclusive of his 2 and Fig. 4) is thus erroneous. Nd as the egg standing stock at the end of period D, and R as the initial size of a \"cohort\" of anchoveta eggs, it follows for that cohort, that: where Z is the egg mortality from spawning/fertilization to hatching and D (days) is the egg development time. The parameter D can be estimated from: where T is the sea surface temperature (SST, in OC) and which was derived by Pauly (1987) based on data in Santander and Sandoval de Castillo (1973) and equation (5) in Pauly and Pullin (1988). under steady-state condition (assumed here to prevail shortly before, during a given egg survey was conducted andfor during a period of one month), standing stock (N) whose value can be estimated from: - 1 D N = - JRe-zo Do Table 2.

Results and Discussion Parental Biomass and Egg Production, 1953 to 1985 Fig. 2 and Tables 3,4 and 5 present the results obtained by applying equation (1) to the biomass data generated by Pauly and Palomares (this vol.). The estimates of parental biomass in Fig. 2 resemble those published earlier by Pauly and Soriano (1987). As was the case earlier, the lone independent estimate of parental biomass obtained for AugustISeptember 198 1 using the egg production method (Santander et al. 1984) is very close to our estimates of parental biomass for that period (see also Table 3, footnote). 1 I Mature p based on the egg produc- tion method 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 Year Fig. 2.

Thus, in order for our estimates of egg mortality to be as accurate as possible, we have replaced, in Table respectively) in all two biomass estimates for the same month differed by adjusted estimates are given in brackets in Table 2. The Evidence for Egg Cannibalism in Anchoveta Fig. 3A presents a plot of ln(N/(D.P)) vs. parental stock size (P) for the period 1964 to 1985. As might be seen, there is a strong negative correlation between the egg survival index (ln(N/(D.P))) and parent stock, suggesting a strong parental stock on egg mortality rate. This confirms an earlier plot of Santander (1987) based on maps covering the period 1964 to 1982 and on the parental biomass estimates of Pauly and Soriano (1987). However, parental biomass is not the only factor affecting anchoveta egg survival, and we have derived, to illustrate this, the model: where T is the SST in OC and where R2 = 0.594 (see also Fig 3B and Table 6). Fig. 4 shows that the residuals of this model lack structure, as required for multiple linear regression. Equation (7), it must be realized, is only one of the many possible models, and should not be taken as of factors affecting anchoveta egg survival. Interesting here is Fig. 5 which shows the dependent variable of equation (7) as a function of temperature. As might be seen, some 1 ~og~~ parent stock (t x lo6) Fig. 3.

Abstract Tie sea (SST) of shore stations available period 1950-1988, were analyzed with reference to the spatial and temporal of SST and related standard deviation, and dis- cussed with regard the spawning strategies of the Peruvian anchoveta (Engradis ringenr). Resumen Se presenta un an6lisis de las series de tiempo de la tanperatura superficial del mar (TSM) para nueve estaciones costeras del Peni (4- 17\"s) para el period0 1950-1988. Los resultados son analizados con respecto a la variabilidad temporal y local de la TSM y su respectiva desviaciiin estandar, y es discutido con respecto a las estrategias de desove de la anchoveta (Engraulis ringens). Introduction Time series of spatial means of sea temperature (SST) for the area 4-14's been reported in Pauly and Tsukayama vol.; Mendo et al., this vol.; Pauly and Soriano, this vol.) Priority is given in these studies to the analyses Niiio whole area (4-14's). However, little has been reported on the spatial (e.g., north-south) distribution of SST and the temporal and spatial vari- ability of that distribution. SST provides of the et al. (1987); Mendo et al. vol.)). On the other hand, the SST-standard deviation (SST-SD) its stochastic nature. It might be the latter one which determines the degree series analyzed here, pertaining to nine shore stations, cover a period of 38 years (1950- 1988) and are documented in Muck et al. (1989). The nine shore stations are: Talara (04'343); Paita (05'05'S); Puerto 1'02's); (12'04's); Pisco (13'40's); San Juan (15'21's); and Ilo (17'38's). The missing values in the original data set (= 24%. referring almost exclusively to the first decade (1950-1960)) were linearly interpolated by Muck et al. (1989) in all cases where only one or two months, were missing, or estimated by linear regression between the time series of neighboring stations when the missing sequence was of three months or more (Muck et al. 1989). The SST-SD values used throughout this express nine measurements available for each month from 1950 to 1988. Diskette 1 (see Appendix I) provides the uncorrected SST time series for shore stations. Results Discussion The SST-anomalies events) and abnormally cold periods. Between 1950 and 1987, there were five period with a negative anomaly <- 1 'C (Fig. 1). Year Fig. 1. Tie series of mean annual sea surface temperature andy off Pem, 1950-1987. Fig. I. Serie a2 tiempo de 10s promedws anuales de anomalias de la temperatura superjkial del marfrente a Peri, 1950-1987. The curve of the annual anomaly of the SST-SD-values (Fig. 2) shows a pattern similar to that of Fig. 1: years with SST-anomalies were also years with SST-SD-anomalies. In other words, the differences of SST between the nine shore stations along the Peruvian coast are higher during years with El Niiio events than during normal ones, and conversely lower during cold years. Year Fig. 2. Time series of anomalies of mean aunual standard deviation of nine coastal stations off Peru (4-17\"s). Fig. 2. Serie de tiempo de anomalias de 10s promedios anuales de las desviacwnes estandnr de la tempemtura superficial del mar, en nueve estaciones costerasfiente a Perl(4-ITS). Comparing the curves of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, it is notable that during the 1972 and 1976 El Niiio events, the occur well before the SST-anomalies. a the spatial and temporal pattern of SST-anomalies during the very north-south also shows that the maximum SST-anomaly occurs in the south of Peru (near San Juan-Ilo) about three months later than from which shows clearly two periods with different regimes: a period of very high SST-SD-values between April and July (autumn, early winter) and a longer period of low SST-SD between August and March (mid-winter, spring, summer). Low values of monthly SST-SD means spatial mean all monthly SST-SD-values in Fig. 3 can be interpreted as an index of the spatial homogeneity of SST. In other words, the high values of mean monthly SST-SD occurring May and June indicate low while during August- suggest during this period, area covered here (4-17's) has very similar characteristics (i.e., is very homogeneous). Thermal variability can be assumed to reflect the such as upwelling, mixed layer. Thus, generalizing my interpretation of the dynamics of SST-SD, I that the curye given to the communities within the ecosystem, from periods of low to periods of high environmental uncertainty. When comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 7 in Pauly (1987) on the seasonal cycle of anchoveta spawning SST-SD-values are highest. The same match is found when one compares the second smaller spawning peak of February-March with the corresponding SST-SD-values. I I I I I I I I I I Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Month Fig. 3. Mean standard deviation of averages based on the yean 1950 to 1987. High values suggest lack of homogeneity along the coast and of reproductive major spawning season of anchoveta. Fig. 3.

Nbtese 10s bajos valores durante Agosto-Noviernbre, es decir, durante la estacibn principal de desove de anchoveta. Plotting monthly data of the fraction of mature females from Callao and Chimbote samples (Jordan 1980, in Pauly and Soriano 1987) vs. the SST-SD for these areas (Table 1) led to Fig. 4. This indicates a strong negative correlation between the percentage of in corresponding months. evolutionary veta spawning occurs conditions will be occur, noted that some anchoveta spawn throughout the year. Paulik (1981) on this: afford on the weather. Lack of spawning success in a single year could be disastrous. So anchoveta hedges its bet by spawning over the entire year and increasing its chances of encountering favorable spawning question arises: Are there anchoveta (sub)populations, September to November, the other throughout the year? Fig. 5 shows the trend of October values of SST-SD (i.e., during the main spawning season) 1950 to 1987. In this graph, low SST-SD-values imply that spawning in October was the thing do, while high values of SST-SD indicate that spawning over the whole year was the better strategy. As might be seen, this graph suggests that from the mid-1960s to the mid- 1980s, spawning over the whole year was the better strategy. This should have led to a reduced fitness of fish to spawning November, and hence of their proportion in the overall population, relative to anchoveta with a tendency to spawn year-round. The findings of Senocak et al. (this vol.) support this hypothesis. Y = 85.1 x-~.~~ r = 0.63; df =I9 0 points used; o points not used i Fig. 4.

Small doses, on the other hand, result in marks (rings) that are difficult to detect; these doses, however, protect the fish against infections associated with the insertion of, e.g., individual tags. In this study, therefore, a wide range of doses were administered to enable of dosage. Materials The reported upon were conducted on 240 juvenile of These experiments were conducted in Peru in January 1975 and May 1977 with the three Peruvian species, and at the Marine Laboratory of the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Beaufort, North Carolina in May 1976. Some reading and photographing of labelled material were done at the MAFF in Aberdeen, Scotland, in October 1976-April 1977. The fish used for the experiments were either scooped from commercial purse (anchoveta gill and menhaden). Only fish not affected by netting (i.e., which had survived for 35 days) and which had been feeding actively for at least 20 days were used for the tetracycline marking experiment 1). They either 4,000-1 tanks, or in floating live boxes anchored off San Lorenzo Island, near Callao, at water temperature of about 15\u00b0C. In the latter case, which applied to some anchoveta and silverside, the fish consumed food naturally produced in the boxes. The anchoveta, sardine and silverside in the tanks were fed minced fish flesh supplemented with a commercial fishmeal-based poultry feed, or in some special cases, tetracycline-labelled Artemia salina. The menhaden were fed commercial pellets such as generally used at the Beaufort Laboratory of NMFS. Prior to administration of tetracycline, the individual fish were: 1. exposed, until the respiratory movements slowed down, to a solution of the anesthetic MS 222 (at a concentration of about 1: 10,000 in seawater) or of Quinaldine (about one drop per liter of Preliminary operations and insertion of individual tags group A of group B marks of group B Holding tanks or floating boxes (seining or (35 days, of which 20 actively gillnetting) - 60 days -+ 4 days dose 60 days - 4- 60days-4 (1 b 120 days -4 Fig. 1.

Introduction The Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) occurs off the coast of Peru, with heaviest concentrations along the northern and central areas. Anchoveta adult distribution (Villanueva 1975) and their egg distribution (Santander 1987) suggest the presence, during the spawning periods, 1; Tsukayama 1966) and tagging experiments support the hypothesis that the anchoveta resources in the Peruvian southern area (Atico-110) constitute a stock distinct from the northernlcentral stock documented in Pauly and Tsukayama (1987). The growth of the northernkentral stock has been studied by Pauly and Tsukayama (1983) and especially by Palomares et al. (1987), who also reviewed earlier studies. In contrast with the northern/central stock, little is known on the growth of the southern stock. In this contribution, the growth of the latter stock is determined and length-frequency data collected in the southern region of Peru in 1979. Materials and Methods The length-frequency data used for this analysis were collected monthly during 1979 by IMARPE staff along the southern area comprising the harbors of La Planchada, Atico, Mollendo and Ilo. A subsample of one pair of otoliths for each 0.5 cm total length interval was obtained from the 110 samples (n = 163). The otoliths were studied with a compound microscope following on the progression, during the course of the year, of the ring in the margin of the otolith and by comparing the number of daily increments in the otoliths with the age determined from the rings. For this last method, a subsample of otoliths (n = 18) covering a wide range of ages was prepared for by applying of July as arbitrary annual age-length key was constructed. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) were estimated by means of the ETAL I program (Gaschiitz et al. 1980). As the age-length key does not reflect seasonal changes in growth, curve was accounting for seasonality. Fitting of the growth curve to the length-frequency data was done by using the ELEFAN I program (Pauly and David 1981; Pauly 1987; Palomares et al. 1987). Here, the length-frequency data are used to estimate the growth parameters Loo, K, C (amplitude of the seasonal growth oscillations), and WP (time or MPA (George and Baaerji 1964; Sparre 1987), as included in the Compleat ELEFAN program package of Gayanilo et al. (19881, was used to determine the mean length and associated statistics of each presumed age group the available length-frequency samples. These were then interlinked in a fashion thought to reflect growth. The MPA of the (normal) method of Cassie (1950), was also applied to the data of Table 2. The growth increments resulting from MPA were treated as if they data, using each of successive mean lengths as (length t) and recapture lengths (length at age t+ At). The reading the available were also used to derive growth increments (i.e, \"tagginglrecapture\" data). This was achieved: (i) by using only the increments between year groups and counting twice the increment between age 1 and 2, which is well represented in the samples (see Table 2) and (ii) by using the appropriate routine of the software documented by Brey et al. (1988). The two sets of growth increment data so obtained were entered, along with that obtained from MPA, into the appropriate routine of the Compleat ELEFAN package, and the latter used - along the lines suggested by Morgan (1987) - to estimate growth parameters by simultaneous analysis of length- frequency and growth increment data (Gayanilo et al. correct for the bias introduced by incomplete recruitment and gear were corrected using the methods described in Pauly (1986, 1987). As the probabilities of capture in the southern stock can be assumed to be similar to those in the northern/central stock, the probabilities of capture of Palomares et al. (1987), pertaining to the northern/central stock, were used for the and antirostrum. When observed with a compound microscope and reflected light against a dark background, a concentric pattern of bright (opaque) and dark (translucent The the were immersed in (glycerin). The presence of faint some cases the otolith interpretation. Otolith interpretation is a dual process consisting growth ring identification and interpretation and (2) determination of ring periodicity and of To assess the objectivity of the interpretation, the otoliths were read three times; level of obtained between an otolith reader in otolith G. Chdenas, IMARPE) and the periodicity the ring formation was made difficult by the thinness and transparency of the otolith margin. Some error might have occurred in the identification of the ring formed in the edge, principally when the opaque ring was in its initial when monthly percentage of hyaline in the otolith edge along the year, the formation of one hyaline ring per year was evident (Fig. 1). Under the light microscope, the otoliths showed a recurrent pattern of light and rings (Pannella 197 1) laid down with daily periodicity (Rojas de Mendiola and G6mez 1981). The increments were enumerated along the posterior otolith radius and the number of versus hyaline otolith were plotted (Fig. 2.). The correlation between both variables was not very high (r = 0.81). This might be due to the bias introduced by the long spawning period of anchoveta (up to 6 months) and to the failure of the light microscope in detecting the thin increments (0.5 - 0.7 pm) down iq the hyaline of fish older year (Morales-Nin 1988). Nevertheless, the age in dayyand in years for age 1 was close enough to validate the periodicity of the first of the the rings and it can be concluded, therefore, the by means the validated age-length key derived here. - O OLl I I 1 I I I I I I I 1 JFMAMJJASOND Month Fig. 1.

However, a fifth group appeared in June (Fig. 3.). The mean lengths obtained-for ages 0,1 and 2 were similar to the means from otolith reading. The mean length of age 3 was different, probably due to overlapping in the length-frequencies caused by the low growth rate of old fishes (Table 3). MPA showed the presence of young months of maximum spawning and clear seasonal growth oscillations in the age groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). When the length-frequency data were corrected for recruitment and gear selection, parameters obtained using ELEFAN I showed a clear change better fit (Fig. 4B) than without such correction (Fig. 4A, Table 6). The main change was the increase of K, which was higher (Pauly 1986) and hence, (Fig. 3) and converted into growth increments using MPA are given in Table 4, along with the two sets of growth increments derived from otoliths. The three sets of growth increment data were analyzed jointly with the length-frequency to improve the fit of the growth parameters. Two independent calculations were done for each set of growth increments, one using the uncorrected length-frequency data, and the on the length-frequency data corrected for incomplete recruitment and gear selection (see 5).

The Bhattacharya method, as incorporated in the MPA routine of the ELEFAN package, provided better results. The growth, parameters determined otolith reading and by the different programs for length-frequency analysis (ELEFAN I and ELEFAN when corrected. The growth performance index +' = logl&+210gloL (Pauly and Munro 1984; Moreau et d. 1986) for corrected L/F data was very close to the values reported for the northern/central stock of Peruvian anchoveta (Palornares et al. 1987, Fig. 15). Indeed, the mean of the 5 usable values = 2.665, precisely the value estimated for the late 1970s by Palomares et al. (1987, Fig. 5B). The ELEFAN I results were in the range of values reported for the northedcentral stock, but lower than the growth parameters for this stock in 1979. However, the growth parameters obtained from the corrected length-frequency were closer to the values reported for the northern/central stock (see Table 6 and Palomares et al. 1987). The results of the combined use of length-frequency analysis and growth suggested that the annual grow@ increments derived from otolith data (sets 2 and 3 in Table 4) gave a better fit than the increments obtained from MPA (set 1 in Table 4). The growth increments from otolith data weighted by abundance (set 2 in Table 4) gave a better fit than the more numerous, but shorter and more variable growth increments in set 3, where more weight is given to the interval between ages 0 and 1 than in the other two sets. This greater weight of the growth of the youngest fishes might be responsible for the when corrected length-frequency were used, compensated for (see Table 5). The correction for recruitment and gear selection of the length-frequency data strongly affected the K growth parameter estimation. The estimates of K obtained after the correction were much closer to the value obtained from otolith reading than without the correction (Table 6). In some simulations, the ELEFAN I program was found to overestimate Loo and underestimate K (Rosenberg and Beddington 1987; Hampton and Majkowski 1987). This effect appears to be overcome in the case of the Peruvian anchoveta after the length-frequency data were corrected for incomplete recruitment and gear selection. The estimates seasonal parameters (C and were and reached values closer to those of the northern/central stock (Palomares et al. 1987) and which also were in concordance with the environmental fluctuations (Bakun 1987). This is the first growth study of the southern Peruvian anchoveta stock and one of the first applications of a method for simultaneous analysis of length and age data derived from Morgan (1987). It may be premature to propose which of the growth parameter sets in Table 6 are the most accurate. Nevertheless, the suitability of otoliths for Peruvian anchoveta age determination has been demonstrated. Here, the match of our otolith-based parameter estimates with those of Aguayo (1979) from northern Chile is particularly notable, given that anchoveta from southern Peru and northern Chile are presumed to belong to the same stock. Also, a marked of the growth data for gear selection bias was evident. However, it may be necessary to continue studies of this type, including otolith data from more landing areas, to have a reliable estimates of anchoveta growth parameters. Also, it would be advisable to jointly study the growth of the Chilean and southern Peruvian components of the southern anchoveta stock.

Introduction This contribution presents series of anchoveta recruitment and mortality on a that is sufficiently small for capturing the rapid changes characterize this Monthly time series of various aspects of the population dynamics of anchoveta have been presented earlier (Palomares et al. 1987; Pauly et al. 1987a). contribution aims to: (to 1985) the previous time series, which covered the years 1953 to 1982; ii) include in the Contribution No. associated with the input values of baseline natural an important Population account predation. This far as estimation of statistics) Pauly and Tsukayama with the previous iterations, the biomass estimates here of available independent estimate of anchoveta off Peru obtained through and methods. Rather, (MJ results compatible with the independent biomass estimates. Materials The data used for this analysis largely with those used in Pauly et al. (1987a). However, more information was available at the time this analysis was performed. Among other things, we used Tables 1 to 5, covering the period 1983 to 1987, in addition to the catch and catch composition data from Tables 1 to 30 of Tsukayama and Palomares (1987), covering the period 1953 to 1982. As in the previous analysis, all monthly nominal catches were multiplied with a factor of 1.2 to account for unrecorded catches (Castillo and Mendo 1987). Total monthly withdrawals from the anchoveta population were computed as the sum of anchoveta consumption by the predators explicitly accounted for, plus the catch taken by the (Table 6). In addition to the bonito Pauly et al. 1987b); sea lions and fur seals (from Muck and Fuentes 1987), the anchoveta consumption estimates of mackerel and horse mackerel (from Muck and 1987), and hake (from Muck et al., this Table 1.

Los capturas de la pesqueria son capturas nom anchoveta considerados son jurel, bonito, caballa, merluza, guanay, piquero, pelicano, lobofino consume roughly the same taken of catch and consumption data. Tables 1 to 5 (and Tables 1 to 30 of Tsukayama and Palomares 1987) were raised to total withdrawals as follows: where RF is the raising factor for each month (i) and Ws(l) is the weight of the % catch composition data in month (i). The values of Ws(i) were computed as .. where Wi. is the mean weight of fish in class j of sample i, n the total number of length classes in that sampie, and f, the % frequency of class j in sample i. The mean weight of the fish via form: from where Ljl and Lj2 are the lower and upper limits of class (j), and which provides an unbiased estimate of the mean weight of a length class (Beyer 1987). The value of b used in equation (4) was set equal to 3 and the appropriate values of a for 1983-1987. Equations to were applied 403 times, for every month from January 1953 to July 1987, i.e., to the data in Tables 1 to 30 of Tsukayama and Palomares (1987), to the data in Tables 1 to 5, and to the samples interpolated to fill in gaps. linearly interpolated between adjacent months for all years with data gaps except for 1953 and 1983 for which data for the corresponding months of 1955 and 1984, respectively, were inserted. In a few cases, minimum catch estimates, set at 1 tonne, were inserted in the catch-at-length matrix to prevent division by zero errors. We expect these manipulations to have little impact on final results - at least when compared with the large impact of the parameter Mo, of which only approximate be VPA Beverton and Holt (1957) showed that the catch (Ci) from a population during a unit time period (i) is equal to the product of the population size at the beginning of the time period (Ni) times the fraction of the deaths caused by fishing, times the fraction total deaths, or: where Fi is the fishing mortality in the ith period, M is the natural mortality, generally assumed constant for all period, and Zi = Fi + M. The version of Beverton and Holt's catch equation which VPA and which can be derived from equation (5) by substituting for Ni the relationship: Given values Ci and an estimate of (7) can estimate (retroactively) the size of past cohorts (i.e., of groups of fish born at the same time and exposed to the same mortalities throughout their lives), given an estimate of Ni+ 1 from which to start the computation. Such estimate of Ni + 1 (expressing the size a cohort had before extinct) are usually called \"terminal populations\" (N,). Values of Nt can be obtained from: where C, is the terminal catch (i.e., the last catch taken from a cohort before it went extinct) and Ft is the terminal fishing mortality, i.e., the fishing pressure (here inclusive of C, (Mesnil 1980; Pauly 1984). The VPA is most important in the context of this to rapidly convergence from the guessed values of Nt (i.e., values of Ni is a function of the ratio of F to M. That is, the higher the proportion of the cohort is which ends up being withdrawn the fishery and eaten by horse mackerel, mackerel, seals, the more reliable the population estimates will be. This is the reason why we have accounted explicitly here for the anchoveta consumed by estimate of Three forms of VPA, all included in the ELEFAN 111 program, may be distinguished (Pauly and Tsukayama 1983; Gayanilo et al. 1988): i) which is the version originally proposed by Gulland (1965) and which Pope (1972) Analysis\"; VPA 111, which combines features of (i) and (ii) and which is documented in Pauly and Tsukayama (1983), in Pope et al. (p. 386-390) in Morgan and Pady (1987) and in Gayanilo et al. (1988). VPA I11 is a version of to each \"cohort\" and simply catches contained between two adjacent growth curves (see VIRTUAL POPULATION ANALYSIS 111 FILENAME : S66A71 COHORT # : 1 Loo : 20.5 cm K : 0.86 C : 0.36 WP I 0.62 M :2 Ft : 2 Lr : 3.75 cm 8 F 60 Month I (In tonnoe. 10'6) 1 60 Month showing monthly catch-at-length data scale) and one of the many monthly cohorts which can be superimposed on these data. The upper two panels show and fishing of anchoveta of length = 3.75-4.75 cm (from Pauly et aL 1987a). Fig. 1.

La poblacidn estimada correspondiente a1 mes 1 es una expresi6n del reclutamiento de la anchoveta de longitud Lr = 3.754.75 cm (de Pauly et al. 1987a). For such cohorts to really consist of fish recruited at the same time, the growth curves used for \"slicing up\" a cohort must be obviously as close to the true growth curve of that cohort as possible. This, among other Pauly (1982) and virtually all natural fish stocks, including those occurring in tropical waters, display seasonally oscillating growth (see also Palomares et al. 1987). In reality, not all fish of a given cohort have the same growth parameters, however, and it can be expected that some increasing between estimates of Mendelssohn 1987). growth curves used to \"slice cohorts\" were based on the version Bertalanffy Growth Function (VBGF) deqeloped by Pauly and Gaschiitz (1979), i.e., where L, is the length at age t, Lm the asymptotic length, K a growth constant, .to the \"age\" at which length is zero if the fish always grew according to the equation, C is a hmensionless constant expressing the amplitude of the growth oscillations and t, is the time (with respect to t = 0) at the beginning of a sinusoidal growth oscillation of a one-year period. For practical purposes, the estimation of t, was replaced by the estimation of a Winter Point (WP), defined as: which expresses (as a fraction of the year) the time during which growth is slowest. It should be mentioned here to an arbitrary birthdate that is set internally and not output by the program. For this reason, our estimates of growth parameters, biomass, recruitment, etc. are (10) age-at-length The VPA 111 routines of were applied to the available catch-at-length data, using for 1953 to 1982 the growth parameters in Table 3 of Palomares et al. (1987), new growth parameter estimates based on Tables 1 to 5 and on the ELEFAN I program (Pauly and David 1981; Gayanilo et al. 1988) for the years 1983 to 1987. The year-to-year differences in the values of these growth parameters caused a slight overlap of some \"cohorts\" (i.e, some of the catch data were used twice), and small gaps (i.e., some of the catch data were not included in any cohort). This source of error could have been avoided by using the same growth parameters the strong positive trend in anchoveta growth performance documented in Palomares et al. (1987). Estimation of Monthly Recruitment on basis into regular class intervals (the same intervals as those in which the catch data were originally grouped). The population estimates (in numbers) of the smallest class considered here (3.75 to 4.75 cm) are here defined as \"recruitment\" (of fish with mean length 4.25 cm). The population estimates (in numbers), by class, were then multiplied, length class (Fig. 2). The analyses for 1953 to 1982 were run with \"F,\" = 5 year-1, while those for 1983-1987 were run with \"F,\" = 2 year-1, because predation was not included as part of fishing \"mortality\" for the latter period. It is recalled that these values (a) pertain to Z-M (i.e., to the sum of true fishing mortality plus all sources of natural mortality represented by astinct predators and (b) that values of on final results, recruitment by (i)/anchoveta biomass (i) VIRTUAL POPULATION & F FILENAME : S66A71 MONTH : 5 YEAR : 1969 Loo r 20.5 cm K : 0.86 C : 0.36 WP t 0.62 Lr : tonne..

From these data, total mortality (2) can be estimated from: where m is the number of predator groups considered here, i.e., horse mackerel seals. Results and Discussion Estimate of Growth Parameters for the Years 1983 to 1987 The length-frequency data in Tables 1 to 5 had too many gaps to allow estimation of growth parameters for different cohorts or years. Therefore, we applied the ELEFAN I program to all data in Tables 1 to 5. This resulted in the following estimates: asymptotic length Loo = 20.3 cm (TL,); growth K = 0.8 year-1; amplitude of seasonal growth oscillation C = 0.27 and Winter Point (i.e., time of the year with lowest growth rate) WP = 0.62. al(1987). However, the = loglo K + 210gloL (Pauly 1979; Pauly and Munro 1984) for this period was 2.518, i.e., lower than estimated for the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Estimates of M, and Their Implication Table 7 and Fig. 4 document the values of M, obtained iteratively, i.e., by changing As be seen, the values of M, are extremely variable. Thus, our extrapolation of Mo = 0.6 year-1 for the period 1953 to 1963 is tentative. On the other hand, the overall level of Mo is lower, by a factor of about three, than the level of Mo in Pauly et al. (1987a). This is due to the explicit consideration of hake, whose now included the total withdrawals (Table 6). Indeed, if one assumes that the independent biomass estimates are accurate, then the drop to zero of the Mo values in the early 1970s suggests that total withdrawals were overestimated for that period. A similar decline was demonstrated by Pauly et al. (1987a) for the early 1970s, and shown to parallel independent (tagging) estimates of natural of new especially mackerel - M, estimates. Our VPA biomass estimates are, for the early 1970s, lower than the independent estimate (see Fig. 4) suggesting that, for that period, M, should have been negative, or more reasonably, that the withdrawals and the observed biomasses are mutually incompatible. One way to correct for this would be to identify (in a fourth iteration) a mechanism leading to of consumption III also Fig. 4). Tab& 7.

Estimates of Anchoveta Biomass and Recruitment, 1953 to 1985 Table 8 and Fig. 5 present our biomass estimates. Table 8 presents the data on a monthly basis, while Fig. 5, recalls them as smoothed series, emphasizing the interannual changes. time series quite faithfully reflects the known dynamics of the stock, inclusive of rapid decreases associated with El Niiio events. This also applies to the early period for which no independent biomass estimates are available (1953 to 1963) and whose overall level of biomass may be higher (or lower, depending on &) than indicated. The biomass estimates for the early 1970s are, as discussed above, slightly too high. This improves, however, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and indeed the near total collapse following summarized Table 8 5, but these are available on 5-114' MSDOS diskettes, along with our inputs and other data (see Appendix I). Fig. 6 presents our estimates of anchoveta recruitmenta for the period 1953 to 1985. As might be seen, these time series resemble those of biomass, which is not surprising for a resource in which 0.5 to 1.5 year old fish constitute the bulk of the biomass. Two important?eatures of this time series match those reported earlier by Pauly et al. (1987a). i.e.. , - ' i) the'increased within-year variability of from late 1950s probably an effect of the fact that the recruitment collapse of 197 1 appears to have occurred before the onset of the 1972-1973 El Nifio event, as also observed by Mendelssohn and (ii) implies that the El Niiio event of 1972-1973 least as conventionally defined, i.e., as temperature anomaly) cannot have been the cause for the collapse of the fishery. Natural and Fishing Mortality of Anchoveta, 1953 to 1985 Fig. 7 presents our estimates of predator-specific M values, our estimates of total M, of F and of Z = M + F. As might be seen, horse mackerel is by far the most important predator of anchoveta, followed (in the I. Table 8.

The least important predators were, on the other hand, hake and pinnipeds (at least as far as the stretch of Peruvian coast comprised between 4 and 14's is concerned). This is not surprising, as the bulk of Peruvian hake and $nnipeds are generally concentrated north and south of 4 - 14OS, respectively. Overall, natural mortality (baseline + predator-induced) shows no long-term trend, averaging 1.9 year-1 from 1953 to 1985, i.e., about two times the value of the growth parameter K, which was estimated by Palomares et al. (1987) to range from 0.6 to 1.3 year-1, with a mean of 0.9. Thus, M/K is in anchoveta of the order of 2 as is often the case in small fishes (Beverton and Holt 1959; Pauly 1980). The overall consistency of M, and its relationship with K, suggest that our values of Mo are probably not too far off the mark. Obviously, one could also emphasize the variability of M, which ranged from 0.8 year-1 in the mid 1970s to about 3 yew1 in the late 1970s. We cannot at present explain these changes; they may be real, or they may have to do with erroneous withdrawal estimates (especially with regard to the predation mackerel) or with biases in the due e.g. to post-collapse changes in the schooling patterns of anchoveta. Overall, we feel we have achieved the aims of the third iteration, i.e., to derive new estimates of anchoveta biomass and recruitment while simultaneously accounting for all of its important predators. We leave the refinement of our analyses to iteration\", pertaining to the the early 1970s. References Beverton, R.J.H. and S.J. Holt. 1957. On the dynamics of exploited fish populations. Fib Invest.

Introduction When dealing with the variability and collapse of fish stocks and fisheries, the specialized literature frequently points out incidence collapse amongst small pelagic fisheries may explain their to identified to contribute to the higher risk of collapse of these fish stocks and their (Ulltang 1976, 1980) and the South Afiican sardine (Shelton and Armstrong 1983). The existence of a similar type of relationship was also suspected on the Peruvian anchoveta that collapsed in the early 1970s, but no clear evidence to this respect was reported until anchoveta stock to a area, which caused an increase in the catchability allowed to higher while on a decimated (Csirke 1980). Although it occurred at a low abundance level, this did not provide enough evidence of a causal depensatory relationship between catchability coefficient and stock size because at that time the change in catchability was mostly associated with a major environmental factor. The increased catchability was particularly notorious late in 197 1 and early 1972, during the onset of the \"El Niiio\" event. The sequence events was caused by a combination of \"El NiiioM-related environmental conditions, see e.g., Muck, this vol.). Some discussion still goes on, however, on which of these factors are to be blamed the most, to what extent the collapse was avoidable, and if so, what needed to be done and when. Hopefully, knowing more about the behavior of the catchability coefficient may contribute to these questions. IMARPE-based international multidisciplinary project that led to the publication of the book edited by Pauly and Tsukayama (1987), provided both the stimulus and the additional sets of data and information needed to analyze the seasonal and to further catchability coefficient increased as stock size decreased. Material and Met hods The anchoveta stock referred to here is the one that occurs off northern-central Peru, from the northern end of the distribution at 4'30's (Jordh 1971), to approximately 14's. Before collapsing in the early 1970s, the stock in this area accounted for around 80% of the world catches of this species. Tagging, morphometric and other biological studies tend to support the idea that the anchoveta in this area belongs to a same unit stock, and indicated that it has similar and relatively uniform characteristics and mixes little with the anchoveta found further south, off southern Peru and northern Chile. The analyses in this paper are based on monthly data and estimates from 1960 to 1982, thus covering the most important years in the history of this fishery. Prior to 1960 the fishery was still in an early development phase, total catches represented a faftly small fraction of the stock and fishing effort data are not readily available for those years. No comparable set of data is at the moment available for the more recent years. Another, much stronger \"El Niiio\" event occurred in 1983-1984, which had a severe impact on the anchoveta stock and called for more drastic regulations and changes in the fishing fleet, gears and fishing operations, all aimed at reducing pressure on the depleted anchoveta stock and improving exploitation of sardines and other small pelagics which had increased in the mean time. This apparently made the collection of reliable anchoveta effort statistics more difficult for 1960-1982 (Table 1) were reported by Tsukayama and Palomares (1987). For the same stock Pauly et al. (1987) estimated the total biomass by size group at the beginning each at 8.25 cm in Pauly et al. (1987)). This stock is only exploited by Peruvian purse seiners, total fishing effort directed to the anchoveta stock by this fleet is presented in Table 3. The fishing effort estimates are those produced for, and used by, the Panels of Experts on Peruvian Anchoveta until 1973 (IMARPE 1970,1972,1973,1974), which have been updated Table 1.

The effort data series start in September 1960, when the newly created Marine Resources Research Institute (now the Peruvian Marine Institute - IMARPE) started to collect catch and effort No observations are available for some months in 1973,1977,1978 and 1982, when catches operations (e.g., surveys or fishing), when commercial operations were or were subject were provided. Total catches in small. per month (Table 4) was calculated by catch month by the mean of the exploited catchability here in the and Dickie (1964), and monthly stock. The to describe the variation of the catchability coefficient with stock size is that proposed by Fox (1974) and MacCall(1976), which has the form: where q is the B population size (mean biomass of the exploited stock in this case) and a and b are constants. In this model the catchability coefficient will B, giving rise to a relationship between the catch per unit of effort (0 and the stock size (B) of the form where the usual assumption that catchability remains constant allowing C/f to become a perfect index of abundance is fulfilled when b = 0. Increase in q with decreases in stock size are given by values of b smaller than 0, and in the limiting case where b = -1, C/f will remain constant, or may the fluctuations of the catchability coefficient in the Peruvian anchoveta fishery. This is particularly visible from 1960 through 1971 (Fig. 1) where, on the average, catchability was lowest during the austral winter (July-August) and was highest during the austral summer (November through March). Over this period the minimum recorded values are those corresponding to June 1967 and July, September and October during the 1965 \"El Nifio\" 0.0991,0.0253,0.0621 and 0.1 159 x 10-7, respectively). Maximum values of q during this period occurred prior to another \"El Nifio\" year, in November and December 197 1, and in March 1969 (q values of 1 .O993, 1 after the 1972 collapse of the anchoveta fishery. On the average, the catchability coefficient increased dramatically in seasons, but mid-spring (October-November) and the overall seasonality pattern when the whole 23 years of observations are taken into account (Fig. 2) where two the catchability values occur during and early higher April June in the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringem) fishery between 1960 and 1982.

Month Over the entire period, seasonality could account for up to f 30% change in the monthly catchability coefficient, which is relatively small in reported so The a seasonal not uncommon and the distribution and behavior of fish. If consistent from one year to another, seasonal patterns are relatively easy to handle and do not pose major problems in fish stock assessment and other related analysis. What are troublesome are year-to-year changes in the seasonal pattern, as occurred in the anchoveta fishery in the more recent years. This could have been influenced by the reduced stock sizes and the associated higher coefficients that, it will be shown below, prevailed after the collapse in 1972. This, however, does not provide a sufficient explanation for the change in seasonal patterns. A more analysis of the possible effects of some regulations adopted in the attempts to face the crisis in the anchoveta fishery would need to be undertaken before other natural causes be identified. During productive the north, the number of observations in some key periods, particularly in summer and winter when the newly recruited the spawning anchoveta were biomass (Fig. 3) a clear evidence that in the Peruvian anchoveta fishery, there was a steep increase in the decreasing stock function estimates for (= 0.286) and for the slope b (= -0.966) with a -1.17). The nonlinear regression method was assumed to produce the best estimates for prediction of q as a function of B. Besides an apparently better fit, it avoids the problems associated the log conversion account for the expected natural variability in q and B, but it is noted that it is very likely that the two variables are subject to an undetermined observational variability regression of Y/X on X (q = C/Bf on B, in this case) which, as it is well known, may give a significantly high correlation even if the X and Y values are random variables. This, however, should not invalidate the main conclusions of this Fig. Relationship between the catchability coefficient and the mean exploited and biomass, made each month, from 1960 to 1982, and the line has been fitted by a nonlinear regression procedure.

The apparent statistical significance of the high correlation coefficient between q and B should, however, be taken with great caution, and it should be recognized that, in this case, the variability and bias of the estimates are unknown, although they may be expected to be relatively small. With this warning in mind, one can then proceed to incorporate the parameters estimated above into equation (I), which, in the anchoveta fishery the expected variability of the catchability curve generated by this equation shown in Fig. 3 together with the observed values of q and B. The same equation has also been used to the months or values were missing (see in and 5), thus allowing comple- tion of the whole set of estimates of catch (C), biomass relatively low value of the slope (b, being very close to -1) and the model below resulting from equations (2) and (3) above: indicate that there is a very poor correspondence between the catch per unit of effort estimates used so far and the anchoveta stock size, and that except for stock sizes very close to 0, one should expect catch per unit of effort to remain constant, or to fluctuate independently of stock size. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 4, where the flat-topped curve generated with equation (4) diagram of observed monthly values of catch per unit of effort and anchoveta biomass. From this, it can be concluded that there is a very poor relationship between the anchoveta fishery, the catch per GRT-trip is useless as an index of abundance, and should not be applied within this by 1972 to abandon the use of fishing effort-based production models for the assessment of the Peruvian anchoveta. The strong depensatory relationship between q and B is, to a great extent, a consequence of the shoaling behavior through which, even if in low abundance, anchovies and other small pelagics would still tend to aggregate in shoals of a given size. This could, in theory, allow Fig. 4.

Anchoveta biomass (t x lo6) the catch rates to remain relatively high even while catching the last very few fish in a popula- tion, provided they are shoaling together and could be detected by the fleet. The fleet, on the other hand, has usually the capacity to increase its fishing power without this being reflected by an increase in nominal fishing effort. This has been particularly the case with the Peruvian anchoveta fishery. By using the GRT-trip as a unit, ad-hoc basis (i.e., abundance was low) to maintain catch rates. In fact, there are indications that as the stock size decreased, the duration of the average trip increased, and so did the time, spent searching, the number of hauls per trip, the cooperation amongst useful for monitoring and assessment and for future use it might worth the value the real abundance of the anchoveta stock. Log- book information on number of hauls, fishing hours per trip, searching for changes in distribution and local abundance. This could be achieved by stratifying catch and effort data by geographical subareas in such a way that, once weighed by the size of the subarea, catch per unit of effort values for each subarea could be added together. The size of these subareas should be kept as small as allowed by the basic information, and the grids of 30' latitude by 10 miles parallel distance from the coast (called \"areas isoparalitorales\" by IMARPE) introduced together with the log-books in use in the mid-1970s might be a reasonably starting point. One serious implication of the depensatory relationship represented by equation (3) is that the relationship between stock size, catch per unit of effort or equilibrium yield and fishing effort is no longer expected to be a straight line or a parabola, as is usually assumed in the simplest applications of fishing effort-based production models. If equations (1) and (2) are incorporated in the formulation of a simple production model, for values of b c 0 there is a range of values of fishing effort for which there are two equilibrium values of stock size (only one of which is stable), and the relationship between fishing effort and stock bending curves. The departure from the traditional straight lines or the parabola will be greater, and backward bending more pronounced as the absolute value of scatter diagrams of the relationship between estimated anchoveta catch anchoveta biomass with the corresponding values of fishing effort year, between 1960 and 1982 (values compiled from Tables 1,2 and 3). The same figures show simulated curves of the theoretical relationship biomass of virgin stock size) and fishing effort (Fig. 6) when the slope b = -0.97 is used in a depensatory version of a simple surplus production model. In the simulations mentioned above, a slope b = 0 will necessarily generate a perfect parabola in Fig. 5 and descending straight lines in Fig. 6 (more details about the other parameters used in the simulations follow). of depensatory relationship for fishery monitoring and management are that, fishing effort may be allowed to increase until the point at which the curve bends backwards is reached. From this point on, total catch will inevitably decrease fishing effort is reduced. One consequence is the switching of the system from an equilibrium path at a finite population level to an extinction path, from where the only way out, provided other conditions remain constant, is a massive reduction in fishing mortality. This critical point on of \"depensatory\" curve occurs (see also Csirke 1988) when the ratio between the mean biomass (B) and the virgin stock size (Boo) is: If b = -0.97 in the Peruvian anchoveta fishery, this critical point would have been reached with a mean biomass reduction stock size (B/Boo = 0.49).

However, it surely flipped down well below this level with the 1972-1973 \"El Niiio\". Although heavy fishing continued for some time after the collapse, overall fishing pressure on the anchoveta stock has diminished. The stock, however, failed to recover. This, together with the changes in other species mean biomass and presented in Fig. the data point corresponding to 1972 (mean 1972-1973 biomass) stands as a cut-off point for splitting the observations into two groups, each one of which could be fitted by a straight line - one for 1960- 1972, and the other for 1973- 1982.

Since in terms of surplus production modelling the intercepts in the biomass axis in Fig. 7 (a' and a\") correspond to the virgin stock size, one may have a rough indication of the relative magnitude of this change. It is also worth noting that the intercept of the two lines in the fishing mortality axis (c' = 2.10 and c\" = 2.28) almost coincide.

Abstract Following a brief review of the highly variable upwelling ecosystem, the hypothesis is presented that the anchoveta stock off Peru consists of a large number of local subpopulations of which each is genetically adapted to \"home\" to different upwelling plume, and to spawn during a specific period of the year. The impact of selective overexploitation of the most productive of these subgroups is in analogy to Pacific salmon and Atlanto- Scandian herring, and the implications for management and research are outlined. Resumen Luego de una breve revisi6n de las adaptaciones de la anchweta (Engraulis ringem) a su altamente variable ecosistema de afloramiento, se presenta la hip6tesis que el stock de anchoveta frente al Pen5 consiste de un gran nhero de subpoblaciones locales, cada una de las cuales esd genkticamente adaptada a su \"hogar\" en una pluma de afloramiento diferente y desovan durante un periodo especifico del aiio. Se discute el impact0 de la sobreexplotacih selectiva de 10s subgrups m8s productivos, en analogia con el salm6n del Pacifico y el arenque del Atlhtico-Escandiano y se esbozan las implicancias para su manejo e investigacih. Introduction The meteoric rise of the Peruvian anchoveta fishery been well documented. From miniscule catches prior to 1956-1957, the annual yield rose almost linearly to the end of 1970- 1971, whereupon the catches fell from about 10 to about 4 million tonnes (Valdivia 1978), while the corresponding stock sizes declined even more. A drop from the previous high population levels was already suspected in 1960 by Saetersdal et (1965) who developed a corrected index of catch/effort proportional to stock size and demonstrated a reduction of 50% between the 1959 and 1962 levels of abundance. In 1973, the total stock was estimated to be around 4 million tonnes while the catch varied from 2 to 3 million tonnes. In spite of the very small spawning stock in these years, there was a spectacular rise to biomass of 12 million tonnes in 1976 followed by an unprecedented crash to 1.9 million tonnes by early 1977, the lowest level of abundance recorded to the end of the 1970s (see Pauly and Palomares, this vol. and contributions in Pauly and Tsukayama 1987a). Many different offered explain these oscillations in biomass and the overall decline of the anchoveta stocks. However, they can be referred to one of two '~ditors' note: This is a slightly edited and updated version of a contribution presented at the USAKJSSR Conference Upwelling. Moscow. 8-18 1979, which had we because such the El Niiio of 1957,1965, 1969,1972 and 1976, have been linked causally to declines in abundance; and (ii) withdrawals by the fishery as the principal cause of reduced levels of anchoveta abundance and paper to third, alternative explanation and a synthesis of previous ones. The basic premise is that the genetic structure of the anchoveta population has been altered by sustained removals of about 10 million tonnes annually during the first half of the 1960s. Perturbations of the environment, therefore, now affect the stock in a different manner than prior to the onset of the fishery. It has been known for sometime that stressed clupeoid populations signal this by violent and rapid fluctuations in numbers concomitant with alterations of other vital parameters (Murphy 1973). The mechanism whereby this is effected is the selective removal of fish peaks of such as stating the or semi-independence of a large number of subgroups constituting the overall anchoveta population. The analogy to that for anadromous salmonid species in the North Pacific, i.e., based on a racial stock concept and home stream theory. The Peruvian Stock of Anchoveta The range of distribution of Engraulis ringens extends from a almost 4,000 km. The offshore distribution varies not only with the season but also with the configuration of the continental shelf and its width. The edge of the shelf may be placed at 200 m isobathyline. But even within this very narrow coastal shelf, most of the anchoveta are found within 60 km off the coast, and the bulk of the commercial catch have been made in the past within 10 km off the coast. The temperature regime varies less than what wide geographic range, primarily due to the upwelling along the Eastern Boundary Current which flushes the shoreline with waters of 16\u00b0C thereabouts. Temperature limits can be set at 14\"- lg\u00b0C, but they are by no means well defined and can be exceeded, especially in anchoveta's by temperature, a vertical set by the oxygen content. Below 40 meters depth on the concentrations of anchoveta below 40 m or in waters with 2 ml/02/1. Most schools have been detected in depths from 20 to 40 m (Villanueva 1970). The heaviest concentrations of anchoveta are found outside northern and central Peru. In the north, the abundance drops off quickly while in the south, it trails off gradually (Pauly and Tsukayama 1987b). gradients occur. The can either be done visually from echograms, as was done from 1964 to 1972 or thereafter from integrated echo outputs. An example is given in Fig. 1 (left map), which is based on charts from Johannesson and Robles (1977). The mapping was done in February during the austral summer spawning season and clearly indicates the presence isolated density centra. here as manifesting the existence of distinct spawning season. the prevailing stock concept which postulates few but on the Chilean anchoveta into a northern and a southern group. Jordan (1963) failed to detect any differences in the population along the entire Peruvian coast. Tsukayama (1966) found that the average number of gill rakers for fish caught at Chimbote in the north differed from that established for samples from Mollendo in the south. Likewise, Rojas de Mendiola (197 1) found that length of the intestine relative to body northern than February July Chancay 4 calla0 Med~urn density Tambo de Mora C Fig. 1.

This in itself may point to a heavier component of zooplankton in the diet of the southern groups of anchoveta (see Pauly et al., this vol.). However, for these large population units to represent a common gene pool, there must be free interchange of individuals and no reproductive barriers, neither spatial nor Some tagging experiments suggest rather long and rapid migrations, but there is a question as to what extent anchoveta tagged with an internal magnetic tag exhibit their relocation occur during El Niiio events when the warm water from the north leaves the fish only two choices, either to to migrate south. Valdivia (1978) reports that large numbers of anchoveta in 1972 were found only south of 10\"s in March, south of 12's in April and finally south of 15's in the beginning of May. But a rapid southward retreat of this type does not guarantee that the relocated fish will successfully spawn in their new environment. The opposite is a more likely event: independence of population units can be identified and established as well from spawning time as from meristic characters. Anchoveta entire year, spawning occurs for eight or nine months, from July to March. Within this time span, one can identify two periods, one during the austral from September a less intense spawning period in January-February (Senocak et al., this vol.). It has been claimed by Paulik (1970) that the same anchoveta can spawn both in spring and, six months later, in the summer. However, there is no direct evidence to substantiate thisa. '~ditors' note: this was a valid point when the original version of this paper was written. By now, evidence to substantiate this is available (see references in Pauly and Soriano 1987). However, the author's main point is not affected by this. Rather, the fact that the spring spawners are consistently two or more times more abundant than the summer spawners testifies to the independence of these two spawning units. In the catches made during or shortly the mature fish dominate while the immature fish represent the strongest group in catches after the summer spawning. On the average, there must be factors or conditions during the spring spawning which render this the most successful of the two. In the course of the evolutionary this must then eventually manifest itself genetically. This process has been going the last 11,000-12,000 years. Studies of sediment cores from a shelf region of 14's turned up anchoveta scales in all scales of hake. In contrast, sardine scales and relatively time periods. No periodicity or regular patterns for 16% and sardines less than 2%. of (DeVries 1979; DeVries and Pearcy 1982). During this the anchoveta has maintained itself in the coastal waters. If scale abundance reflect changes in population size, there would be of the 15, based on a time scale of several centuries. No finer solution was possible, and no statements can be made regarding annual or short-term variability, such as observed during the last decade where changes have been of the order 1: 10. Originally, the Eastern Boundary Current was thought of as a rather stable environment. However, intensive studies by the Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE), under the US Coastal Ecosystem Upwelling Analysis Program (CUEA), and by expeditions from the USSR, the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada and other countries, have shattered this concept. The strength of upwelling is not only governed by the wind force, but also by the deep undercurrent (Smith 1978). El Niiio events are occurring more previously believed (Quinn et al. 1978). However, irrespective of the cause and nature of the perturbations, the anchoveta has maintained carry an population after a temporary environmental setback. This becomes more critical for the anchoveta than for the hake: the former has an average life span of perhaps two years, while it is double or more for hake. One can see this in the scale deposit where number of hake scales has varied much less than that for the anchoveta over the last ten thousand years. Several types of evolutionary strategies can be suggested. One would be the development of extremely wide tolerance limits for the physical and chemical factors of the environment as well as high survival rates of different life stages. Another mechanism, suggested by Walsh (1978), is that marine communities may respond to climatic oscillations by a relocation of their center of abundance. However, there is a growing body of evidence, still largely circumstantial, that a population of fish consists such as The function of many independent or semi-independent units, many of which are small and perhaps should be termed plus or minus deviants from the strong central groups, is that of buffering against perturbations of the environment. An analogy can be made with a salmon population where the spawning colonies are visible and can be identified in the time-space domain even though they cannot easily, or not at all, be separated by their meristic characters alone. But even within a geographically confined Salmon began to ascend the various streams and river systems along the perimeter of the north Pacific Ocean as soon as the glaciers started to recede, some 12,000-13,000 years ago. (This corresponds to about the same time that the anchoveta has occupied the Peruvian upwelling system.) In due course, the genus into \"races\" in the ocean from meristic or serological characters has met with limited the spawning grounds. Another distinguishing feature is the time of spawning. Thompson (195 1) was perhaps the first to decisively point out that the usually bell-shaped time curve or ascendance into a best adapted to the environmental conditions. If this were not so and reproduction was equally successful at all times during a year, the abundance curve would be a horizontal line. In time, the phenotypically differing units have assumed independence by karyotypic selection. Time of spawning as an inherited character has been demonstrated on several occasions by transplantation experiments. This of other factors, such as invariant, annual variability is buffered by the presence of plus or minus deviants. By and large, the phenological sequence of events is tightly or loosely coupled, depending upon the variability of to other aquatic organisms, the variance for salmon \"races\" is small, which is to be expected in its high latitude environments with pronounced seasdnal successions. Conversely, the diversity of the or minus deviants from the mean, i.e., their distance in standard deviation units, expresses the variability of the environment and of the niche to which an organism has adapted itself. If now a \"race\" commercial the brunt of fishing will be directed for purely economic reasons - toward the fish belonging to the peak of the abundance curve. This in turn causes a selective removal of constituents of the group the highest reproductive potential. If this process is continued long enough, the net result is a very lowered production. The history of various fisheries provides magnificent examples. In the Columbia River, the peak abundance curve was July, as seen in 1876 when a gill net fishery commenced (Fig. 2). The heart of this run was removed by the fishery which preferred to operate in July, the month with the best summer weather and the highest abundance of fish. The central part of the run was eventually fished out. The early and late segments of the runs have Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Fig. 2. Seasonal changes of salmon (modified from Thompson 1951). A.

Another example is the Karluk River in Alaska where the successive decline of the total stock can be traced very well from the catch records combined with weir counts of escapement. Again, the productive middle part of the bell-shaped abundance curve was destroyed by the fishery (Thompson 1951). The important point is that in both of these two cases, the early or late segments have not increased beyond their historical selective fishing pressure continues, not only will the center part of the run diminish, but eventually the plus and minus deviants will diminish because of their low reproductive potential. This is analogous to a fishery of a mixed stock where the marginal groups eventually succumb (Paulik et al. 1967). The end result is that eventually the continuous distribution pattern is broken and the fish appear in geographically isolated small groups with a low net production. The important question is: Can this stock concept be applied to fishes? Superficially, there seems to decompose a marine stock, such as herring, into a collection of independent subgroups. Devold (1963) reported that the spawning time of stock of herring changed from November to December in 1890 to March to April in 1960 (Fig. 3). He estimated this progressive delay as a few days per year. Over a sufficiently long period of time, this would have the effect of retarding peak spawning time.

Another interpretation is that the original spawning group of a of units peaking successively from November to March. an unrestricted fishery will hit the first segments hardest, they would the first to go. when the cease to the catch. The fishery would thus turn to the next one and so on with a net result of an apparent shift in peak spawning time as observed in the case of the Atlanto-Scandian stocks of herring. In order for the homing and spawning time concept to be applicable to the anchoveta, several assumptions must be met. First, there must be a series of independent upwelling plume with stability to be that they \"home\" to water masses or an environment of a certain characteristic with regard to water velocities along all three coordinates, temperature regime, salinity distribution to mention some of the obvious attributes. Next, the fish must be able to maintain themselves in their \"home\". Also, there must be a distinction in time of spawning (which should be rather short). Finally, the net must a discontinuous distribution pattern. These aspects will be analyzed next and illustrated with some data generated during the JOINT II expediti6ns in 1976- 1977. Behavior of Anchoveta in an Upwelling Area CHARACTERISTICS OF AN UPWELLING AREA Upwelling is a universal feature along the entire Peruvian coast, but it occurs well- areas are recognized, such as the San Juan area, the Callao region and off Chimbote, to mention some. But inside each area, there are a number of plume structures. Two placed in the San Juan region are located about 50 km apart. Upwelled water is recognized to the water masses (Fig. 4). The subsequent events after upwelled water reaches the Fig. 4.

But generally, the surface water is subjected to an equatorial flow along the coast of 11-12 cm/s velocity and an offshore component vector is therefore veering away from the coast with a velocity of 12 km/day. As the surface water flows away from the coast, the temperature rises to 18O-l9OC, partly due to heating nitrate by the phytoplankters; might deepen the layer and add more nitrate to the system. Thus we can expect the greatest phytoplankton production to be re-enter the upwelling area since at a depth ranging from 20 to 100 m, there is a counter current in almost opposite direction to the surface flow with velocities ranging 5 to 10 km/day (Fig. 5).

I If one were to draw successional cycles, zooplankters would follow by the excretion of the zooplankter is by the location and bottom topography, but the wind is the prime mover of the plume upwelling and determines both its strength and noted that the location of plumes may shift; but with the time scale on which anchoveta operates, the individual events are of lesser importance. Only the integrated picture or mean parameters become the important ones. Hence, it is but necessary to define a generalized plume upwelling locations. However, certain degree of constancy of an environment is required to which the fish can adapt itself and \"home\" to. A first requisite is that the fish can maintain themselves in a structure of this type with a minimum of expended energy. Diel behavior seems to closed be established in a changing current system. ACOUSTIC ASSESSMENT OF NEKTON Echo mapping of the Peruvian anchoveta and other members of the nekton community began in 1964 with a sharing or blackening of the echograms (Villanueva 1970). A next major step was absolute quantification through analog integration of the signals over a given distance, such over depth interval. A further advance was the introduction of which permitted a resolution down to 1-m depth intervals and a time interval down to one single transmission. The latter feature proved to be one of the most useful in deter- mining the density of a V-fin towed at the side of the ship extended from a yard arm and with a transducer towed about 1 1/2-2 m below the surface. In the case of hull-mounted transducers, the dead surface space is usually about 5 m or more. The echosounder was a SIMRAD EK 120 and signals were either stored on tape or pro- cessed in real time onboard with a PDP 11/10 computer with a basic output after 1- or 5-minute integration by 14 continuous depth zones down to 60 m depth. The data expressed in gm-3 were stored on could recombined by appropriate computer programs to give densities by volume or by surface unit area. DIEL FEEDING OF THE ANCHOVETA It has been known for along time that anchoveta possess a pronounced (Pauly when the fish formed the most dense schools and the anchoveta was most easily c~ptured. Diel behavior in the JOINT-I1 area was a square on the shelf with sides one nautical mile long in an area with a concentration of fish. Transecting was continued for 18- 24 hours to include the time before sunset, the night and daybreak to noon. Total biomass was expressed as gIm2 surface and output every minute. If the anchoveta were schooling, this would show up as a few adjacent points with high biomass estimates followed would apart form layers where the individual fish would be filtering while cruising along, and adjacent estimates would all be of approximately the same order. This is well illustrated in Fig. 6 showing the contrast between night and day. Basically, the schools were dissolved at onset of dusk and the anchoveta persisted during day except that the schools started to break apart in the afternoon. One direct interpretation is to see the dense school a feeding during the nighttime. More important in this connection is the change in depth distribution, which was explored by using night and day obtained area mainly anchoveta were insonified. The computer output was, in this case, the average density over one nautical mile expressed in gm-3 for the depth in to make all observations directly comparable. The basic pattern is for the greatest density to be close to the surface at night or at least above 20 m depth. At daybreak when the forming, the mean density distribution is normally 20 m. The ecological importance is immediate. As mentioned earlier, the 20 m depth forms the boundary line between the offshore in the top layer and onshore poleward subsurface current.

The oxygen distribution this year prevented the fish from descending deeper than 20 m without a provisional oxygen limit of 2 ml/l. The depth distribution in this year bears this out, with no anchoveta registered below 20 m (Fig. 7). To aggravate the situation, the high surface temperature forced 18-20\u00b0C. of energy required to maintain a position in the upper 20 m close to shore or basically within the 50 m contour line. The alternative could be to drift away from shore with the Ekrnan drift and literally become lost at sea. Both alternatives probably were realized and contributed to the low point of the biomass of anchoveta in 1977. But in general, the normal behavior pattern of the anchoveta will serve to maintain its position in a geographically restricted upwelling system, which clearly is conducive to the development of a \"homing\" tendency. Even more conclusive evidence can be derived from changes in distributional pattern of the anchoveta population which has been subjected stress of sustained and intensive commercial exploitation. RECENT CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANCHOVETA The general description of the range of anchoveta is one of a continuous distribution from 5's to 42OS, but within the heaviest distribution from 6's 17's there exist definite and very sharp density gradients. This could be surmised from the location are given by Johannesson and Robles (1977), and their data are summarized in Fig. 1, left side. Although the distribution is almost continuous, there are some very distinct and well-defined high density areas. Schematically, this can be illustrated in Fig. 8a where a series of independent or semi-independent populations overlap and produce an apparent continuous distribution. If effect of fishing is removal of the best adapted and most productive and therefore, most numerous spawners as alluded to in the case of the salmon, the net result of the rapidly diminishing populations will be a discontinuous distribution with isolated cells or pockets of fish, as illustrated in Fig. 8b. This appears to be very much the case as illustrated by the distribution map produced in March/April of 1977 (Fig. 1, right side). But in addition to the very disjointed distribution, the very striking fact is that the locations where fish were found largely corresponds to the places where a processing facility developed in the early days of the fishery and presumably where the supply of fish was best and most consistent. In addition to the geographical separation, there is also a temporal separation. Historically, there have always been two spawning populations, one consisting of spring spawners, which spawn in September-October and one group of summer spawners in February-March. The strength of the former was usually twice to thrice that of the latter (see Senocak et al., this vol.). They also differed in age composition with the total biomass in September to be dominated by mature fish. The reverse was true for the summer spawners where the immature fish, spawned six months earlier and now with a length of less than 11 cm, dominated the catch. au = Eastward, =Northward components.

Representacibn esquema'tica de las amplitudes de urn serie de (A) (sub) stock inexplotados de anchoveta peruana y (B) (sub) stocb explotados y fatigados de la misrna especie (ver texto). The mere fact that these differences persist year after year provides the basis which in time will lead to independent groups. One consequence is that the anchoveta basically has one spawning season per year, either in early spring or late summer. In this respect, there has only been an expansion in the time basis. Earlier, the curve of abundance for a group was taken to reflect differences in survival rate with time. The same argument can be extended to the two principal groups of spawners. The fact that anchoveta can spawn during the entire year, and regularly over an eight-to-nine-month period, does not detract from this argument. There are two time periods when survival is better than the average, and one is decidedly the better one of the two. If one inquires into the function of the plus and minus deviants, one answer is that they buffer against adversities and perturbation of the environment. The year 1972173 may be taken as an example when temperatures rose above average for a long time, almost an entire year. As a result, the phenological events of spring spawners were not synchronized and only the summer spawners reproduced successfully (Fig. 9). Anchoveta and Salmon - a Comparison An argument has been advanced that the structure of salmon runs and the conduct and salmon \"races\" have some similarity to and validity for anchoveta populations. But the latter case these are more vague; areas overlap and events are superimposed. Ecological efficiency is an attribute which in the evolutionary process demands its price in a closely-knit coupling to an environment. It can only be reached in populations whose environments possess some stability or where the animals have acquired some measure of independence from the environment. Resilience thus becomes a quantity related to the I I I I I I I I Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Month Fig. 9.

The Peruvian upwelling system is far from stable. The occurrence of El Niiio is a common event, although variable in strength and (Bohle-Carbonell, this vol.). progress seems that more profound water quality are by the both equatorial flow components. Nevertheless, throughout its history during the last 12,000 years, the anchoveta population in Peru has maintained itself. Some regulatory mechanisms are obvious: separate spring and summer spawners, each group again broken down in many units. The main question is how much interchange there is between these units. Clearly, in the case of the salmon, progressed further and the population units have reached a high degree of independence. But even within the various members of the genus Oncorhynchus we see different straying. The which reproduction is usually the a becomes a governing factor. The contention of this paper is that the same principles apply to anchoveta but in a more diffuse form. Thus, the wholesale migration south in 1972 described Valdivia (1978) did not result in a successful spawning in the new environment (if spawning took place at all). But clearly, some place between the same area. Basically, one must adopt the view that marine populations of fish have not achieved the same degree adaptation as anadromous species; however, same structural effect of the fishery remains largely the same. Accordingly then, the decline of the Peruvian stock of anchoveta was accelerated by not only the removal of a large biomass of spawners, but perhaps more, by the 1972-1973 and 1976-1977, leading, ultimately, to the depressed state of the population today. An inescapable corollary is that the object of management is not to define a \"maximum sustainable yield\" or an necessary spawning population. by no means a fixed quantity but varies according to the status of the environment and the risk the manager is willing to take. In addition to numbers, the manager must prescribe the characteristics of the fish to be preserved with an emphasis on securing these from the central or most abundant part of the spawning population in each upwelling area. The future course of fishery science possibly will not be to define management principles but to describe the evolutionary process which enables of the nekton to occupy various ecological While physical be described rather easily various observable parameters, the independence of units, such as within the Peruvian anchoveta stock, defies the usual approaches. The open question is how the members of a unit recognize an environment essentially which is an imprinting process. In the case (Nordeng 1971). But the amount of chemical substances is so minute that common analytical tools do not suffice. In most cases, this phenomenon must be studied indirectIy by long-term monitoring of both the physical environment and the nekton groups occupying this environment.

Introduction An apparent dependence of growth on population density is a common finding in studies of the dynamics of natural fish populations (e.g., Beverton and Holt case of this of mechanism might really be acting is not clear. For example, Lasker (1970) estimated that peak as the population declined In the similar eastern ocean boundary upwelling ecosystem off Northwest Africa, Mathisen et al. (1978) compared food consumption to food production. Results suggested that food does not directly control the size of adult or recruited fish populations. Mathisen et al. cited Gulland (1971), Murphy (1973) and Steele (1974) as having questioned food limitation as a control for adult fish \"since in those cases where fish have been reduced to a low level through fishing, the structure and size of the next lower trophic level has not changed drastically\". In the case of the Peru Current upwelling system, Lasker (1989) estimates that the anchoveta popula- tion, at a pre-collapse biomass level of 20 million t, would consume about one-fourth of the primary production of Since anchoveta obviously will consume some quantity of secondary production, the question as to whether it may at times be limited by its food supply is unanswered. Indeed, Palomares et al. (1987) found a significant correlation between growth performance and population biomass of Peruvian anchoveta over the period 1954-1982. They discussed three different effects which might competition for food resources and predation by anchoveta, vis h vis less nutritious mechanisms a of regional-scale a exploitation. The purpose of this chapter is to point out that plausible alternative mechanisms exist which do not necessarily imply will be addressed: school and (2) effects of size-dependent predation. These may lead to different interpretations of evidence of density-dependent growth with respect to resilience the Fish School Geometry As schools vary diameter, they may also vary correspondingly in vertical thickness, i.e., large schools may be thicker in vertical dimension than small schools. To the extent that school thickness may vary in rough proportion to diameter, the aspects the school such as the surface area encompassing the volume occupied by the school or the cross-sectional area swept by school movement, will vary as the second power of 6 (where 6 = school diameter or other appropriate characteristic length scale). However, the volume of the school, therefore, the number of individual fish contained, will vary as the third power of 6. Thus, school surface area cross-sectional area swept OC OC 1 - ... 1) school volume no. of individuals in school 6 The consequence of expression (1) is that as 6 (i.e., school size) increases, the average supply per individual within the school of food and other substances (e.g., replenished dissolved oxygen where concentration may have been depleted by respiration) that must enter the school interior through the cross-sectional area swept by a moving school (or diffused through the outer surface area of a stationary school) decreases in proportion to 6-1. Thus, a fish in a larger school (of size - 61) must, in comparison to a fish in a smaller school (of size - &), either accept an average food ration which is smaller by the factor &,#j1 (and to the extent that a school may be capable of depleting the oxygen within the water volume occupied, additional of (1979) discussed this effect as a factor school size of the Antarctic krill Eup hausia superba. Of course, it is possible that large schools are strictly limited in the vertical dimension by external constraints (water column structure, total water depth in shallow areas, vertical distribution of food organisms, etc.). In the case of a flattened school shape of constant vertical dimension, the volume and the surface area of a school vary nearly in direct proportion. Even so, the ratio of cross sectional area swept to the volume of a moving school would continue to vary as 6-1 so long as both horizontal dimensions tend to increase or decrease together (i.e., excluding the case where the length of the school axis parallel to its motion remains constant while school width, normal to the direction of motion, increases.) Actually, Mais (1974) finds seasonal, diurnal, topography) tendencies school sizes and for somewhat anchovy California tend to be greater than those of smaller schools. However, one finds little information in the literature on school thickness in relation to school diameter; this may indicate a lack of appreciation of the potential importance of school surface to volume ratios with respect to nutrition and metabolism of schooling of food patches, and opportunities for group learning. In any case, it clear that for species with pronounced schooling behavior, groups increase their probability of survival and successful their genetic material by joining with other conspecific groups of similar body size that be in the depends on the rate of encounter with other individuals or schools; that is, all other factors school per unit time -c PC ... 2) where P is the size of the population, and the exponent c population size; that entire population would tend to aggregate into a few very large schools, whereas large numbers of disjoint schools is the observed situation. This implies that, while the tendency for aggregation must dominate when the school given school time = F(N) where F(N) is some increasing function of N (N = number of individuals in a school), at least over an observed range of school sizes. Combining expressions (2) and (3) yields where k is the constant of proportionality implied by expression (2). Using a formulation equivalent to Anderson assumptions that the number leaving was linearly proportional to N (i.e., F(N) = K N, where K is a constant) and that the number joining (Wc) was constant with time. He added stochastic terms to the entrance and exit rates and to the relationship of N to 6. He thereby constructed a model that reproduced the frequency distribution of pelagic fish school diameters off Southern California reported by Smith (1970). The question of the form of F(N) ig an important one. There must be some ultimate limiting point at which the school size becomes too large for its members to meet their metabolic requirements. Upon growing to that point, it would seem that the school must become unstable and break apart. However, Smith (1981) suggest that is only metabolic limit. Apparently, that point. The hypothesis that individuals altruistically leave the school when they perceive that it is becoming too large for peak efficiency appears to be untenable. A principle of behavioral ecology states that animals do not sacrifice their own fitness for the good of their group that the optimum group size is unstable and that group sizes in natural systems considerably larger than optimal size. This is because individuals in a group (even an oversized group), than on their own. Pitcher (1986) draws the analogy to an overcapitalized fishery in which individuals will not withdraw in order to increase the profit of those remaining in the fishery as long as they themselves have not reached the point of zero profit. The effect of natural selection is to ensure that individual fish within a school maximize the probability of successfully propagating their own genetic material relative to that of other individuals in the school. Natural selection would thus act to this for is difficult to envision behavioral responses that would induce exit to polarized movements in different directions by different segments of a school such that fish in between must relinquish their attraction to one of the segments to stay with the other. The two segments could thereby lose contact, thus splitting related might occur when two separate patches are of Feeding behavior would attract school members to one or the other of the food patches, leading to a similar loss of contact between school segments (Paul E. Smith, pers. comm.). Also, it is although Pitcher (1986) emphasizes that the observed tendency under attack is for increased school cohesiveness. In these cases, the average number of fish leaving a school per unit time should, on average, be proportional to the total number in the school at the time a fragmentation occurs; i.e., F(N) = K N (where K is a constant of proportionality), as assumed by Anderson (1981). With this substitution, the equilibrium solution to equation (4) is WC = K N, or k equilibrium school size = = (x) PC ... 5) Equation (5) predicts average school size will population size.) In fact, even k and K are not constants, the two premises: (i) that the rate of entry into a school increases with population size, and (ii) that the rate of leaving the school increases with school size, must to population such an equilibgum. Mais (1974) found that the discrete daytime schools of northern anchovies off California tended to break up into scattering layers atnight. This is in accord with the common pattern for clupeoids (Blaxter and Hunter 1982). This particular type of shift in school size and character does not necessarily imply altruism by individuals, but merely an alteration and cohesion due to changes in visual acuity with the drastic day-night change in light. Different values of k and F(N) in equation day or night conditions. Mais also found that the distribution result to variations in attption to the school (i.e., in k) or in cohesiveness (i.e., in F(N)) leading to seasonal variation canyons or escarpments. this case, the topographic features could in themselves attract fish (i.e., act to effectively increase k on a very local scale) and provide points of orientation which could counteract the tendency for school fragmentation as corresponding increase in N. In all of these cases, equation (4) could separately apply to each diurnal, seasonal, or local situation, with the net integrated that average school the habitat would increase with population size. Applicability to the Anchoveta (1971) notes that anchoveta form large, dense schools during the daylight hours which break up at night into smaller feeding schools. This may be a simplification of a more complex situation similar to that described by Mais (1974) for the northern anchovy. However, it be useful to discuss the this basis. In that case, the considerations presented above could act on both scales: (i) in the formation of the large daytime schools from a background \"population\" of feeding schools, and (ii) in the determination of the size distribution of nighttime feeding schools from the background population of individuals. In both cases, the effective value of P in equation (4) could depend population size and the considerations presented above could thereby hold. the case of food ration, the nighttime case seems to be of vertical dimension with horizontal dimension is most likely. In a tank experiment wherein relatively than did schools of comm.) has be less polarized in their behavior and more apt to make excursions from the main school trajectory in order to take particles lying outside of therefore, apt to get less ration per individual. In the case of oxygen supply, the large densely-packed daytime resting taken during the feeding period (Pauly 198 1). This writer is aware of no measurements of oxygen depletion taken at sea within reduction of dissolved all schools meqsured. The magnitude of the reduction correlated with school size, ranging up to 29% (in a school of size 6 = 150 m). Actual values of the reduction were in the range of 0.12-0.40 mg L-I for \"small\" (6 = 4-9 schools, 0.50-0.80 mg L-I for \"medium\" (6 = 18-30 m) schools, and 0.70-2.10 mg L-I for \"large\" (6 = 75-300 m) schools. Typical separation between fish within daytime anchoveta schools is of the order of one fish length (Jordan 197 1) and so comparable reductions in dissolved oxygen concentration seem possible for large anchoveta schools. Brett (1979), in experiments with different fish species, found that a drop of dissolved oxygen of one mg L-1 causes in their food supply. In many systems the predators have access to alternative prey. Switching of predation pressure to these alternate food resources is one likely response to population decline of a major prey species. But, of the enormous size of anchoveta population to the 1971172 collapse , and its corresponding within the opportunities for switching to alternative prey during the decline of the anchoveta might have than more sea birds, marine mammals, etc., with strong affinities, may have derive by extracting an increased share of a declining On the other hand, predator populations that habitually migrate to exploit spatially separate food bases may not have to experience population declines due to decline in one of its major food bases. For example, Muck and anchoveta throughout the entire era of high anchoveta biomass and the more recent era of lowered biomass. These fish exploit both the nearshore habitat of the anchoveta and the opportunistic of mackerel and horse mackerel over the entire period high substantial increase in natural predation pressure on the anchoveta, per unit anchoveta biomass, since the decline. If, as suggested in the mortality is be in both larval (Hunter 1971; Folkvord and Hunter 1986; Miller et (Parker 197 1; Healy 1982; successful recruitment. Any larva or juvenile which by chance gets access to a better ration or other favorable growth series of size increments between recruitment, with individuals make up a reduced portion of the survivorship as age increases. The mode of the distribution of size at age is shifted toward identical. half of the aquaria, three larger salmon were introduced as predators; the other half were kept predation-free as controls. After allowing time for the populations by predation to measured. increased growth 0.3-0.5% in have been amplified. In such case, there is no need for alteration of actual growth rates to have occurred in order to produce the evidence of density-dependent growth in anchoveta reported by Palomares et al. (1987).

It has the comforting implication appear to eating up its at high biomass, there must be substantial surplus production and associated compensatory resilience to class of mechanisms also has compensatory implications, but does not imply, as does the first, that the population at high biomass may be nearing the limit of the carrying-capacity of its habitat. The third class of hypothetical mechanisms is not size, the relationship of vertical thickness to horizontal scale is a crucial aspect. To the extent that vertical and horizontal aspects may functionally linked, consequences 1982) an adaptation to avoid some of these consequences. Information on this functional linkage is surprisingly absent in literature, although it would seem not difficult to acquire. If there is a \"moral\" to this contribution, it illustrates the need for an \"integrated ecosystem\" view of marine resource population dynamics. We have seen the possibilities of three different interpretations of the same evidence, each with crucial, but highly differing, implications to stock preservation. To a fisheries oceanographer, the situation feels familiar. It is not very different from the dilemma faced in attempts to empirically mechanisms one finds, in the case, that the available time series relating to result information is simply too limited to empirically differentiate among the possibilities. How can we integrate and utilize infomation on all the various scales, both spatial and temporal, that can be accessed. For example, this contribution indicates occurring on the scale of the school (for that matter on perhaps two school scales, both of the nighttime \"feeding\" school and of the daytime \"rest- ing\" school), as well as on as to be capable of utilizing all the information in the rich patterns of variation within years, and both within and among regions (Bakun, in press). The cooperative assembly and integrative analysis of various types of data reported in this volume and in the earlier companion volume (Pauly and Tsuka- yarna 1987) can perhaps serve as a model in this direction, both in the attempt to readily available the basic data for use by anyone with an innovative idea. If the concept were to be emulated in other regional systems, the comparative method of science (Mayr 1982) might constitute a potent tool for increasing the power of empirical analysis (Bakun 1985).

Introduction The 1842) (Pisces: Clupmidea: Engraulidae) is distributed west coast of South America between 4\"s (northern Peru) and 42.5\"s (southern central Chile) in the waters of the Humboldt Current. Being abundant in large schools, the anchoveta was heavily exploited by the world's largest The fishery continues a reduced level. The catch is mainly used for the production of fish meal and oils. The biology of the anchoveta has been investigated since the 1950s. Research on this species has been extended and intensified in the 1970s in order to understand its dependency on the South American upwelling ecosystem and its interaction with its other members, and to develop management plans for the Chilean and especially for the Peruvian anchoveta fisheries. A considerable number of papers has been written during this time, either published in the primary literature, forming a part of the \"grey\" (report) literature or being circulated as manuscripts. This preliminary bibliography is an attempt to summarize the available information on the biology of Unpublished manuscripts and internal reports Synonyms of Engraulis ringens were included based on Whitehead et al. (1988). The literature search was performed in two steps, of which the first one used the following January Services (BIOSIS) Previews (from January 1969 to January 1989); (iii) a list of publications available from IMARPE, Centro de Infonnacidn y Documentaci6n en Ciencias Acuhticas y Pesqueras, Esq. Garnarra y Gra. Valle sln, Apartado 22, Callao, Perti; (iv) a bibliographic compilation on \"El Niiio\" (Marigtegui et al. 1985); (v) a list of PROCOPA publications (Appendix II, this vol.) (vi) holdings of the ICLARM library, and (vii) collections of ICLARM staff, especially that of this book's senior editor. In the second step, the available publications were accessed individually the bibliographic part. Numbers in brackets indicate incomplete information, e.g., with respect to page numbers. An asterisk (*) following the number indicates that the reference is part of the ICLARM library collection andfor private collections of ICLARM staff. We emphasize that the present version of this bibliography is incomplete. For example, there is limited access to the literature from Chile and the Soviet Union. As presented here, the bibliography forms the core of a computerized version, which is available as Microsoft Word or ASCII file from ICLARM at a nominal fee (see Appendix 11, this vol.). This computerized version will be updated as new reprints become popular Dr. Daniel Pauly, ICLARM, for giving us access to his extensive collection of materials on the Peruvian anchoveta.

Abstract An analysis of 43 maps of hake larvae (Merluccius gayi) distribution off the Peruvian coast, from survey areas between 3'30' and 18's for 1966 to 1987, was performed and an index of larval abundance was calculated. on hake eggs and larvae and on the distribution area hake larvae. The latter increased two- to fourfold in the period of low anchoveta biomass from 1972 to 1983. The hake larvae both larvae and adult are discussed with reference biotic factors.

Introduction The interactions in the 1970s between the major pelagic fish of the Peruvian Contribution No. 94. species, hake (Merluccius other hand, resulted in a great abundance and area extension by the sardine and apparently also by horse mackerel and hake. This requires that we include the early life history stages of these species in our investigations of the dynamics of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem, and that we should look for relationships between the abundance of eggsParvae and adult biomasses. Until some years ago, have been discussions on interspecific ecosystem. Normally, the 10\"s. However, following \"El Nifio\" extended to (Velez 1983). Previous studies on the reproduction of hake off Peru and Chile include Fischer (1959), Miranda (1966), Saetersdal and Villegas (1968), Fischer and Balbontin (1970), Balbontin and Fischer (1981), and Alheit (1986). Fig. depicts hake larvae of pelagic fish species, mainly anchoveta, on the early stages of hake, e.g., through predation of adult anchoveta on hake eggs (and larvae?) and interlarval (anchoveta/hake) competition. The analysis of data from 43 surveys, conducted off Peru from 1966 to 1987 provided information on hake larval abundances and on the latitudinal distribution of spawning Although these surveys were not specially hake 1.

H lmm Materials and Methods The data used stem from 43 surveys conducted from 1966 to 1987 (Table I), the same as used by Santander (1987) to discuss anchoveta egg distributions. Sampling was performed as described for anchoveta eggs by Santander and Sandoval de Castillo (1969) and Santander (1987), who also described the sampling gear. The surveys ranged from 10 nautical miles (n.m) to 220 n.m. offshore and from 3'30's to the Chilean border. Table 1. Key statistics of the ichthyoplankton surveys considered in this contribution?

Results and Discussion Hake spawn during the whole year (Fig. 2), but a major peak usually occurs in Augusfleptember (Fig. 3). In general, about 5 to 15% (in 1972 up to 25%) of the females are ready to spawn in any given month. Table 1 suggests the highest extension area generally occurs during the austral winter (July-September) (Santander and Sandoval de Castillo 198 1). For interyear comparisons, we used only weighed by the latitudinal distribution area! were plotted against anchoveta biomass. As might be seen Fig. 4, low weighed hake larvae abundances (AL) occur when anchoveta are very abundant.

Fig. 3. Prornedio mensual del &dice gonadosoinhtico de la merluza peruana en el pertodo 1971 -1980. Anchoveta biomass ( t x 10' ) This inverse relationship is mainly due to an extension of the distribution area of hake larvae. Before 1972 and after 1983, hake larvae normally did not extend to more than 8-9's (i.e., an extension of 3 degrees). From 1972 to 1983 and in several years thereafter, hake larvae extended their distribution, in 6-12 degrees), i.e., two- to fourfold (see also Santander and Sandoval de Castillo 198 1). The relation between hake larvae and hake biomass Wosnitza- Mendo and Espino latter including were cohort analysis, and we can exclude statistical artifacts as the cause for the Table 2.

Hake blornass (t x lo3) was computed, resulted in: whose slopes have the expected =0.787 and d.f.=12, is significant (P<0.01). The slope associated with anchoveta biomass (i.e., -0.0681) has, however, a very high standard error (0.406) suggesting that anchoveta may have no effect on the abundance of hake larvae once the (negative) correlation between anchoveta and hake biomass is accounted for. The aim of the present study was to analyze: a) the influence of anchoveta biomass on larval hake increment of the larval distribution area of hake from 1972 to 1983. Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (1988) discuss the size of adult hake distribution conditions oxygen content of deeper water layers), which increase in austral summer and autumn and decrease in austral winter and spring. During \"El Niiio\" events, the distribution area of hake increases anomaly (see also Muck, this vol.). On the other hand, hake larvae usually cover a greater area in austral winter than in summer and maintained a two- to fourfold area extension over a 12-year period (1972-1983). This is probably not caused by the range extension of adult hake; rather, it can be attributed to the drastic reduction of anchoveta biomasses which occurred in 1972, as was suggested by Santander and Sandoval de Castillo (1981). This suggests that, for hake, winter spawning allow hake to over a greater area reduced predation. Figs. 6 to 15 illustrate this range extension over the period from 1966 to 1987. Fig. 6.

Introduction (Guichenot), family Merluccidae, is the main hake species off the western coast of South America, where it occurs in two forms: M. gayi peruanus off Peru and M. gayi gayi off Chile (Ginsburg 1954). Off Peru, M. gayi is most abundant in the north where it has been commercially exploited since the mid-1960s. Earlier contributions and dynamics of Merluccius gayi Solar (1965), Vestnes et al. (1965a, 1965b, 1966), Stroem et al. (1966), Saetersdal and Villegas (1968), and Jones (1974). PROCOPA Contribution No. 87. 297 Studies on hake have been one area of emphasis of the Instituto del Mar del Peru (IMARPE) and of the Peruvian-German Cooperative Program of Fisheries Investigation (PROCOPA), leading to a number of publications which have largely clarified the status of this resource off Peru (see Armstrong 1981; Dioses 1984; Espino et al. 1984, 1984a, and the range of hake distribution off the Peruvian coast (Espino and Urquizo 1986). This relationship, along with an associated density-dependent mechanism the reconstruct the biomasses of hake off the Peruvian coast, from 1953 to 1987, based on cohort analysis (Pope 1972) and field data collected mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s (see Table 1 \\ Table 1. Basic information on Peruvian hake fishery, and on data used to m cohort analyses also text). Tabla 1. Inforrnacidn lxisica sobre la pesqueria' de rnerluza peruana y de lar ahtos usados en el andisis de cohortes (ver iambien texto). Year REMARKS 1987 Survev data used for initiating analysis Low catches due to catches, stock fully exploited, central data to or limited effect of trawler fleet, begins in 1965 with converted purse-seiners; age-length key taken from 1987 cruise and a mean length distribution for the 1964-1970 period, three options of Ft investigated: 0.0001; 0.00025 and 0.0005 yearl (see Fig. 1). aYears for which Fig. 1). survey data were available for comparison with results cohort analysis Since the 1980s the investigation of Peruvian hake have been oriented mainly to the implementation and application of direct evaluation such as swept-area and analytical models such as cohort analysis (Pope 1972). A description of the population dynamics of Peruvian hake in the years from 1971 to 1982 is presented in Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (1986). Due to near zero catches after 1982 brought about by an El Niiio and the termination of international fishing agreements, a cohort analysis up to 1986 was not possible without taking the risk of introducing a great error by selecting an erroneous value of terminal fishing mortality (Ft) (we recall here that use of cohort analysis is only recommendable if a considerable portion of the stock is taken by the fishery (Jones 1982)). However, by integrating information from demersal research cruises on stock numbers per age group in the cohort analysis, the 1983 to 1987 segment of the biomass estimates could be determined and used for calibration (Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo 1988, Espino et al. 1988). An analysis of hake stomach contents for the period of 1976 to 1986, in relation to its possible role as predator on anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) showed that, in case of coincidence of distribution area of the two species, hake could consume a considerable amount of anchoveta (Muck et al. 1988; Muck et al., this vol.). To complete the study over the 30-year period considered in the book \"The Peruvian Anchoveta and Upwelling Ecosystem: Three Decades (Pauly here to reconstruct hake numbers and biomasses from 1953 to 1987. Materials and Methods To reconstruct population numbers, the catch data presented in Table 2 were used. Between were available for the years from 197 1 to 1986. For the period from 1953 to 1970, the mean length-frequency distribution for the years between 1964 and 1970 was applied. The age-length key taken as representative of the years Table 2. Annual catch of Peruvian hake and estimates of all weights are in tomes. Tabla 2.

(1987), but the otoliths used for age determination stem from the earlier period, The reason for this approach was that wQ; assumed similar stock conditions for the two periods, because both the 1953-1970 the structure of the population was probably similar. The stock (in numbers) was calculated by means of a modified as M = 0.3 year-1 (Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo 1986), was made variable depending on SST through the equation where To is the mean SST in Puerto Chicama. This states that there is an inverse relationship between intensity of cannibalism and water temperature, also related to the changks in the size of distribution area (Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo 1988). The cohort analysis run was initiated with a terminal population size by the swept- area method (Espino et al. 1988). Thus, we avoided having to choose a terminal F which would have been very low in relation to M. The population estimates obtained for population sizes estimated through the surveys. The 1971 to 1982 results from a former analysis (Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo the population estimates obtained from the cohort analysis. In the processing of information from 1970 backwards, three different terminal F's were used for age group 10: 0.0001,0.00025 and 0.0005 year1, since we know that the catches were very small but do not know their exact vdue (see Table 1). For the comparison of the hake stock with the anchoveta population, the anchoveta biomasses were taken from Pauly et al. (1987). The relation between Peruvian hake biomass (BM) and anchoveta biomass (BA) was then expressed by the power function where a and b Variation (in weight and numbers, respectively) of Peruvian hake over the period considered here. Fig. 1 shows the three types of curves resulting from the three Ft values used for the 1970 to 1953 run. The values obtained for Ft = 0.0001 year-1 are well above those obtained for the other Ft values and do not seem realistic. In general, we would expect a more stable stock situation in the years before 1970 due to reasons presented further below. We are inclined to accept that hake biomass in the years from 1960 to 1970 varied between 2 x 105 and 3 x 105 tonnes. The years before 1960, due to the convergence of cohort estimates, do not show any differences related to the different Ft values. We can divide the time series into three periods: the first with very low to low exploitation rates; the second, with population under full exploitation; and the third, with reoccurrence of low exploitation rates. In the first period, from 19$3 to 1972, the population does not show great fluctuations and stays at a low level, while the anchoveta biomass is at its maximum level (see Pauly et al. 1987). During this period, the high biomasses of the anchoveta might have stabilized the hake population. In its early life and up to 1 year, hake is pelagic and feeds 1986). Thus, young hakes compete for food with the anchoveta, which in the northern area (i.e., in the main distribution area of hake) also feed hake in the early phase of the latter's life, is 090'91 (exploited stock only) ' Year hake Merluccius gayi, for the period 1970-1980. Note closeness of survey estimates (1981 and 1985) and see Table 1 and text for details. Fig. I.

Clearly, recxitment levels were lower years before 1970,which could be explained by competition with anchoveta. In the second period, from 1973 to 1981, the stock was fully exploited. International agreements permitted the operation of foreign high sea Thus, we have to include the influence of fishing pressure in our considerations. We note an increase of hake biomass in this period until later on. The biomass increase might have to three groups of all acting simultaneously: a) Hake become cannibals at about 50 cm, i.e., at about 5 years of age (Espino and Mendieta 1978). Initially, the fishing pressure was mainly acting on and the \"El Nifio\" 1972/73 to a on the of hake (the same occurred after the 1982183 event). The reason for this was the increase of the potential distribution area due to higher O2 levels near the sea bottom. c) Finally, perhaps a major factor might be, from 1972 on, the marked reduction of anchoveta biomass which stayed at a low level, and which led to a reduced consumption of hake eggs and larvae hakes. The reduction of hake biomass from 1979 to 1981 is attributed to overfishing (Espino et al. 1986). 200 - 180 - 160 - 140 - 120 - loo - 80 - 60 - 40 - Fig. 2.

In 1982, the biomass had declined to about 1.5 x 105 t, but recovered rapidly, to over 7 x 105 t (=I5 t km-2), a level never observed before. All of this occurred, however, in the absence of anchoveta. The preceding El Niiio events of 1953,1957158, 1965 and 1969 did not have as strong a positive impact as the 1972/73 and 1982183 events. The comparison of the cohort analysis with the cruise data from 1981 and 1985 (Fig.\" 1) shows the same tendencies and a remarkably good fit, taking into account that the swept-area method only estimates the exploited part of the stock underestimates the stock of younger fishes. Former cruise estimates, for the years before 1980, are highly inflated, due to the fact that the area covered by densest hake concentrations was only a small part of the total distribution area, and that most trawl hauls were made only on these densest concentrations. Furthermore, in some cruises, a catch efficiency factor of 0.25 only was used for the net . The relationship between anchoveta and correlation coefficient r = 0.76. Fig. 3 shows the original data points and the derived curve. These suggest a stock-controlling influence of anchoveta possibly via egg predation, as described in Muck et al. (1987) for sardine/anchoveta. The interactions between hake and anchoveta, however, are not unidirectional. During its early life, hake competes with anchoveta for food and might also suffer from the predation of especially southernly than the adults (see Sandoval et al., this vol.). On the other hand, adult hake feeds on anchoveta, but mainly in the north, where adult hakes are abundant. In any case, the impact of anchoveta on hake is probably greater de 10s stocks de peces demersales y el ambiente marino en Enero-Febrem 1987. IMARPE, Informe Interno. 15 p. Armstrong, D. 1981.

'Abstract A model north-south of hake (Merlucciw water layers. This model is used, along with available information on biomass of anchoveta and hake, and on the diet of hake to estimate the overlap between the stock of anchoveta (Engroulis ringem) and that of hake, and the likely anchoveta consumption of hake from 1953 to the mid-1980s. Resumen Se presenta un modelo el cud describe la distxibuci6n norte-sur de la merluza (Merluccius goyi) a lo largo de la costa en relacih a 10s cambios de la temperatura superficial del mar, indicadores tambih de cambia en el contenido de oxfgeno en las capas profundas de aguas. Este modelo es usado con la informacih disponible sobre biomasa de anchweta y merluza, y sobre la dieta de merluza para estimar el traslape entre el stock de anchoveta (Engmulis ringem) y el de merluza y el consumo de anchoveta por merfuza desde 1953 a mediados de la ddcada del80. Introduction Mortality due to predation or of the most important processes affecting anchoveta population dynamics off Peru. As sea birds (Muck and Pauly 1987), pinnipeds (Muck 1987b; Muck and total consumption of anchoveta by various predators is (i) of the same order of magnitude as the fishery catches, and (ii) varies with the physical characteristics of the upwelling system off Peru. With the present contribution on anchoveta consumption by semi-pelagic Peruvian hake, the \"cycle\" of major anchoveta predators is completed. The Distribution Model The size of hake distribution area is dependent of the oxygen condition in the deeper water layers (100-200 m), seasonal and inter-annual 1986; Espino 1988). Contribution No. 89. While the offshore distribution of hake is more or less constant and largely limited to the east-west extension of the continental shelf, the north-south distribution apparently the content deeper water layers, which is increased when warm, oxygen-rich waters intrude, from the north, into the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem (e.g., during El Niiio events). The dynamics of the oxygen minimum zone can be expressed as a sea surface temperature (SST), which allows the estimation of the total area of hake distribution, as described in Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (1988). Modifying equation (1) given by these authors, by as a mean offshore extension a constant \"C\" (=70 km), the alongshore extension of hake distribution (Ext., in km) can be approximated by: Ext. = lo5 C * ((1 + e-0.2852 * (SST-18.16)) During cold years, hake is most abundant in the north of Peru, within 2-70S, with a density maximum at 5%. This distribution pattern can be approximated by a normal distribution curve with mean (X) = 5 and standard deviation (s.d.) = 1.25 (Fig. I), or Y = 1 * e-0.5 * (Lat. - X1s.d.) 2 s.d. * -0- Model pred~ct~ons \\ \\ \\ \\ I \\ Fig. 1. Observed (in 1981, 1984 and 1985) and estimated relative density of hake biomass along the Peruvian mast. Fig. I. Densidad relativa estimada y observada (en 1981, 1984, 1985) de la biornaro de la rnerluza a lo largo de la costa peruana. Latitude (OS) Thus, if we assume that the northern limit of hake distribution is more or less constant (i.e., 2OS, see Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo 1988), and that the southern extension of hake distribution in 1982183 was the maximum ever, since it occurred during the very strongest El Niiio on record (during which SST = 26.6OC in autumn 1983, for 4-14OS), the north-south extension estimated through equation (1) would be 1,3 10 km, implying a southern limit of hake distribution near 14's (Fig. 2). Thus, the density maximum (Dmax, in OS, i.e., W in equation 2) of the latitudinal distribution of hake can be expressed as an SST-related variable: Dm, = -0.227 + SST ( Winter 1975) r = 19.50~ rnrner 1972) Fig. 2 Total biomass of Peruvian hake to occur off 1-14OS, from three different SST regimes. Latitude (OS) and equation (2) may be rewritten as Fig. 2. Biomasa total & la merluza peruana frente a 1-14OS estirnada & 3 diferentes regimenes & TSM. Fig. 2 shows model results (equations 3 and 4) for hake density distribution SST-regimes: SST $ST = 1983) percentage of total (POP%) which is distributed, given SST, south of a given latitude, corresponds to the area under the normal distribution. This is defined, in the standardized normal distribution, by the variable z. In this case: The corresponding area (= POP%) for different values of Z are tabulated in most statistic texts and can also be calculated using and the and negative of Z, the output of equation (7) is subtracted from 100.) Table 1 gives the (Dm=) corresponding the of population for different values of total (e.g., SST = 230C) Dm= 6.90S, i.e., about 26% of the total hake population is distributed south of 80s and the subpopulation within, e.g.,8-90s is about 15% of the total hake population (Table 2). The data given in Table 2, with the VPA biomass Espino of the hake biomass within each degree of latitude along the coast of Peru in relation to SST. The Feeding Model The total daily food intake of a population (Rtot.) can be expressed as the sum of the intake by each age (or weight) group (Rt): where Nt is the number of individuals of age t and Rt the mean daily ration of an individual of age t. The daily anchoveta consumption (Ra) can be expressed as a fraction of by: where A <I) availability to the predator. This availability can be viewed as a function of the biomass the vulnerability predator size and varies between different areas off the Peruvian coast (Muck et al. 1988; Fuentes et al., in press). Fig. 3 shows annual means of the fraction of anchoveta (P%-anch.) in the stomach contents of adult hake population south of a latitude along the Peruvian coast, as related to SST. Tabla 1.

LI 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 Years While in the Paita area (4-60s) in 1976-1981, anchoveta represented only ca. 10% of value was much higher (i.e.,over go%), period, Chimbote (8- 100s). The values of P%-anch., for hake of 35 to 45 cm caught off Paita were significantly (r = 0.79, d.f. 9; P < 0.05) positively correlated with mean annual anchoveta biomass or Ba (see also Muck, this vol., i.e.) or, when excluding the years with less reliable anchoveta biomass estimates (i.e., 1980 to 1983) (r = 0.86, d.f. = 5; P < 0.05.) Thus, increasing anchoveta total abundance within 4-140s results, in the area, in an increasing anchoveta component in hake stomachs. (The same can be during the the intercept of equation (13) by forcing the line through the origin leads to P%-anch. (Paita) = 4.98 * Ba ... 14) Thus, the total anchoveta biomass estimated for the area 4-14OS (Pauly et al. 1987a) must be close to or beyond 20 t x 106 for the anchoveta fraction to reach 100% in the stomachs of hake of 35-45 cm, in the area of Paita. On the other hand, in the area of Chimbote, P%-anch. values close to 100 have been found, , for hake of 35-45 cm, during 1976,1978,1979 and 198 1, when mean total anchoveta biomass was only of about 3.2 t x 106. This can be expressed as: P%-anch. (Chimbote) = 30.9 * Ba Interpolating between Paita (50s) and Chimbote (9%) equations (4) and (15) can now be combined to: P%-anch. = (-27.42 + 6.48 * Lat.) * Ba ... 16) which quantifies the anchoveta fraction in the stomachs of hake ranging from 35-45 cm as a function of (i) anchoveta biomass and (ii) latitude south. Multiplying equation (16) by 0.01, we obtain the anchoveta availability index (A) of equation (1 1): A = ((-27.42 + 6.48 * Lat.) * BJ * 0.01 ... 17) (In all computations, when equation (17) produced estimates of A larger then unity, A was set equal to 1.) Fig. 4 shows the dynamics of anchoveta availability to hake for different values of anchoveta total biomass, and suggests that the north-east gradient between Paita and Ghimbote is eliminated when anchoveta total biomass is higher than about 10 x 106 tonnes. To for size groups of hake other than 35-45 cm, the data of Table 3 have been used (see also Fig. 5). The increase of anchoveta in the diet of hake between 22 and 42 cm reflects the shift of these fish from a pure zooplankton diet to a fish diet, while the decreasing trend of anchoveta in the diet of hake > 42 cm is related to their transition from a diet of small fishes (i.e., anchoveta) to larger ones (sardine, in item figure suggests that hake below 20 cm and above 70 cm do not feed on anchoveta. Fig. 7 shows the size-frequency distribution of anchoveta in the stomachs of hake of 20-70 cm. The VPA-estimates of hake biomass in Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (this vol.) refer to age group while the stomach content analyses data refer to size groups (of 5 cm width). To convert size to age, the inverse of the von Bertalanffy formula was used: The constants for hake are (Dioses 1985): K = 0.139 year-1 Loo = 99cm to = year of the lengthlage Table 3 with values put on an age basis. The frequency the latter can be approximated by: where \"t\" refers to hake age groups 1-7, i.e., to those age groups which feed on anchoveta. Thus, we can generalize equation (17) to: 2 t * 0.5- 1.5 A = ((-27.42 + 6.48 * Lat.) * BA) * e [ . ] *a01 ... 20) which allows the estimation of anchoveta availability for each age group of hake as a function of anchoveta biomass and latitude south. The total daily ration of an individual of the age group t (Rt) can be estimated using the mean total stomach weight per (1983): (s.d.)

For age group abundance, the VPA-estimates of Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (this vol.) has been used. These authors found an relationship between anchoveta and suggest that anchoveta controls hake population growth at the level of egg and larvae predation. This hypothesis is supported by time series analysis of hake larvae abundance (Sandoval et al., this vol.), and agrees with the findings of Muck et al. (1988) for sardine in that anchoveta controls population growth of other fish species by feeding on their eggs and larvae. Hake distribution been as a of SST, which reflects the seasonal and El Niiio-related size of the oxygen minimum zone depths 100-200 m (Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo are consumption within 3-7OS, moves southward. The data of Fuentes et al. (in press) for Callao (12OS.L.) and Pisco (13S0S.L.) show that when such conditions prevail, feed predominantly function of anchoveta biomass and hake size. The model includes an anchoveta distribution component which results in an increasing availability of anchoveta to hake, in the area 4-7's (= northern boundary of anchoveta distribution) with increasing of distribution whose parameters (mean, standard deviation) were empirically derived from survey data. The model results in a latitudinal shift of the density maximum of hake distribution as a function of SST, accompanied by or prerecruit survival, as suggested in Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (this vol.).

Similar to mackerel species, resulting in a variable predation stress on anchoveta, which is higher in summer than during winter and very high during El Niiio events.

Abstract The horse mackerel fishery of the South Pacific currently dominates the world's catch of horse mackerels. The rapid increases in catches of horse mackerel by South American purse seine fleets and the distant water USSR trawl fleet discussed and the of the species which supports the fishery, a review of the world's Trachurus was made. The results of this review show that neither of the eastern Pacific forms of Trachwus merits full species rank. It is concluded that both are subspecies of the oceanic horse mackerel southeastem Pacific. It is further suggested that it is the extends clear across the southern hemisphere west wind drift region (i.e., from the South Atlantic to Chile).

Introduction Horse mackerels, of the genus Trachurus, are a widespread group occurring nearly all the temperate and subtropical, neritic regions of the oceans and tropical neritic regions. The taxonomy of the group is in considerable flux and their extensive distribution is undoubtedly, at least partially, the cause of the present taxonomic confusion: forms which are very similar but widely separated geographically, are assumed, a priori, to be separate species by many workers. Over the last two decades the horse mackerels have had one of the largest increases in the world's fish catch. Landings rose from 1.2 x 106 tonnes (t) in 1965 to 3.9 x 106 t in 1984. In 1965 catches of horse mackerel were principally from 1A). Although horse mackerel occur in much of the world ocean, the bulk of its catches, and supposedly biomass, over the last two decades (Table 1). In 1965 half of the world catch of Trachurus came from the northwestern Pacific (0.55 x 106 t) and the rest was primarily taken in the northeastern Atlantic (0.22 x 106 t) and southeastern Atlantic (0.31 x 106 t). By the early 1970s catches from the northwestern Pacific had declined greatly, Catches reached a maximum of 0.91 x 106 t in the northeastern Atlantic in 1973 and a maximum of 0.97 x 106 t in the southeastern Atlantic in 1978. Most of these increases in catches were due to the development of distant-water trawl fisheries off North and South Africa by European nations. Development of the South Pacific Fishery The most significant change in the world's horse mackerel catches occurred as the result of the development of the southeastern Pacific fishery which rose from 0.015 x 106 t in 1965 to a maximum of 2.32 x 106 t in 1984 (Fig. 1C). The South Pacific fishery was developed in the early 1970s by Chilean purse seiners forced to alter their fishing collapse of the ''O 1 Northern 1 .5 hemis~here Southern hemisphere Eastern A ,4, boundary ! \\-,, ; t, currepts ; v Total z 2.5 5 3 2.0 ? 1.5- L \"- 1.0 1.0 - Fig. 1.

Chilean landings of horse mackerel reached 0.5 x 106 t in 1978 and, except for the El Niiio year of 1983, have exceeded 1.4 x 106 t since 1981. In the early 1970s Peru also began to the production of the Chilean fishery and with the exception of 1977- 1978, when landings were near 0.5 x 106 t, landings have averaged less than 0.1 x 106 t. Both Chilean mackerel fisheries are almost exclusively economic zones. The Chilean fishery started in northern Chile, in the Ariea-Antofagasta region and expanded to central Chile in the late 1970s (Serra 1987). During the 1980s the Chilean landings have been about equally divided between the Arica-Antofagasta region (18-24's) and the Talcahuano region (37's); landings in the Coquimbo region of central Chile (30\"s) have been an order of magnitude less than in the other two regions (Serra 1987). Fishing areas for the Peruvian catches are not well-documented in the available literature. Table 2. Southeastern Pacific Trachurus catch by country (FA0 Area 87; x lo2 t). Tabla 2. Captura de Trachums en elPac@o Surorientnl por paires (Area 87 de FAO; x 102 t). Chile Peru Ecuador USSR Other - Total In 1978, trawlers from the USSR began fishing for horse mackerel offshore of the 200 mile limits of Peru and Chile and during the period 1979-1985 they have annually taken between 0.49 and 0.59 x 106 t in the offshore area (Table 1). The development and distribution of this distant water trawl fishery is well documented in the positions of the trawlers as reported in international meteorological observations. At the beginning of the fishery (1979) the reported positions were spread out in a band along the coast, outside of the 200 mile zones (i.e., between 80\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W from 10\u00b0S to 45's in Fig. 1983 reports show the fishery was con- centrated off southern Chile at about 80\u00b0W and 40\u00b0S (Fig. 2B); however, there were also a considerable number of reports along 85OW north of the area of concentration. There was an absence of reports within Chile's 200 mile zone; Chile also has 200 mile zones around San Felix Island and Juan Fernandez Archipelago. By 1985, in addition to a distribution of reports similar to 1983, the reports show that the fishery extended westward along the west wind drift between 39 and 45's (Fig. 2C). To evaluate of the Soviet fishery, the meterological reports were limited to Soviet vessels and to 1984-1987, the period when the fishery was operating in the offshore west wind drift region. the austral spring (October-December) the meterological reports furthest the (Fig. 3A). Reports are noticeably absent in the 200 mile zones around San Felix Island (26OS, 80\u00b0W) and the Juan Fernandez Archipelago (33OS, 80\u00b0W) but there are reports in international waters between the two zones and between the San Felix Island 200 mile zone and the continental 200 mile zone. During the austral autumn (April-June) the reports are concentrated in two regions 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 Long itude (OW) Fig. 2.

The fust is about five degrees south of the spring concentration (i.e., between 39-45's and 79-90\u00b0W) and the second is much further offshore (39-45's and 100-120\u00b0W). In both spring and autumn there are also considerable numbers of reports in the offshore region extending toward New Zealand. The South Pacific distribution of the meterological reports from the Soviet trawl fleet suggests that, in the offshore region, horse mackerel are concentrated along the South Pacific subtropical convergence and that they seasonally move north and south with the convergence. It appears that the horse mackerel are able to complete their entire life cycle in the South Pacific subtropical convergence; independent of the neritic zone. Evseenko (1987) reported several larvae and a juvenile in the South Pacific convergence and Bailey (1989) shows that the horse mackerel spawns across the South Pacific from New Zealand to Chile.

The FA0 catch statistics consider the horse mackerel in this region to be Trachurus murphyi, but there is little agreement in the literature as to the correct species name. For example, in Peru the commonly used name is T. symmetricus murphyi, whereas in Chile the name T. murphyi is used (Santander and Flores 1983; Serra 1983). Therefore a review of the literature on the taxonomy of the horse mackerels was carried out to ascertain the status of the Pacific South American form. The world's trachurids have been reviewed by Nichols (1920, 1940), Berry and Cohen (1974) and Shaboneyev (1980). Since Nichols (1920) the literature has contained 17 species and 2 subspecies (Table 3). The number and relative size of the scutes along the lateral line and the relative length of the dorsal accessory lateral line has been primary importance in separating the various heavily based on these characteristics. The taxonomy of the group is still in flux and it is not known if the forms in many regions are separate at the species, subspecies or even lower levels. The problem was perhaps best stated by from different oceans that authors synonymize them, but in no case where I have had material for comparison do they seem to me to be quite identical. They might all be races of a that two the recognized 12 but he concluded by all of the species described to that time would have been races of T. trachurus, T. picturatus and T. mediterraneus (Table descriptions of Trachurur used in recent literature.

Species 1920 = Nichols Aleev 1956 T.picturatus Razumovskaya Cohen (1974) synonymized two of the species recognized by Nichols (1940), accepted two new species new species; recognizing 13 species. They did not group the species as did Nichols but described the relationships between similar forms in different regions. These descriptions result in groups of similar species which are very much like those of Nichols (Table 4). They also showed that there is only one species in the entire western Atlantic (T. lathami) and this has recently been verified by Saccardo 4. Groupings of similar species various authors. Tabla 4.

Shaboneyev placed the 11 species into three groups of species and one aberrant form (Table 4). The grouping of similar forms by Nichols (1940), Berry and Cohen (1974) and Shaboneyev (1980) are nearly identical and result in Trachurus form (the trachurus type), a tropical form (the mediterraneus type) and an oceanic form (the picturatus type). The geographical distributions of Shaboneyev's trachurus group (Fig. 4A) and mediterraneus group (Fig. 4B) demonstrate the separation into a more temperate group (trachurus) and a more tropical group (mediterraneus). The number of scutes is considerably greater in the oceanic form than the other forms (Table 4) and all three reviews are in agreement in the species included in this group; however, there are minor differences in the inclusion of japonicus and novaezelandia within the other two groups. These are the two forms which Nichols (1940) was unsure of, stating that muccullochi (now novaezelandia) should perhaps trachurus group and that japonicus should perhaps be included in the mediterraneus group. Berry and Cohen (1974) stated that muccullochi may be a southern hemisphere cognate of japonicus and that japonicus was the most morphologically similar to lathami and they placed both muccullochi and relative size of their scutes. his trachurus group the depth of the largest scute in the posterior part of the lateral line averages from 12.2 to 16.6% of the head length; whereas group in Longitude (M), Iathami horse mackerel: picturatus (P), symmetricus (S), murphyi (M), aleevi (A) and unnamed (U). Fig. 4. Dirtribucidn de A. mediterraneus (P), symmetricus (S), murphyi (M), aleevi (A) y sin nombre (U). Stephenson and Robertson (1977) showed that T. muccullochi was a junior synonym of T. novaezelandia and they found no grounds for distinction between T. novaezelandia and T. japonicus. They did not formally synonymize these forms apparently due to the fact that there is no gene flow across the present day Indo-Pacific gap in their distributions and they felt this necessitated retaining both species. Stephenson and Robertson (1977) also point out the close similarities between japonicus, novaezelandia and lathami. There is a general consensus that the members of the picturatus or oceanic group are very closely related. Shaboneyev (1980) even states that the members of this group are morphologically so similar that it is difficult to identify them. This consensus rapidly disappears distinct species or whether they lower (Jordan and Everman 1896; Meek and Hildebrand 1925) a single species (T. picturatus). Nichols (1940) tried to have it both ways by listing them as separate species but murphyi picturatus. Roedel Fitch (1952) found minor differences of distinguish symmetricus from picturatus. Berry and Cohen (1974) gave all three the status of species but considered murphyi to be an ecotype of contrast, Kotlyar's extensive Peruvian horse concluded that was not sufficiently different from sy~nmetricus to merit species rank and he considered it to a (T.s. murphyi). According to Shaboneyev and Kotlyar (1979), Aleyev (1957) considered the eastern Pacific forms to be a subspecies of picturatus and he also considered the northern and southern Atlantic forms of picturatus to be separate subspecies. In their morphological analysis of the eastern Pacific forms of Trachurus (i.e., symmetricus and murphyi) and considerably greater of material, show overlap in all the characters investigated between the oceanic horse mackerel and the eastern Pacific forms of the genus Trachurus\". they found they felt reached the subspecies level and differences in the length of the dorsal branch of the lateral line which reached the subspecies level. Although they admitted that they did not find sufficient species, they concluded by suggesting that the ecological differences between them was great enough to merit species rank for the Atlantic and Pacific forms. Their reasons for this conclusion were as follows: They considered that picturatus differed from the eastern Pacific in that it is a neritic-oceanic form widely distributed not only on the continental shelf but also far beyond its boundaries. This distribution demonstrated that picturatus may live in different water masses, for example, in the cold Canary Current, and in the subtropical waters south of the North Atlantic Current. \"The most striking contrast with the eastern Pacific forms is provided by the possibility of the existence of the oceanic horse mackerel in the epicontinental Mediterranean, in water masses group. Rytov and Razumovskaya described a new subspecies of picturatus (Tp. aleevi) from the southern Indian Ocean and Evseenko (1987) and Bailey (1989) have shown that murphyi occurs in the west wind drift region (along about 40\"s) from Chile to New Zealand. According to Rytov and Razumovskaya (1984), \"the present grouping of the ocean scads into separate species on the basis of geographic isolation is artificial\". They agreed with early authors who recognized only one species of oceanic horse mackerel (T. picturatus) which occurs in the eastern North and South Atlantic, the eastern North Pacific, the South Pacific and the southern Indian Ocean. The distribution of three of the picturatus group are presently described; 1983; and Bailey, in press). Unfortunately the southern Indian Ocean distribution of aleevi is not given by Rytov and Razumovskaya (1984), who give only the location of the holotype. The distribution of picturatus in the South Atlantic is also poorly documented in the literature and it is further confounded by the fact that T. picturatus bingami has synonymized with T. lathami (Berry and Cohen 1974; Saccardo 1987). The only verified record found for picturatus from the South Atlantic was the holotype of Decapterus longimanus, from Tristan de Cunha examined by Berry and Cohen (1974). The distribution of the T. picturatus group as described in the above works is obviously underrepresented in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Ocean (Fig. 4C). Its occurrence along the warm side of the west wind drift regions of the South Atlantic, South Indian and South Pacific suggests that picturatus may occur in a continuous band along the west wind drift region from the South Atlantic to Chile. As shown above, Shaboneyev and Kotylar's (1979) ecological distinction between the Atlantic and Pacific forms of the picturatus group is unwarranteci as forms should also be considered distributions than picturatus. They occur from the cold waters of the Gulf of Alaska and Southern Chile to the subtropical waters of Southern Baja California and the Galapagos Islands. They also extend offshore from Chile to New Zealand. It is true that they are not known to occur in waters as saline as the Mediterranean. However, since such waters do not occur in the Pacific Ocean, this does not prove that the eastern Pacific forms are not capable of geographical the oceanic horse mackerel are insufficent to warrant breaking the group Trachurus picturatus in the northeastern Pacific and T.p. murphyi in the southern ocean. The southern ocean form may be subdivided into three subspecies or races: murphyi in the Pacific, aleevi in the Indian and an unnamed form in the Atlantic. The recent large increase available in my opinion, definitive analysis of the between the Trachurus occurring in analysis. In the absence of such an analysis, the division of the genus into species is probably more a function one splitters and one for lumpers (Table 5). 1 also note that considerable further lumping within the trachurus and the mediterraneus groups may be in order, perhaps even to the three species suggested by Nichols (1940).

Resumen Las relaciones entre fluctuaciones ambientales y la dieta, la production total, modidad y pesos de crias de lobo fino de Sudamerica (Arctocephalus alcstralis) son examinadas. Los datos fueron colectados entre 1982 y 1988 y cubren dos eventos El Nio y tres aiios frios. La dieta de 10s lobos, estimada a pair del anfisis de heces, fue afectada por cambios en la dispibilidad de anchoveta (Engradis ringens). En aiios cuando la anchoveta estuvo escasa, la dieta de 10s lobos fue mas variada. Cuando la anchoveta fue abundante, casi no comieron otra cosa. La producci6n and de crias en la playa estudiada estuvo entre 1,381 y 2,171. La mortalidad de crias fue de 294%. Dentro de cada aiio, la mortalidad durante la temporada de reproduccih estuvo relacionada con la densidad de hembras adultas. Se hall6 una relaci6n significativa en& la temperatura superficial del mar y el peso de la crias. La disponibiiidad de presa, en especial de anchoveta, parece afectar el suceso reproductive y de aliientacih de 10s lobos rnarinos en P~N. Like other members of the Family Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions), fur seals breed on land and forage at sea. They land (Gentry et al. 1986). This reproductive strategy makes fur seals vulnerable to fluctuations in at sea. Mothers replenish their fat reserves regularly in order to raise their young and thus depend on a constant food supply to breed successfully. The South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis, Zimmerman 1783) is found in the most diverse range of habitats of any fur seal. It occurs all around southern South America, from sub-tropical Peru, around Cape Horn and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and up to southern Brazil, covering a latitudinal range of about 35' (Majluf and Trillmich 1981). However, little is known about the ecology of South American fur seals and what limited information is available comes mainly from studies of the population in (Vaz-Ferreira 1956, 1971, 1982; Ximenez et al. 1984; Ponce de Leon 1984). The Peruvian population is of particular *Present address: Dept. de Biologia, Universitad Caetano Heredia, Apto 5045, Lima 100, Ped. interest because it is the only one, along with that of the Galapagos fur seal (A. galapagoensis), which breeds on or close to the equator (Bonner 198 1). The presence of fur seals in Peru is linked to the flow of the cold Peruvian (Humboldt) current along the west coast of South America (Majluf and Trillmich 1981). This current dramatically affects the climate and productivity of coastal Peru and giving Cushing 1982; and see contributions in Pauly and 1987). This system sustains a large biomass of pelagic fish dominated by a single species, the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), which supports, 1973; breeding in Peru, however, fur seals face unpredictable fluctuations in food supply. At variable intervals of between 2 to 7 years, the upwelling system is affected by major oceanic perturbations abundance anchoveta, among other things. The effects of El Niiio events on the Peruvian seabird populations and fisheries have been well documented (Cushing Tovar 1987; 1987), but less is known about how fur seals in Peru are changes (Limberger et al. 1983; Majluf 1985; Trillmich et al. 1986). This study examines how the Peruvian population of the South American fur seal has adapted to its environment by looking at its ecology and behavior, particularly how pup production, mortality and weight. This could be done in the frame of a relatively short 6-year study because sea conditions varied widely during obtained during the severe 1982/1983 El Niiio events; but where relevant, data from these years were included to show how conditions of extreme food shortage affected fur seals. One must bear in mind, the 198211983 El Niiio event was exceptionally strong, and that, its effects are likely to be considerably greater than those of previous events. The study was carried out at Punta San Juan (PSJ, 1S022'S, 7S012'W, Fig. I), which holds up to 50% of the fur seals in Peru (Majluf and Trillmich 1981). PSJ is the area of coldest waters, most upwelling (Zuta et al. 1978) and highest primary productivity (Cushing 1982) off the coast of Peru. 1 Northern breedmg lirn~t\\ 1 155 Fig. 1.

Years mentioned in the text cover the breeding season when a given cohort was born and January, February and March of the subsequent year (e.g., 1985 includes data collected from October 1985 until March 1986). Survival data cover the period from birth to the following September. The 1982 data do not cover the breeding season; the 1983 data include January to August 1983 only. From 1984 on, each year after the breeding season Fur diet was studied from the analysis of hard parts (fish otoliths and squid beaks) found in fresh scats. Prey items were ranked by frequency of occurrence in the scats except for 1983 when the scats were not studied individually (they had been pooled before analysis). In 1983, the prey items were ranked by the proportion of the total Ms. Isabel Tsukayama (IMARPE). Only data from 1983, 1984 and 1985 are presented here (see Tsukayama and Palomares 1987, for time series of length data covering the years 1953 to 1982 and Pauly and Palomares, this vol. for an update to 1987). In JanuaryJFebruary 1983, pup mortality under El Niiio conditions was estimated from daily of dead pups on one beach at PSJ. Survival between February and March 1983 was estimated from resightings of pups tagged on another beach (n = 14), between 7-10 February, and resighted on the 7th March. From 1984 onwards (but excluding the of freshly dead pups and of placentas observed early in the morning. The number of pups born each day was estimated as twice the placenta count (see Majluf 1987 for rationale). All animals ashore on the study beach (divided by age and sex classes) were censused daily analyses were camed out using the SPSS-X statistical package on an IBM mainframe, and STATVIEW and STATWORKS on an Apple Macintosh include two El Niiio events (1982 and 1986), two cold years (1984 and 1987) and a \"normal\" year (1985, Fig. 2). These variations appear to be related to changes in distribution and abundance of pelagic fish and of the seals' behavior and reproductive performance. 2, \", Fig. 2.

Twenty species prey were identified but 86% of the otoliths belonged to of important prey items than 30 cm length/weight ranges and all known to leave the bottom after dark (Leible et al. 198 1, Chirichigno et al. 1982). Diet composition varied widely, (8112, item consumed (although urotramus made up to 40% of the otoliths collected, it was only found in three scats). The numbers and size ranges of otoliths of anchoveta varied between periods. The June and July 1983 samples only included one and four anchoveta otoliths respectively, and thus have not been included in the calculations presented below. When comparing the three years studied, the sizes of anchoveta taken by the seals were found to be significantly different in two of three cases (t-test: 1983 vs 1984: t = -10.7, df = 66, P < 0.001; 1984 vs 1985: t = 18.5, df = 103, P < 0.001; 1983 vs 1985: not significant). No differences in sizes were found within years. When the size distributions of anchoveta for each of these periods were compared with fishery catch data, the 1983 and 1985 samples closely matched the fishery catch composition for the same time periods while the 1984 sample was shifted to the left (Fig. 3). In 1983 and 1985, fur seals took mostly adult anchovetas (about 15 cm long), while they took smaller fish. Table consumidos por 10s lobos, ordenados segh In frecuencia de ocurrencia.

Anchoveta body length (TL, cm) The periods when adult anchovetas were missing from the fur seals' scats were related to periods when they were not available to the fisheries. Adult anchovetas did not occur in the scats during the winter in 1983 (June-August), nor during the spring and summer of 198411985 (October-January), when the seals took only very small anchoveta. Environmental conditions in these two periods were very different but in both cases, it is possible to relate them to a low availability of adult anchoveta. During the El Niiio event of 1982183, in June 1983, the few anchoveta that had been present in January-February were either dead or had migrated south (Arntz 1986; Vilchez et al. 1988). Also \"normal\" years, anchoveta become less available as they disperse when the warm water away from the coast (Zuta and Urquizo 1978; Muck the information available, it is not possible to separate the El Niiio effects from the normal winter dispersion. In 1984, no anchoveta were taken by the fisheries PSJ (Pedro Nifio event. in the diet (January-April 1983 and September- December 1985) can be related to a relatively high availability of anchoveta in the area.

There was in 1985 while pup production was highest in 1988. There were no correlations between the number of pups born and 46.5% of the pups (0-30 days old) died before the end of the breeding season. In general, mortality within the breeding period was less than 29%. Outside of the breeding season, mortality month. Most born during the breeding season, 15th of October within highest numbers of females ashore were observed. For all daily females ashore significantly correlated with the number of dead pups counted on the same day (Fig. 1982, during El Nifio. Of about 70 pups on one beach, at least 29 (41%, no! counting those washed out to sea) were seen dead on land between January and February. Afterwards, of 14 pups tagged in early February on another beach, only three (21%) were resighted by March. Only one of these three was resighted the following year. on one beach at PSJ between 1982 and 1988. Tabla 2.

This apparently is also the case for the fur seals at PSJ. Although information on changes in availability of anchoveta for the area around PSJ is limited, the data here suggest that there is a relationship between the fur seals' diet, as Also, apparently with preference for adult anchoveta. In eight of twelve sampling periods, anchoveta was the most important adult anchoveta were available at sea. In the periods when adult anchoveta were not the most frequently occurring item in the scats, a wider range taken and these with the periods of reported anchoveta scarcity. In contrast, when adult abundantly fisheries, of all otoliths recovered from the scats in from adult foraging theory among &her things, food is abundant than when it is scarce (MacArthur and Pianka 1966; 1978). An increase has been shown occur in the California sea (Bailey 1982). Thus, despite the dramatic decrease in biomass of anchoveta off the Peruvian coast since 1972 (Cushing 1982; Pauly et al. 1987), fur seals apparently still show a preference for anchoveta.

Also, during El Niiio in sufficient density, fur seals will obtain less the same number of fish because the condition of anchoveta is poor, resulting in a lower calorific content (Palomares et al. 1987). total number of between the four years studied. differences could be due to changes in female fertility or in the number of females using the study beach to give birth each year. There was no between the years studied. With the information available, it is not possible to show this, but changes in female fertility as a result of variations in the environment or in the condition of the females have been shown in breeding season was high and varying in all years in a similar pattern. All pups born before mid-October were either stillborn of the high pup mortality observed near the and were period after on approaching This aggression is exacerbated need to reach the water's edge for thermoregulation. This is so because avoid hypothermia while at sea adversely affect thermoregulation while they are on land. At high air temperatures, avoiding the sun and getting 1971; Limberger et al. 1986). At PSJ, there are only a few small caves and large boulders providing shade at the back of each beach. Therefore, the main means of thermoregulation for most animals is to wet their fur. Females who give birth in areas with no access to water are forced to make daily excursions to and from the water's edge. These probability of the water are attacked by other females while in transit. Often, dropped among other pups and confusion arises. It is very to observe females fighting over pups, or \"foreign\" pups being thrown about by females who do not want them near. Later in the season, aggression appears to decrease as most of the females go to sea to forage and only a smaller portion of the female population on during the breeding season been shown be cause mortality in other Antarctic elephant seals (Mirounga and Briggs 1977) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus, Anderson et al. 1979) suggest that the of mortality at the rhother, Le Boeuf and Briggs 1977). The results from this study also suggest that mortality the mother and pup. Mortality within the first month of life in all other species of fur seals does not exceed 20% Within PSJ, almost 60% of the fur seals breed on the study beach. The amount of space available for females and their pups on this beach is limited by the need to have access to water for thermoregulation. Thus, in the hot hours of the day, females are concentrated in about one third of the beach area (approximately 0.5- 1 female per m2). Though densities in other seal rookeries may be similar or even higher (Callorhinus at St. George, M. Goebel, pers. Bird Is., J.P.

Unfortunately, there is no for the 1983 breeding season, when pups died of conditions (survival data 1985, 1986 and 1987, i.e., during \"normal\", warm (poor) and mortality 1982 El Niiio was mainly due starvation caused by the of mothers foraging at sea (Majluf 1985; Trillmich et al. 1986). In the case of milder El Niiio events such as the one in 1986, pelagic fish tend to concentrate in areas where cold upwelled persist, particularly around PSJ (Villanueva et at PSJ might be able to forage close to shore and return to their pups often enough to avoid their starvation. in prey availability at sea. If the mothers are not able to hunt efficiently, they either take longer to obtain enough food to cover their own and their pups' metabolic demands, or they return ashore milk (Trillmich and Lirnberger Gentry et al. 1986). In either case, the pups' growth is slower and this is reflected in the recorded weights. In cases, growth is impaired but survival in the first year of life seems not to be affected. Conclusions The results of indicate a relationship between fluctuations in prey availability at the seals' and reproductive performance. PSJ is an exceptional area because cold waters tend to persist in this area even under El Niiio conditions. Thus, while even mild El Niiio events may have a negative effect on the seals further north along the Peruvian coast (Muck and Fuentes 1987), at PSJ, the seals may benefit from such conditions. If fish concentrated the If the is as intense as the one in 198211983, however, even at PSJ, fur seals will be negatively Like many other marine vertebrates in the system, fur seals have to feeding mainly on anchoveta, a species once abundant in this system. A lower availability of this resource decreases pup growth. Although the differences in growth did not appear to be reflected in survival in the first year (except in 1982), success 1987). Thus, a decrease in food availability is likely to have a greater effect on smaller individuals learning to forage independently 6 months to 3 years). animals may have success when are less able to territories and therefore, have limited access to females (Majluf females have less poor years. may affect the fur and breeding performance. To test these various information is needed on the changes (yearly, seasonal and daily) in anchoveta distribution and PSJ before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

' I Introduction As a consequence of human activities throughout the seriously depleted. Hence, there is a need to determine the status of the remaining marine mammal populations, to implement to ensure the preservation of those endangered. Little is known about most marine mammals in Peru. This is despite the fact that high concentrations of whales, seals and dolphins are still found in this area and that most of these species have been exploited for at least the last 50 years. Whding occurred in Peruvian waters from the 17th century (Clarke 1962) to 1986 and from early in this century, sea lions were hunted in high numbers for their skins and oil (Gamma Dulanto 1943; Gonzales Z6riiga 1944; Piazza 1969). They illegally by fishermen claiming they get caught in and damage their gear. The Peruvian fisheries for small cetaceans seem to have developed only in the last 15 years partly as a result of the collapse of the anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery in the early 1970s and has increased dramatically in recent years due to the deterioration of the economic situation in Peru (Read et al. 1988). However, despite this continuous exploitation of marine mammals in Peru, not even a complete list of the species found in these waters is available and for most, their distribution and abundance remain unknown. Since 1983, detailed studies of seals in the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem have been out (i.e., Majluf 1985, 1987, this vol.; McKinnon 1988; Read et al. 1988; Reyes et Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1986,1988a, 1988b; Van Waerebeek et al. 1987, 1988) and we are starting to learn how the most common species are adapted to this highly variable system. Also, through mammals to occur in these waters have been obtained. Here, we will review the available information on the marine mammals in Peru; riverine species (manatees, river dolphins and river otters) are not included. For the most common species, names (Spanish common name in italics within brackets), distribution, breeding (Table I), including those which are known only from a few stranded animals, will be listed (for full details, see Van Waerebeek et al. 1988). Fig. 1 provides a map with all locations mentioned in the text. With this review, we hope to provide a better basis for future management plans and to improve the existing marine mammals recorded from Peru (species with an * are illustrated in Fig. 2). Tabla 1. Especies de mrn$eros mrino reportados del Per6 (especies serialadas con * estan illustradas en la Fig. 2). Order PINNIPEDIA Family 1833) *B. borealis Lesson 1828 S. longirostris (Gray 1828) B. electra (Gray *Kogia 1838) Adult female fur seals in Peru are about 1.4 m long and may reach 90 kg (mean weight = 60 kg, Majluf 1987). No weights for males have been recorded for Peru. In Uruguay, they are around 1.8 m long and weigh up to 200 kg (Vaz-Ferreira 1982). Newborns weigh between 3.5 and 7.5 kg (Majluf 1987). Status and distribution: South American fur seals occur all around the southern coasts of South America, from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Paracas in Peru (Majluf and Trillmich 1981). There is only limited information on the size of the fur seal population in Peru. At present, the population is recovering from near extinction at the beginning of this century (Murphy 1925). By 1943, only a few small groups of fur seals were found in isolated areas in southern Peru (Gamma Dulanto 1943; Gonzales Zuiiiga 1944). Piazza (1969) reports having found fur seals in Paracas (13O55'S) during an extensive seal survey in southern Peru in the early 1950s. Other counts performed in 1961, 1963 and 1964 showed that Paracas was still the most important fur seal colony but a few other small colonies were found south of there. Grimwood (1969) reported Paracas as the only breeding colony with about 2,000 animals but estimated a total fur seal population of 4,000-5,000 (Laws 1973). The latest census of 1984 gives a total of around 15,000 fur seals in Peru (Tovar and Fuentes 1984). This is likely to be a minimal estimate because the censuses carried and diurnal variations in seals ashore. 80 75 70 65 Longitude (OW) Fig. 1.

Until 1979, over 90% of the fur seals in Peru were concentrated in three large colonies: Paracas (13'54'S), San Fernando (15'09's) and Punta San Juan (Majluf and Trillmich 1981). During the 1982-1983 of seals migrated to colonies further south in Peru (Majluf 1985) or to northern Chile (Guerra and Torres 1987). The 1984 census shows that some ~reviously smaller colonies in the south increased their numbers. South American fur seals are listed in Appendix I1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Breeding: fur seals are highly seasonal, polygynous breeders. In Peru, they reproduce December with 90% of all births occurring during a period of about 40 days with a peak around 18-20 November. Females give birth to a single pup almost every year, but due to high mortality, only one out of every 3-4 pups survive to one year of age (see Majluf, this vol.). Pregnancy lasts 12 months and lactation may last up to 4 years. As a result of this extended lactation, females than one young simultaneously. Females mate for the first time when they are three years old (Majluf, unpub. data). Males may not reproduce until they are 6-8 years old. Diet: The main food item for fur seals in Peru is adult anchoveta. They take other small pelagic schooling fish, but do so only when adult anchoveta availability is low (see Muck and Fuentes 1987; Majluf, this vol.). Young fur seals eat small benthic fish while they are learning to forage. Fur seals feed almost exclusively at night following the vertical migrations of anchoveta (see Mathisen, this vol.). Variations in their distribution fish. However, even though adult fur seals do eat anchoveta, the biomass they take is negligible compared to that taken by the fisheries (see Muck and Fuentes 1987, contributions and Tsukayama 1987a). Adults rarely eat valued by the small-scale fishermen; young fur seals (1-3 years old) may be the only ones eating small benthic fish (P. Majluf, pers. obs.). fur seals for their valuable skins is common everywhere in Peru. Arctocephalus philippii Juan Fernandez fur seal (Lobofin0 de Juan Fernandez) Size: Juan Fernandez fur seals are slightly larger than South American fur seals. Standard length of adult males is 2.1 m (Torres 1987) and for females, 1.4 m (J. Francis, unpub. data). No weights are available for adult males; for females, average weight 46 (J. Francis, data). Newborn pups measure about 65-70 cm and weigh 6-7 kg (Torres 1987). Status and distribution: Juan Fernandez fur seals have never been reported on land outside the Juan Fernandez archipelago (33'80's) and the San Felix and San Ambrosio Islands (26'80's) off Chile (Torres 1987; Guerra and Torres 1987), where no more than 10,000 animals exist (Torres 1987). Juan Fernandez fur seals are listed in Appendix I1 of CITES. From 1983, 10-15 adult or juvenile males (1-3 at any given time) have been observed hauling out in the South American fur seal rookeries at Punta San Juan every year mainly during the autumn and winter (Majluf, unpub. data). Mr. M. Rojo, a guard working at Punta San Juan between 1973 and 1984, reports having seen small mixed groups of Juan Fernandez fur seals at Punta San Juan (Marcial Rojo, pers. comm.). No females have been observed after 1983. Because fur seals are all very similar, it is possible that more Juan Fernandez fur seals occur in Peru but remain undetected because observers do not notice the difference between them and the more common South American fur seal. Breeding: Juan Fernandez fur seals exhibit similar breeding behavior to that of South American fur seals except for the lactation period, which rarely exceeds one year (D. Torres, pers. comm.). Juan Fernandez fur seals do not breed in Peru. Feeding ecology: There is no information on the diet of Juan Fernandez fur seals in Peru. In Chile, they feed mainly on squid (Torres 1987). Otaria byronia* South American sea lion (Lobo chusco) Size: South American sea lions are the largest otariids in Peru. Males may reach up to 400 kg and females 120 kg (Hamilton 1934). Newborns weigh 10-15 kg. Status and distribution: Sea lions have, in South America, a distribution similar to that of fur seals. Their northern breeding limit in Peru is at Isla Foca in Piura (5'13's). They show a continuous and uniform distribution along the Peruvian coast (Majluf and Trillmich 198 1). The most recent estimate for the sea lion population in Peru is for 1984 when 33,000 individuals were counted (Tovar and Fuentes 1984). Since 1984, the population may have increased because of the exceptionally good in 1987. Fishermen increases in the rookeries south of sea lions seasonal produce a single pup annually and may nurse it for one year and sometimes for a second year. The main breeding period for sea lions in Peru is between January and February but they have been observed pupping and mating throughout the rest of the year. In July, there is a secondary breeding period during which medium-sized males hold territories for 2-4 days and mate with very young, most probably virgin females (Majluf, unpub. ecology: Sea lions in Peru eat mostly small pelagic fish but are more opportunistic feeders than their diet is being carried out by Ing. Pedro Vasquez (Forestry Dept., Universidad Nacional Agraria, Lima) and should be completed in late 1989. Interactions with fisheries: are commonly observed taking fish from small-scale fishing gear and for reason, they are regularly killed by fishermen when encountered at sea. There is no estimate of the damage by sea lion to the fisheries nor of the impact that the killing of sea lions by fishermen might have on the whales are the largest of all living mammals. They may reach up to 30 m in length and over 160 t (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Females are slightly larger than males. Newborns measure about 7 m long. Blue whales caught off Peru range between 12 and 24 m for males and 12 and 26 m for females (Ramfiez 1983). Status and distribution: Blue whales occur in all oceans, along ice fronts and the edge of continental shelves. They are also found in deep oceanic waters and shallow coastal regions. In the southern hemisphere, they spend the summer south of 40\u00b0S and migrate northwards in the winter (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Mizroch et al. 1984). In Peru, blue whales can be sighted throughout the year but most often in the summer (~dez 1983). They are observed regularly north of Chimbote (09O04'S) up to 200 miles offshore, where most whaling operations were carried out. There is no information on the distribution and abundance of this species south of these areas. *Appears in many publications as 0.flavescem. Oliva (1988) recently confirmed the taxonomic validity of 0. byronia. There recent estimates for the Peruvian blue whale population. A total of 644 and 622 blue whales were sighted in 198 1 and 1982, respectively. Only 97 were sighted during the 1982- 1983 El Niiio (Ramfiez and Urquizo The population is likely to consist of at least a few hundred individuals (Northridge 1984). Since 1965, blue whales have been protected by international agreement throughout most of the world; however, off Peru they hunted until 1966. Breeding: Blue whales show no well-defined and most usually are observed singIy, in pairs or in small groups. Mating occurs in the winter over a five-month long period. A single calf is produced every 2-3 years after a gestation period of about 12 months. Sexual maturity is reached by both sexes at about 5-15 years of age (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Mizroch which to school close to the surface. A blue whale may consume up to 8 t of krill in one day. Most feeding occurs during summer; during winter, they fast, i.e., live their fat reserves (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Balaenoptera physalus Fin whale (Ballena aleta) Size: The second largest whales. Adult fin whales may grow to about 27 m long in the southern hemisphere and, as all other rorquals, females are slightly larger than males. Calves are born measuring 6 to 6.5 m (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Until 1967, the mean length of animals caught off Peru was 13.6 m afterwards 18.2 m. longest Fin also found in all oceans but are less common in tropical waters. They remain between 47 and 60\"s during the summer and migrate northwards during the austral winter, going as far as Peru on the west coast of South America. Fin whale migration routes are not well known because they tend in the open instead of along coastlines (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Mizroch et al. 1984). Off Peru, they were April the rest of year (Ramiiez 1988a). There are no estimates of abundance of fin whales in Peruvian waters. The stock for Peru and Chile has been estimated to be of no more than a few thousand animals (Northridge 1984). The catch of fin whales in the southern hemisphere was prohibited by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in 1976 but catches off Peru continued through 1977. Breeding: Fin whales are normally found singly or in small They appear to have a biennial reproductive cycle. Mating takes place over a five-month period during the winter. Every 2-3 years, females produce a single large, precocial calf et al. 1984). Feeding ecology: The main prey item of fin whales is krill. They feed only during the summer and fast during the winter. In the northern hemisphere, they may also feed on small pelagic schooling fishes (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). A few fin whales have been observed eating krill off Paita but this is very rare. Most animals caught off Peru had 12.6 and 13.5 m, respectively; Valdivia 198 1). Status and distribution: Concentrations of Bryde's whales are found in coastal areas of high productivity off Peru, Brazil, Venezuela, the Gulf of California, Japan and South Africa. Tropical populations may be sedentary but migration may occur in temperate populations (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). In Peru, the oceanic form is commonly found near Paita (05O05'S) in the spring and summer, close to the coast between December and March (Valdivia et al. 1981). The coastal fom is found further south, near Chimbote (0g004'S), more often during the fall and winter but may also be seen during the rest of the year (Radez and Urquizo 1985). The latest estimates for the of whales range 8,500 and 11,300 but these estimates been criticized as too high (Northridge 1984). Bryde's whales were hunted off Peru until biennial breeding cycle. Mating and calving through the year. Females produce a single calf every two years, after a gestation of about 12 months. Females attain sexual maturity at about 12.5 m and males at about 12.2 m (Leatherwood and Reeves ringens) appears to be extremely rare, i.e., one case in three decades of sampling (P. Ramirez, pers. in length and females 21 m. Newborns are 4.5-4.8 m long (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Gean length for sei whales off Peru is 12.8 m (~a&ez 1988~). status and distribution: The distribution and movements of whales are very poorly known. This is very difficult to distinguish from Bryde's in the field. Like other baleen whales, they migrate to and from Antarctic waters, feeding at higher latitudes in the summer. They seem to prefer temperate and oceanic waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Off Peru, sei whales were caught in the northern whaling grounds. There is no information on their status in southern Peru. Sei whales are observed only between July and December (Ramhez reliable estimates the sei whale population off Peru but there might be a few thousand (Northridge 1984). Breeding: Sei whales usually occur in groups of 2-5 individuals may in groups in 12 months, the females attain sexual maturity at ten years of age (at six in heavily exploited areas) and may reproduce every 2-3 years (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Feeding ecology: The diet of sei consists mainly species also occurs almost exclusively in the summer in the but off Peru, they have occasionally males. Adult females may reach up to 16 m and males up to 15 m long (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Off Peru, however, a male female humpbacks off for males, 12.0 m (Ramkez 1988b). Newborns are 4-4.5 m long (Leather- wood and Reeves 1983). Status and distribution: Humpback whales may be found in annual migrations along well-defined routes. In southern hemisphere, most humpbacks the in Antarctic waters and migrate northward towards the equator in the winter (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Johnson and Wolman 1984). In Peru, they are observed in the whaling grounds between May and frequently are estimates humpbacks off Peru, but they probably do exceed a few hundred (Northridge 1984). Humpback whale stocks in the southern hemisphere have been Peru continued hunting this species until 1966. Breeding: Humpbacks are usually found alone or in groups of 2-3 individuals but may form larger groups (up to 15) in breeding or feeding areas. Females reproduce every two or more years but are able to do so annually. The gestation period lasts 12 Feeding Humpback whales feed in summer on krill and schooling fish and fast in winter, as do most other baleen whales. There is no information on their feeding habits off Peru. Interactions with fisheries: Off Peru, humpbacks tend to occur shore in the spring (Rarniiez 1988b), making themselves vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gears. There is a single record of entanglement of a humpback whale at Punta San Juan in October 1988. The whale was released alive and the fishermen were partially compensated for the damage to their net males may attain 18 m in length although at present, due to intense exploitation of large males, few exceed 15 12 3.5-4.5 m long (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Gosho et al. 1984). Status and distribution: This species is found in all oceans between 60\u00b0N and 70\u00b0S in very deep waters and only rarely in waters less than 180 m deep. Off Peru, the highest concentrations are found around Pisco and Paita, the grounds of past whaling days. The highest concentrations off Pisco occur in the winter and for Paita, in the spring and summer. These differences suggest a seasonal migration between these two areas (Saetersdal et al. 1963). There is no information on their distribution south of Pisco but they are regularly sighted north of Punta San Juan and in 110 in the spring. There are no reliable estimates for the sperm whale population off Peru but it may be in the tens of thousands (Northridge 1984). Although singly or in small groups, they may form large groups of up to several hundreds. The largest groups are observed during the Groups can be mixed (breeding schools) or consist of only young males (bachelors' schools). Large adult males are usually solitary but join the breeding schools during the breeding the southern ovulate between October and February and produce a years, 1-2 years. Females attain sexual maturity at about 9 years when they are about 9 m long and males at about 20 years and 12 m long (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Gosho et al. 1984). Some aspects of the reproductive behavior of sperm whales Sperm squid and fish. The main prey species for sperm whales in Peru is the jumbo flying squid (Dosidiscus gigas) which occurs in very high densities in Peruvian waters. According to Clarke et al. (1968), the high abundance of sperm whales in Peru may be related to the high concentrations of squid in the Peruvian upwelling system. -- aBy senior length is about 1.8 m (Reyes et al. 1988). Males and females appear to be similar in size. Status and distribution: Temperate and coastal waters of South America. On the Pacific coast, Burmeister's porpoise occurs from Paita, Peru, south to Valdivia, Chile. On the Atlantic coast, it ranges from Punta del Diablo (Uruguay) to Golfo San Jose (Argentina). The distribution of this porpoise in southern South America is poorly known (Brownell 1984). Brownell the existence of two separate stocks, the Atlantic and the Pacific stocks, with probably the Pacific stock being the larger of the two. They describe this species as the most abundant small cetacean in coastal waters around southern South America and that about 2,000 are caught by fishermen off Peru every year. There are no estimates of abundance for this species in Peru. Breeding: Burmeister's porpoise usually occurs in groups of up to six or eight animals. There is no information available on the breeding ecology of this species (Leatherwood This is an inshore species which of these porpoises taken in Peruvian waters (Read et al. 1988). Lagenorhynchus obscurus Dusky dolphin (Delfin oscuro) Size: Maximum length is 2.1 m, weight = 136 kg. Males are slightly larger than females (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Status and distribution: Circumpolar distribution in warm temperate and cold temperate waters of the southern hemisphere (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Along the Peruvian coast, it has been recorded between Huacho (Brownell 1974) and Atico Breeding: In the S. Atlantic herds of 5 to 30 are common, but groups may several 1980). Data from New Zealand show a gestation of 9-1 1 months with calves born in mid-winter. Lactation lasts for 18 months. Off Argentina, young are born in the summer (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Feeding ecology: Dusky dolphins anchovies, and squids (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). In Peruvian waters, anchoveta is the main food, while horse mackerel, hake and by catches in small-scale nets, harpoons and purse seines are used. About 1,500 of these dolphins were taken in two Peruvian ports in 1985 (Read et al. 1988). Delphinus delphis Common dolphin (Delj7n cornun) Size: Maximum length with larger than females. Weight = not more than 75 kg. Newborns are about 80 cm long (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Status and distribution: Cosmopolitan, absent only from high latitudes. In the South Pacific, there are records from the equator to 40\u00b0S off Chile, on the Pacific coast of South America. There are no population estimates for this species. Breeding: Herds of over a thousand are not uncommon groups numbering many 10-12 months. Calving interval about 1.3 years. In the north Pacific, calving appears to peak in spring and fall. Sexual maturity is reached at 3 to 4 years (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Minasian et al. 1984). There is no information on breeding in Peru. Feeding ecology: Common dolphins are primarily 200 forms occur in some areas. There appears to be a daily cycle of activity related to the movements of the organisms associated with the deep scattering layer. Common dolphins There is no available information on the feeding habits of these dolphins off Peru. Interactions with fisheries: Common dolphins are taken in the small-scale fishery along the Peruvian coast either with nets or industrial purse seine fishery, especially the central Peruvian coast (Read al. 1988;Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1988). Tursiops truncatus Reeves 1983; I?eyes at al. 1988). Status and distribution: This species is cosmopolitan in all temperate, subtropical and tropical waters, and is present all along the coast of Peru. An inshore form and an offshore form have been described for this species in Peruvian waters (Van Waerebeek et al., in press). The offshore form inhabits the tropical waters outside the coastal upwelling zone and is known to range as far south as 13's (Walker 1981; Donovan 1984). The inshore form is restricted to the shallow waters along the coast and has been reported from Mancora in northern Peru (Grimwood 1969) to Concepcion, Chile (37's) (Oliver 1946). There are no estimates for the size of the Peruvian population of bottlenose dolphins. Breeding: Inshore bottlenose dolphins swim in groups of ten or less. Group size in the offshore form is herds of several hundred occur (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Sexual maturity is reached at 10-12 years in males and 5-12 in Gestation lasts 12-18 months. The is be about 35 years (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Minasian et al. 1984). Feeding ecology: The inshore form on mullets and sciaenids, while offshore dolphins have been reported to feed mainly on oceanic squid (Walker 1981). In Peruvian waters, bottlenose dolphins identified as belonging to Patagonian squid. Several types of squid beaks, some of them from jumbo flying squids, are common in the stomachs of offshore bottlenose dolphins, along with some fish species (Van Waerebeek et al., in press). Interactions is each year in the small-scale fishery off Peru, although greater numbers are captured by the industrial fleet in some of the larger Peruvian ports (Read et al. 1988; Van Waerebeek et al., in press). Offshore dolphins are captured mainly during the summer months when the width of the coastal upwelling zone is reduced and (Ballena piloto de aleta Males reach 5.4 m and 3,000 kg; females are 4 m long with an estimated weight of 1,200 kg. Length at birth is about 1.4 m (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Minasian et al. 1984). Status and distribution: Tropical and warm temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. This species was only recently identified in Peruvian waters (Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1986) and thus, there is only limited information on its distribution and no population estimates are available. The population of the eastern tropical Pacific has been estimated as 60,000 (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Breeding: Group to 3-3.3 m. season appears to be extended, while the gestation period about 1 1- 13 months. Calving interval is approximately 3 years Minasian et al. 1984). Lactation lasts a minimum of 2 years, although it may seem to migrate to inshore waters following the squid which are their main food (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Interactions with fisheries: Gill net and commercial purse Peru a few short-finned pilot whales every year (Van Waerebeek and Reyes 1986; Read et al. 1988). Orcinus orca Killer whale, Orca (Orca) Size: Males may reach up to 9.5 m and around 8,000 kg; females rarely exceed 7 m in length and weight. Length at birth is about 2.1-2.4 m (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). Status and distribution: Cosmopolitan. In Peru they have been reported around Chancay (1 1\u00b022'S, Bini 1951) and around northern Peru by Dahlheim et al. (1982). In southern Peru in recent years they have been sighted close to the coast mainly in winter (July-September) around Punta San Juan (P. Llerena, pers. comm. and P. Majluf, pers. obs.), Paracas and 110 Riveros, pers. comm.). There are no estimates or more individuals (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983). In Peru they have been sighted in pairs and small groups (3-4 animals). There are no data on the composition of these groups. Little is known of the breeding biology of this species. Females may give birth every two years or more. Gestation lasts for at least a year and perhaps several months longer. Calves are born around August to March and may remain dependent on their mothers for at least a year (Leatherwood and Reeves 1983; Bigg et al. 1987). A single birth was reported off Punta San Juan in 1988, but this has not been confirmed (P. Llerena, pers. cornm.). palatable organism of any is have been on virtually penguins, many kinds of seabirds, sea turtles and fish. In Peru they have been observed feeding on both fur seals and sea lions off Punta San Juan. On a single day they were estimated to eat at least 50 young (0-2 year old) sea lions. Adults were also taken occasionally. Majluf, pers. obs.). Interactions with fisheries: There is a single report of an orca having been caught by fish- ermen off Punta San Juan, fishermen (Cabello 1983). Average weight, 4.0 kg (IUCN 1982). Males and females appear to be similar in size. Status and distribution: Marine otters are found along the coasts of Peru and Chile from 9 to 56's (Brack 1978; Cabello 1983). They are mainly found in rocky shores but there are reports of occurrences in rivers and streams not altered by for crayfish (Hvidberg-Hansen 1970). The status of marine otter in Chile was discussed by Castilla (1981, 1982). There are, on the other hand, no reliable population estimates for the species in Peru. In undisturbed areas such as Isla San Morro Sarna (18'00fS), approximately per 100 m of shoreline (J.C. Riveros, unpub. data). This estimate is similar to that of Cabello (1983) for Chiloe Island (42'10's) in Chile. Fishermen report a Marine otters are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are included as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals (1986). In Peru, legal protection is limited to a short season when hunting is prohibited between 15 December and the end of January. This regulation appears otters occur singly or in family groups. The young are born in burrows onshore during the austral spring (Sielfeld 1983). Gestation lasts 60-65 days and there are 1-2 young per litter (Estes 1986). Feeding ecology: There are no detailed studies of the diet of this species in Peru. Preliminary analysis of scats by Riveros and Hays (unpubl. data) suggested that they feed crabs (Hvidberg-Hensen A and Bahamondes (1979) showed a are killed occasionally by fishermen for their fur and meat and sold as stuffed animals (Hvidberg-Heasen 1970). There appears to be conflict with the fisheries. ShelEsh fishermen are seen pen. comm.). However, in Pucusana (12'30's) entangled and drowned in P. Llerena, pers. comm.). History of Exploitation The Seals The use of seals in Peru dates as far back as preceramic times (>5,000 BC). Large numbers of fur seal and sea lion remains have been found in archaeological diggings along the entire coast of Peru (Bonavia 1982). were taken together the biomass the the diet Peruvians in pre- ceramic (Wing and Reitz 1982). In pre-Hispanic times, seals appear to have been hunted on a regular basis for their meat, oil and skins. Inflated skins may have also been used as ceramics (Bonavia 1982). L6pez de Gomara (1941) and Gutierrez de Santa Clara (1905) both describe seals being baked and eaten and their oil being used for different purposes up to the 16th century. By the first half of the 18th century, seals were only taken for their oil (Cobo 1956). Large-scale commercial exploitation of seals may not have started until the 18th hemisphere fur seal populations (Bonner 1981). Unfortunately, there are no records of the numbers of seals taken off Peru before 1925. From then on, there are yearly export figures given in \"tonnes of skinb\" for 1925-1946. Presumably, more than one company was involved in the seal hunt and the export figures include only those skins legally exported. To interpret these figures, we can use the following example: between December 1941 and Mwch 1942, a collected 36,650 skins (32,400 pups, 3,700 adult females and 550 adult males) (Piazza 1969), while 10,400 \"tonnes of skin\" were reported (for all companies). If we assume that these skins were mainly those of sea lion. pups with live weights of 30-40 kg at the most and that hence, the skins may not weigh more than 2-3 kg a piece, then in 1942 alone, several thousand pups were killed to make up 10,400 \"tonnes of skin\" and several million more complete the 806,252 \"tonnes of skin\" exported and 1946. Here, we assume \" 1 tonne of ski\" = 1,000 kg of skin without blubber. Under this intense exploitation, the seal population was had to be granted partial protection in 1946. That year, the Peruvian government limited the seal hunt to the period between 1 January and 15 March and prohibited the killing of young pups. In 1950, protection was extended to adult female sea lions and to all fur seals. In 1958, all seal hunting was banned (Tovar and Fuentes 1984). By June 1967, however, \"experimental\" exploitation of seals was again allowed even though the populations had not recovered. No records of the hunt after 1946 are available. Between 1971 and 1975, under the auspices of the military government, Empresa Peruana de Servicios Pesqueros (EPSEP) took 12,699 sea lions and 4,188 fur seals (Table a high proportion of the total population in each year (over 20% in 1974). This excessive catch must certainly have had a negative effect on the population. In 1975, only sea lions were taken. In 1976, all hunting of seals was again prohibited (Tovar and Fuentes 1984). Since then, seals in Peru have been legally protected but due to a complete lack of coastguards, poaching at sea and in isolated rookeries has taken on a regular harpoon which approach to and demand permission again to hunt seals legally. So far, these claims and demands have been ignored by the Peruvian government. Table 2. Catch and total population of seals in Peru, 1971-1975. Tabla 2.

In preceramic times, ribs and other large bones were used as building material instead of wood which is a scarce resource in coastal Peru (Bonavia 1982). Large vertebrae for grinding stones (D, Bonavia, pers. comrn.). Cobo (1956), a priest describing Peru in the early 17th century, also mentioned that whales were not hunted by the coastal people and that only stranded animals were used for various purposes. However, both Vasquez de Espinoza (1948) and Lopez de Goinara (1941) describe Indians in northern Peru and in the Atacama desert in Chile hunting whales using copper harpoons. In general, there is very little information on the early exploitation of large whales in Peru in the 16th-19th centuries. As mentioned above, whale hunting in Peruvian waters was started by North American whalers on their way to and from the Antarctic. These were soon followed by British and Norwegian whalers attracted by the abundance of sperm whales in these and Kapel 1986). These early whalers used sail vessels and whales being hunted at all seasons of the year off Peru, Ecuador and Chile between 1761 and 1920. Humpbacks only rarely were caught off Peru and Chile but were caught in great numbers in Ecuadorian waters. CThe fur seal population in Peru was at very low levels throughout the first half of the 20th century (see above). Modern whaling, using steam vessels and harpoon guns, did not start in Peru until 1925- 1926 (Clarke 1962). This allowed whaler; to hunt faster swimming and Bryde's whales) but sperm whales were still their main target. The catch numbers and composition early in this century is poorly documented. Detailed numbers and species composition of the catch are only available from 1936 (Table 3). Whaling off Peruvian waters in the first half of the 20th century was mainly offshore and carried out intermittently. The main expeditions took place in 1936-1938, 1941- 1943, 1947- 1948, 1% 1 and 1954. S hore-based whaling in Peru did not start until 195 1 (Clarke 1962). Baleen whales were caught intermittently between 1936- 1937, 1947- 1959 Between 1953 Table 3. Species composition of the whale catch off Peru between 1936 and 1985. Tabla 3.

Hunting of blue and humpback whales was banned by the IWC in 1966. Fin whales were also protected by the IWC in 1966 but were hunted in Peru until 1977. The catches of sperm whales off Peru were very large and during the early years of this century, contributed up to 20-60% of the worldwide catch (Fig. 3). Due to their greater size and their spermaceti, the larger males were preferred and thus, only few females were caught before 195 1. This preference was reflected soon in a decrease in availability of large males which caused whalers to catch a greater proportion of females after 1951 (Saetersdal et al. 1963). Between 1954 and 1961, there was a noticeable decrease in catch per unit effort (Saetersdal et al. 1963) but catches did not decline until 1965. From then and until 1982, when hunting of the species was banned by the IWC, catches did not exceed 2,000 animals per year (Ramirez 1989). Bryde's whales were the last species to be hunted in Peruvian waters. When most other countries in the world had agreed to stop whaling, Peru, Japan, the USSR, Norway and Iceland continued. The company running the whaling operations in Peru was Japanese-owned and most of the whale meat was exported to Japan. However, due to international pressure and after it was shown that there was no market for whale meat in Peru, all whaling operations were finally stopped in Peru in 1985. Year Fig. 3. Catches of sperm whale, 1910-1982, in the world and in Peru (from Gosho et al. 1984 and Table 2). Fig. 3.

Dolphin remains have not been found Bonavia, pers. orcas ceramics (Proulx 1983), but no bones of this species have been found in diggings (D. Bonavia, pers. comm.). There is no information on the history of exploitation of small cetaceans in Peru prior to 1962. In this year, Clarke (1962) reported that Burmeister's porpoises were sold every day in the port of Chimbote. Grimwood (1969) reports that dolphins and porpoises were frequently caught by small boat fishermen in ports such as San Andres and others. He wrote \"... the price they fetch, however, is so low compared to that obtained for fish that it is doubtful if they are fished for deliberately.\" Subsequently, Clarke et al. (1978) report observing porpoises in the markets of Chimbote, Ancon, Callao, Pucusana, San Andres and Ilo in 1971-1972. The first estimate of the magnitude of the catch of small cetaceans in Peru were from Mitchell (1975) who based his estimates on information provided by the Institute del Mar del Peru (IMARPE) and on unpublished data from K.S. Norris. According to his report, about 1,000 tonnes of porpoises were sold in fish markets every year, mainly Burmeister's porpoises, and a small number of small cetaceans are taken along the Peruvian coast, with higher numbers being taken off the central coast (Read et al. 1988). The development of this fishery seems to have originated after the collapse of the anchoveta fishery in the early 1970s. The most exploited species is the dusky dolphin, for which fishes. Approximately 10,000 animals were caught in 1985 by the fisheries, the meat being used for human consumption (Read et al. 1988). A dramatic increase in the small cetacean fisheries in recent years has been shown by Van Waerebeek and Reyes (1988) and has been linked to a worsening of the economic situation in Peru. At present, there is no legal protection for small cetaceans in Peru. Discussion The studies carried out in recent years have led to a better understanding of the seal and small cetacean populations in Peru. However, what we know about them is still very limited and not sufficient to design a conservation strategy for any of these species. Some of these are known from only a few specimens stranded on beaches and for most, we have only details of their anatomy and/or ecology. For the large cetaceans, the information available covers only the main whaling areas in northern Peru, while nothing is known about their distribution and abundance in the south of the country. Because commercial fisheries in Peru are aimed mainly at small fish, the major prey mammals are valued for their skins, oil, and meat and thus, with the present economic crisis in Peru, the impoverished fishermen are even more likely to hunt these animals, legally or not, to supplement their incomes. Management of the fisheries for marine mammals always deficient. were Peruvian Seals hunted without their being breeding pup production. Small cetaceans are still hunted in very high numbers without any population estimates. Both seals and small cetaceans are particularly vulnerable during their reproductive periods, when they are close to the land. Many species of dolphins and small whales are only available to the fisheries during the summer, when the Humboldt current is narrower and fishermen can reach oceanic waters close to the coast (Read et al. 1988). Fortunately, at present, the exploitation of large whales has been banned internationally and it is no longer carried out in some large cetaceans, for example humpback whales, also approach the coast in the spring and are likely to get entangled in gill nets. Human the food base of marine mammals. Once very abundant in Peruvian waters, the anchoveta population collapsed in the early 1970s and has not recovered since (see contributions in Pauly and Tsukayama 1987a and contributions to sustain large populations of former biomass of anchoveta necessary to maintain large numbers of sea mammals is no longer available. Marine mammal populations in Peru are not only affected by human activities. Being the top predators disperse (Arntz 1986) and so fur seal females have to spend more energy for foraging (see Majluf, this vol.). Particularly, they must dive to great depths more frequently than in \"normal\" years and the prey they obtain is of lower energy content. As a result, they are not able to cover the energy demands of lactation and their pups starve or have Adults also be if the intensity of the event is high (Majluf 1987). Similar effects of El Niiio events have been described for sea lions (Limberger et al. 1983). Small cetaceans can be assumed to be affected in an analogous fashion. Bryde's whales feeding off Peruvian were stomachs more often during El Niiio without such events (Rarnfiez and Urquizo 1985). There is no information of decreased foraging success on whale reproductive output, is likely to be negative. Thus, even though living in the rich Peruvian upwelling system allows marine mammals access to endure unpredictable variations in their food supply, which makes them, in poor years, even more vulnerable to human predation. Although we now have a better understanding of some of the natural factors affecting the marine mammals in Peru and of their interaction with fisheries, we still need detailed information on their life history, distribution and survival before can design considered. The tourist potential of ares such as the Paracas National Reserve and Punta San Juan, where large numbers of fur seals and sea lions are readily accessible and where and otters are be assessed. In other South American countries, for example Argentina, Chile and Mexico, there are numerous where whale and/or (Barstow There is a history of overexploitation of all fisheries resources in Peruvian waters and marine mammals are no exception. Nonconsumptive utilization of marine mammals a tourist attraction not only is an effective means of conservation of these animals through direct protection and increased public awareness of these animals, but also has the potential to continue to generate revenue in the long term. There is already a large tourist industry in Peru, and therefore, it be relatively straightforward to add whale- trips tours of this country. However, tourism has the potential to cause harm e.g., through disturbance at mating sites (Barstow 1986) and it is important that care be taken in designing and implementing any tourist scheme. Considering the depressed economic climate in Peru, and the relatively poor return from the marine mammal not be ignored.

Abstract New recruitment estimates of the Peruvian anchoveta are analysed with respect to other population parameters and the surrounding ocean environment. The inshore and offshore environmental variables differ in their dynamics, and the inshore series vary north to south. For the inshore locations, it is not possible to resolve if a wind-related effect is due or turbulence.

Resumen Nuevos estimados de reclutamiento de la anchoveta peruana se analizan en relacicin con otros parimetros poblacionales y el ambiente en que habita. Las variables ambientales costeras y distantes de la costa difieren en su dinhica, y las series costeras varian de none a sur. Para las localidades costeras, no es posible establecer si un efecto relacionado con el viento es ocasionado por el transporte o la turbulencia. Los nuevos estimados de reclutamiento difieren significativamente de 10s estimados antiguos, debido parcialmente al consumo del jurel que act& como un indicador de la temperatura. No ha sido posible aplicar modelos que utilii datos mensuales debido a que las correlaciones en la poblacicin pudieran ser espurias. Un modelo aditivo no lineal usando la biomasa parental y el transporte de Tmjillo, sobre una base anual, explica el 75% de la variancia de 10s estimados del reclutamiento. Introduction One of the main goals of the contributions in Pauly and Tsukayama (1987) was to estimate the demographic parameters of the mortality. marine mammals (Muck and Fuentes 1987) and bonito (Pauly et al. 1987) were included in the estimation algorithms. Muck and Sanchez (1987), however, and horse mackerel major predators of the anchoveta, with consumptions levels approaching that of fishery at its highest levels. As the mackerel consumption was not included in original estimates, new population estimates have been calculated (Pauly and Palomares, this vol.). population estimates, well as the corrected alongshore stress series in Bakun and Mendelssohn (this vol.), are the impetus for redoing the analysis in Mendelssohn and Mendo (1987, hereafter referred as recruitment, this reanalysis affords me the opportunity to delve in more detail into some issues glossed over in M&M, as well as to tie together some loose ends. In particular, the interrelationships among some environmental variables both the dependent and the independent variables. The algorithm did not produce in a form more analogous to standard regression analysis, (1989) number of eastern boundary current regions, including the Peruvian anchoveta. I reestimate these windows for the new data. Finally, Bohle-Carbonell (this vol.) examines fractal dimensions for some of the time series in Tsukayama (1987). I larger the environmental series, and show how these estimates relate to the models of this paper. Many of these issues were examined in my original efforts with Jaime Mendo, but were only alluded to in M&M. My knowledge of the Peruvian ecosystem derives from my working with J. Mendo, and while we did not work on this reanalysis together, I would like to acknowledge my debt to him and indicate that this paper would not have been possible otherwise. Data and Methods For the population data, the estimates of recruitment, parent and female biomass, and egg production in Pauly and Palomares (this vol.) and Pauly and Soriano (this vol.). For the environmental series, I use the corrected alongshore stress given in Bakun and Mendelssohn turbulence series (\"wind speed cubed\") in Bakun (1987), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in Brainard and McLain (1987), and the estimates of upwelling and turbulence for Trujillo and Callao in Mendo et al. (1987). For convenience, I will refer to the Bakun estimates of transport and turbulence as the \"oceanic\" estimates, while the estimates of Mendo et al. (1987) be referred to location. Spectral estimates were calculated for tapering the series using a split-cosine bell taper (Bloomfield 1976) where m is chosen so that 2m/n is the desired proportion of the data to be tapered. I have a 20% taper. Tapering broader. discrete Fourier transform of each tapered series was calculated as where hi = (2.ni)lT is the j th Fourier frequency. The raw (cross)-periodogram the overlapping moving average of the raw periodograms, I have used a value of m = 5, giving 22 degrees of freedom. Most analyses of time series data assume stationarity, or that be achieved after relatively short-term filter to the data. This assumption may not be valid for natural processes. Hurst (1951) the flows Let , sequence of flows. the cumulative flows up to time t are Related to reservoir construction is the sequential range R = max Sut - min Sut ... 6) Hurst (1% 1) looked at the normalized sequential (or flow removed and the result is divided by the standard deviation of the flows. If the flows are independent over long time scales, then one would expect that RIS - (Tl2) 5. However, Hunt (1351) found that for a wide range of river flows RIS - (Tl2)H for H in the range (.6,.8). This can be explained in terms of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) (Mandelbrot and Van Ness 1968, Mandelbrot 1971). Let B(s) be Brownian motion, a stochastic process such (Granger and Joyeux 1980, Hosking 198 1) described as where d is possibly nonintegral, B is the backshift operator, and the e(t) are independently distributed as N(0, 02). Note that this is not nonintegral lag operator, but rather an infinitely lagged in the autoregressive representation' (14). The and Porter-Hudak (1983) show that the power spectrums of the error terms from an fGn process I more intuitive, as it is a long-term extension of the usual ideas of differencing and filtering to obtain stationarity. (The first few terms of the expansion of the differencing polynomial are 1 1 1 dB - ld(l d)B2 - gd(1 -d)(2-d)B3 parameter based on regressions between the log of the theoretical spectrum and the log of the observed periodogram. The property of concern here is that a process has long-term memory if d is in the range (0,.5); the process has short-term memory if d < 0; and the process has infinite variance if d > .5 (Granger and Joyeux 1980, Hosking 1981). Both long-term and short-term memory time series models assume that the basic input process is a random variable. The main difference is that in long-memory models any impulse to the system takes a long time to die out. Another way to view this is that the system is sensitive to initial conditions. A small difference in two identical systems at a given time period will be evident for many time periods to come. Depending on the dynamics involved, the difference between the two systems caused by this impulse may grow, rather than disappear through time. The models in M&M as well as the ones in this paper, assume a relationship between anchoveta recruitment and other variables. If this relationship is on the proper scale and is stationary, then long-term memory in any of the predictor variables will not affect the system. However, the length of time ahead that a forecast can be made can be affected by long-term memory, as longer forecast horizons could imply forecasting one of the predictor long-memory another, direct predictor variable, that is related to anchoveta recruitment at a longer lag. (See also Bohle-Carbonell, this vol., who estimates the fractal dimension of of the series Trends in time-series are estimated sums of squares\" or LOWESS algorithm of Cleveland and the other is the decomposition algorithm of Kitagawa and points point. The regression is then made robust by weighting against outliers. I use a proportion of F = .05, which corresponds to two years of data in calculating the smooths in this paper. Kitagawa and Gersch (1984) assume that an observed time series can be decomposed as where T(t) is a trend component at time t, s(t) is a seasonal component at time t, A(t) is a stationary random component (i.e., and AR component) at time t, and e(t) is an error term. They assume a smoothness prior for the trend and seasonal components, which means that at some level of differencing the component is equivalent to a zero mean normal variate with unknown variance. The degree of differencing the of variance in the random variate causes a tradeoff between the smoothness of the component and the reduction in variance due to that component. This is the same as fitting the discrete equivalent of a smoothing spline for that component (Kohn and Ansley 1988). Kitagawa and Gersch (1984) show that this can be formulated as a state-space model and estimated The usual regression model has a response random variable Y and p predictor random variables XI, X2, ... , Xp. A set of n independent realizations of these random variables is and given a sample, estimates of the Pi are usually found by least A natural generaliza- ..* Xp) = z~j(Xj) ... 18) j-1 where the nonlinear functions sj are to be estimated. This is accomplished by estimating the sj as an \"average\" of some part of the data surrounding a point, in this case a scatterplot smoother fit using the backfitting algorithm of Breiman and Friedman (1985). In particular, I use the running lines smoother in Hastie and Tibshirani (1986). When the functions sj in generalized additive models are estimated using a fixed spa. smoother, then it is possible to estimate the degrees of freedom used in forming the estimate of q as well as an analysis of deviance table that is directly analogous to the standard analysis (Hastie and Tibshirani 1986; see Hastie 1987 for a good description of deviance and how it relates to sums of squares). This allows for a comparison of models using measures such as AIC (Akaike 1977), BIC (Schwarz 1978) or cross-validation. A smaller span produces a closer fit to the observed data variance), but with a greater bias degrees of freedom, equivalent to a with thus a tradeoff between variance and bias, as in most situations where extra parameters can be added to the model. Hastie and Tibshirani (1985) show how to construct 95% confidence intervals for the estimated functions s,. Environmental Variables There are a large number of environmental variables that could be used to model the anchoveta, but brute force searching through all of them can lead to spurious results. The environmental variables available for this study in all likelihood are surrogates for the actual physical processes that affect the anchoveta. It is likely, then, that the dynamics of the variables will be the important element in modeling. While each of these large number of series could be argued to be a surrogate variable, it is possible to separate variables that reflect more direct influences on the fish from those with indirect influences. For this reason, the SOX is not used in any of the direct analyses. The SO1 reflects processes distant from the environment of the Peruvian anchoveta. The changes reflected in SO1 wodd have to be reflected in changes in the more local environment to have any effect on the anchoveta. If, however, a local variable is a good predictor of anchoveta recruitment, and there is a strong relationship between the SO1 and this local variable, then there exists the possibility for a more extended (longer lead time) forecast. For completeness, I show with trends estimated using LOWESS. SST (Fig. I), shows a sharp drop through 1954-1956, and then a peak during the El Nifio period of 1957-58. SST remained fairly steady through mid- 197 1, and then peaked in the 1972 El Niiio. The 1983 El Niiio produced a strong peak in the series. A slight upward trend in SST is noticeable from 1971 onward. Oceanic transport (Fig. 2) has been steady, increases during and 1983. The 1960s appeared to have been a decade of decreased variance in the transport, and the mean level during the 70s and 80s appears to be somewhat higher. Year Fig. 1. SST off Peru with estimated local trend line. Fig. 1. TSM frente a PerJ con lhea '82 Year Fig. 2. Oceanic transport off Peru with estimated local trend line. Fig. 2. Transporte ocehnico frente a Peni con linea & la tendencia localestimada . Transport at Trujillo (Fig. 3) shows the strongest trends among the data series. Transport increased through the El Niiio of 1958, and then decreased and stayed relatively constant through the early 1960s. Starting around 1968, transport at Trujillo increased, staying at a higher level through 1972. Transport then dropped sharply till 1974, rose again till 1976, and then declined very sharply until 1982. Coincindent with the El Niiio of 1983, transport at Trujillo increased to a more normal level. Transport at Callao (Fig. 3) displays similar behavior, except that the drop in 1974 is not as precipitous, and the sharp decline from 1976-1983 is not noticeable. None of the subsurface series in Brainard and McLain (1987) are used in this paper, even though Bohle-Carbonell (this vol.) suggests that the subsurface has the strongest relationship with the earlier recruitment estimates. I note that, as mentio~ed in the article, only 20% of the subsurface data are from actual observations; the rest are from an interpolation scheme of unknown statistical properties. It would be difficult to ascertain to what degree any fit using these data was due to the actual physical process or due to the interpolator. Year Fig. 3. Transport at Tmjillo and Callao, with estimated local trend lines. Fig. 3. Transporte en Trujillo y Callao, con linear de lar tendencias locales estirnadas . SST also is not used as a of SST modify the amount consumed. In the model of Muck and (1987) for mackerel and horse mackerel, the biomass of these sizes, the relative SST bias. SST is also correlated with many of other variables, which may lead to indirect biases which cannot be totally avoided. If the environmental variables are viewed as surrogates for a physical process in the ocean, one method for selecting which environmental variables to use in modeling is to see what unique information (in the statistical sense) each of the series contains. If each of the series contains essentially the same information, then there is little matter which is used. If the variables differ greatly in the information contained, then variables should be selected a priori based on knowledge of the fish and of the oceanographic processes likely to affect them. Bakun and Parrish (1982) and Parrish et al. (1984) give cogent arguments as to why wind- induced transport should be an important factor in has that transport and turbulence indexes discussed above are natural starting points for the analysis. The SO1 will also be examined in relationship to these variables to see if it is reflected in any of these series. Bakun's estimate of transport and wind is based on averaging a broad area off the coast of Peru, and is dominated by offshore observations. The series of Mendo et al. (1987) are from airports by the coast in Trujillo and Callao, and these authors present anecdotal evidence that these series accurately reflect the nearshore surface winds over the water. If these series differ in their information, then a basis for choosing a series is which area (nearshore or offshore, north or south) most likely influences the areas where the anchoveta are spawning. The oceanic transport has the expected red noise spectrum at low frequencies, with a strong peak at a yearly frequency and small peaks at the harmonics of the yearly frequency (Fig. 4). Transport at Trujillo and Callao have a weak seasonal signal, and are dominated by the red noise spectrum (Fig. 4). The coherences between the oceanic transport and the transport at Trujillo and Callao are relatively low except at a few frequencies (Fig. 4) and the series are significantly out of phase. This implies that the inshore measures of wind and the oceanic measures contain quite different information about the environment. Similarly, transport at Trujillo has significantly different dynamics than transport at Callao (Fig. 5). The spectrum of Trujillo transport has a more dominant red noise component, while the Transport \\- based oceanic winds Frequency (cycles/month) Fig. 4. Spectral analysis of transport off Peru (oceanic winds), Trujillo and Callao (local winds) transport. Fig. 4. Andisis espectral del transporte frente a Perti (vientos oce6nicar), transporte de Tryillo y C&o (vientos locales). Callao transport has a relatively stronger seasonal cycle. The coherences are not particulary large, and the two series are significantly out of phase. A similar result is valid for the turbulence index at Trujillo and Callao (not shown). Thus, none of the three transport series closely reflects what is occurring in the other two series. The SO1 and oceanic transport have similar spectra, particularly at the yearly frequency and at a peak would correspond roughly to the occurrence of El Niiio (Fig. 5). The two series are highly coherent at these frequencies, and almost 180' out of phase. The same is not true of the SO1 and Trujillo transport (Fig. 6), where the main coherence is at the half-yearly frequency. The SO1 appears to a significant advance of what will happen offshore at the longer frequencies, but not of the more inshore behavior. Long-term memory, if it exists in the ocean, has implications for forecasting too far ahead any process that depends on variables that exhibit this property. The more oceanic series, such as SO1 and transport and turbulence calculated over the broad area, exhibit a similar, weak degree of long-term memory (Table 1). The more inshore measures exhibit a stronger long-term memory, approaching infinite variance. As I will be arguing that the more inshore environmental series are the most appropriate, the models involved will be using variables of limited predictability. 0.5 I- \\ Transport ----- Callao Off 0.2 Frequency (cycles/month) Frequency (cycles/month) Fig. 5.

Turbulence and though both wind-induced, measure very different processes in terms of the anchoveta. If the wind does affect anchoveta recruitment, resolving if it is mainly through offshore) is At Trujillo, transport and turbulence are highly coherent except at very high frequencies, and in phase at all frequencies (Fig. 6). As mentioned in M&M, the wind at Trujillo is predominantly from one direction, so that transport is close to wind speed squared, while turbulence is wind speed cubed. The difference in at frequencies appears to be one of scale, where turbulence is more variable since it is the cube of the observed speed. As I will be using mostly non-linear techniques to model the data, this difference becomes negligible. (For example, on a log scale, the two series will differ by a multiplicative constant, which can be factored into the parameter on the series. This would not be the case if the wind varied greatly in its direction, so that the alonghore stress differed greatly from the wind speed squared). result was found for Callao. Thus, though there are differences between transport and turbulence, statistically for the inshore wind series, it will not be possible to discriminate if an effect is due to transport or turbulence.

Instead, \"sampling\" is used to obtain estimates. Usually the sampling scheme is of no statistical design, but instead depends on uncontrollable factors such as fishermen's behavior. The actual data, or the observables, are things like catch and effort statistics, length distributions, etc. While a variety of schemes have been devised to use this information to estimate characteristics of the population, the inescapable fact is that only the catch, effort, length distribution measurements, etc. are data, while the rest are estimates. A property of calculating estimates from data is that degrees of freedom are used. In most cohort-analysis schemes, many data, also act as filters on the observed data, changing the importance of different When the same algorithm is used to jointly estimate many series, it is likely that just due to the estimation scheme, there will be a certain amount of cross-correlation in the resultant estimates. It has common to treat estimates of recruitments and of parents as data with the usual degrees of freedom. (Ultimately I will be forced to do the same (it is all there is to work with), but not without some careful checks on artificially-induced correlation.) In effect, recruitment estimates to estimate a relationship with another variable, I am fitting a composite function f(g(x)) of the original catch, effort and length data, where x is the original data, g() is the operation performed by the cohort analysis, and f() is the final relationship. If two intermediate estimates of this composite process strong cannot be said for certain that this relationship is real, or is just a product of the estimation scheme. Thus if parents and recruits are strongly related, it may be an -ce of cohort analysis. This will make it difficult to interpret many of the results to unknown degree of spurious correlation with the population estimates. Most of the transport series display a reasonable degree of correlation with SST. The new estimates of recruitment are shown on Fig. 7, along with the old ones. The new estimates exhibit less relative variation Pauly (1987) who wrote that biomass will be somewhat smoother\". Both series show an increase from 1957 to 1958, during El Niiio, but in the original estimates this increase produced a change in mean level in both parent biomass and in recruitment, while in the new estimates the recruitment level drops right after the end of the El Niiio. The new estimates start increasing from about 1963 to 1969-1970, after which both the new and old estimates show a similar decrease. The old estimates then show a more significant similar pattern (Fig. estimated AR component of the new recruitment estimates (Fig. 9) is relatively less variable of the old estimates, particularly during the 1960s. The log of the ratio of recruits to parent biomass three months earlier (Fig. 10) is relatively constant except for the El Niiio years of 1972 and 1982- 1983. The ratio with the number of eggs shows a similar pattern (not shown), though the decrease during the 1972 El Niiio is not as sharp. The spectrum of both the recruit series and the log of the recruits (Fig. 1 I), is dominated by a red noise component with a weak yearly signal. The picture presented by these graphs is of a highly persistent, stable series where the only significant change occurred during a one or two year period around 1969. In fact, the trend in the new recruitment estimates in and effort in Agiiero After all the corrections, except for the recruitment mirror the the new recruitment estimates are due to (Pauly tended decrease.

This necessarily mean that prewhitening the inputs is incorrect, but it does explain why there are such differences in the two sets of recruitment estimates. Comparing the parent series (Fig. 8) with the ratio of recruits to parent biomass (Fig. lo), it is clear that the trend in the log of the ratio is largely explained by changes is assumed. In the next section I will return to this point more formally, but it brings me back to the initial discussion of this it feature of the population or a feature of the method that jointly estimates both series? Data Analysis In M&M it was that the monthly recruitment estimates were so highly autocorrelated as to idea of intrayear variability. The new recruitment estimates have an autocorrelation of .99 at a lag of 1 month. Even after first differencing, the series is still nonstationary, with the autocorrelations positive and significant at a lag of well over This in the autocorrelation function of the Nonoverlapping averages can be formed to try to find a scale at which the series decorrelates and has a more stationary autocorrelation function. However, basis to achieve a reasonable degree of stationarity, at which point there is no reason to use anything except the yearly averages. Following 1953 is just the January value, as average, not total values, are used. Each of these series will be examined across years. Senocak et al. (this vol.), based on the egg survey data in Santander (1987), show that the bulk of the egg distribution throughout the year is inshore rather than offshore. From 1961-1972, for most months the center of the egg distribution is more northerly, around Trujillo rather than Callao. From 1972 onward, the center shifts, being at many times evenly distributed along the coast from Trujillo to Callao, or in some months, clearly centered at Callao. Given the differences in the dynamics of the wind data series analyzed above, this argues for using either the Trujillo or Callao series. As Trujillo is more of a center of the egg distribution in these charts than is Callao, transport at Trujillo, as in M&M, will be used as the environmental variable. As mentioned when this resolved at the same location. Additive models were estimated for the log of recruitment as the response variable, September and November as the predictor variables. The results in M&M, in Cury and Roy all that the degrees of freedom and the variance of the fit. The estimated transformations of parent biomass (Fig. 12) are approximately that of a log transformation in each case. Thus on a log-log scale, for the period April through November, over 90% of the variance of the recruitment is explained by the parent biomass at the time birth (Table 2). rC U) Fe b.- Mar.

Therefore the additive most periods of Recruitment was fairly constant until 1969, with a big peak in 1969, followed by a drop to a new equilibrium It is possible that recruitment parent biomass these models suggest. That then leaves open the question of why there was such a large parent biomass in 1969. Certainly the recruitment feeding into that was nothing special and shown), do not reveal anything unusual at this time period. The other possibility, of course, is that this is a feature of jointly estimating parents and recruits on such brought least Analysis of Deviance for Recruitment-Parent Biomass Models, April-November.

Time series of bimonthly anchoveta recruitment and the log of bimonthly anchoveta paper, do not seem to be there. It appears that all the adjustments in the estimates, while perhaps revealing interesting features in dynamics of anchoveta recruitment, have also limited the amount of independence in the data. Cury and Roy (1989) estimate transformations for the yearly averages the old estimates using the ACE algorithm of Breiman and Friedman (1985). For completeness, I have redone this for the new an analysis of variance, and given the correlation between transport and turbulence at Trujillo, starting with the variable of lower dimension appears wise. For this reason I refit this model using generalized additive models. The analysis of deviance for a span of .20 (Table 4) shows that the single best predictor is transport, which for this choice of span explains 60% of the variance. With so few data points, the fit does vary with the choice of span, from roughly 50% to 60%. In all cases, however, the fit due to transport was much higher than that due to parent biomass. When both variables are included, the r2 increases to .78, which suggests that there is of r2 for different values of the span was .68 to .78. The estimated transformations (Figs. 14B 14C) for both and are reasonably tight around mean and preserve the same the choice of span affects the estimated freedom, is unaffected by the choice of The fitting a smoothed surface to the 3- dimensional data (Fig. 15). (This is also a phase plot of recruitment for both datasets). surface unimodal and smoother. It is that the relationships on the raw scale are nonlinear, while those on the transformed scale are linear in each dimension. While the model only an additive approximation, it has caught the essence of what information is contained in the data.

Discussion I have shown that the new estimates of recruitment much smoother than the previous except for the sharp decrease following 1969 evident in both sets of estimates. Part of the difference between the two sets of recruitment estimates appears to be due to the fact estimates of anchoveta consumption, particularly that for mackerel, are for SST and cause the estimates to (smoothed) based on the SST series. recruitment estimates, so even variance in the monthly recruitment series can be modeled by a simple AR(1) model. It is questionable that this represents the Analysis of Deviance for Recluit-Parents-Transport Model, Yearly Data. Tabla 4.

The high degree of fit is suspicious, and may be due to the fact that both series were jointly estimated. This averages, using the average parent biomass over the year, and the average transport at Trujillo. The resulting estimates suggest that on a nonlinear scale, about 75% the variance in the recruitment estimates can be explained by these two series. The analysis suggests that large parent biomass, and a reasonable level of transport produce the best recruitment. Evidence is presented that these nonlinear estimates are relatively stable. Parrish et al. (1984) argue that transport should be an important variable in the Peruvian system, but due to the dominance of wind in a single direction, it is not possible to resolve whether it is transport, turbulence or some combination of the two (as argued by Cury and Roy 1989) affecting the fish. Even at the yearly scale it is not possible to say what part of the relationship between the parent biomass and the recruitment estimates are due to correlation from their joint estimation. This is compounded by the fact that transport is correlated with SST, and all the estimates by changes in SST. Unlike M&M, the present model, if valid, has much explanatory power but little predictive use since all terms are contemporaneo~s and art: averaged over a year. It may well models proper model, but it would be premature to do so at this time. More important at the moment is to study the various recruits and parents due to the fact that they are being jointly estimated in a model that uses up most of the degrees of freedom in the data. (Simulations based on model-generated data with recruitment a random variable, possibly autocorrelated, could give estimates of the expected level of correlation when none is present.) Further, some estimates of the likely base level of correlation with any environmental variable correlated with of a model would be possible. The yearly model in this paper, on the surface, has an intuitive biological interpretation, but this does not guarantee its validity. the new population estimates are valid, the existing interpretations of what has the anchoveta fishery have to be the level. A new mean level is then found, until another shock comes to the system. The most likely cause of these shocks are environmental changes, but as examined here and in Bohle-Carbonell (this vol.), the environment around Peru exhibits long-term memory, so that monitoring of the environment would have to become an important part of the predictive process. This implies that once local mechanistic models can be validated, then the use of surrogate variables, such as SOI, that may \"monitor\" the ahead, could be useful in forming a predictive model. I have not examined this possibility in detail, but I have presented evidence based on the interrelationship between the SO1 and oceanic transport, that this longer lead prediction is at least physically plausible.

Introduction This contribution presents a review of the major trends of biotic and abiotic factors in the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem, for the years 1953 to 1987, based on the time series data in Pauly and Tsukayama (1987) and ancillary data recently collected by IMARPE and PROCOPA staff. of this contribution is to enable fishery scientists and managers to obtain an understanding of the complexity of, and of the within the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem. Such understanding is necessary for economic management of pelagic fisheries, which are linked to the marine ecosystem through feedback loops. oceanographic parameters are available as monthly time series, for the period 1953 to 1982 or later: - Solar radiation (Bakun 1987) - Atmospheric pressure (Bakun 1987) - Southern Oscillation Index (Brainard and McLain 1987) - Total cloud amount (Bakun 1987) - Wind stress on sea upwelling) (Mendo - - Evaporative heat loss (Bakun 1987) - Net heat exchange (Bakun - content to depth of and McLain 1987) primary production (Chavez et al., this vol.; Mendo et al., this vol.). Table 1 summarizes the time series data of biomass used here for inferences concerning the major species Peruvian upwelling as well as some of the abovementioned oceanographic time series, all put on an annual basis. These data refer to the area off Peru ranging from 4'-14OS, and about 75 km offshore. This area of approximately 100,000 km2 shall be called here the Main Anchoveta (distribution) Area, or MAR. The \"match\" between time series was quantified using two approaches. The first of these was to convert the time series in Tables 1 and 2 into series of signs, depending on whether interannual changes reflected an increase (+) decrease (-). Testing was based on the assumption that when there is no significant match between two time series, the occurrence of each of the four possible combinations of signs (- -; + +; + - and - +) should be equal. Or more generally: the sum of pairs with different signs (- + or + -) should be equal to the sum of pairs with the same sign (- - or + +); this can be tested using a chi-square test. The other approach, also based on counting signs, involved the definition of a degree of coincidence (DC), computed from where 50 refers to the expected percentage of - - or + + pairs for interyear changes, and Obs pairs. DC thus has a value of 50 when all (i.e., 100%) of the paired signs are of the type + -, - + or + +, - -, and a value of zero when the paired signs are equal in numbers. DC values have been estimated for lags of 0 and 1 Results and Discussion Means and Coefficients of Variation Table 1 and Fig. 1 show that the MAR was (and in fact still is) dominated by anchoveta, followed by sardine and horse mackerel, each of them representing about 25% the biomass of anchoveta. Hake and mackerel, finally contribute(d) about 10% of the biomass of anchoveta. The biomass of bonito, guano birds (three species) and pinnipeds (two species) are, the biomass of anchoveta.

Fig. 1 also summarizes our scanty knowledge on zooplankton biomass off Peru, i.e., on one of the key elements of the ecosystem (see Carrasco and Lozano, this vol.). Although \"mlIm3\" is probably not the best index of total abundance, the data hand indicate a clear, declining trend: zooplankton biomass during the 1980s is only about 25% of what it was in the 1960s.

Change in the Growth Patterns of Individual Fishes During the 1970s see Fig. 4A). These authors suggested that the decline of anchoveta biomass enhanced the individual growth of aqchoveta, i.e., that growth reasonable in view of the recent surge of biomass in this species. the Peruvian clear shift of species dominance occurred among the birds.

Another better-known example is the partial replacement of anchoveta by sardine (see Fig. I), which is based on mechanisms discussed in Ursin (1980) eggs larvae between stocks. However, detailed of filtering rates a gape 4.4 times larger than sardine of the same the the two species (Weihs 1974). Hence, anchoveta should usually have a on sardine vice versa. This would explain the near permanent dominance, of anchoveta in geological time, (De Vries and Pearcy 1982) and identify the fishery as the key factor for the altered dominance pattern prevailing to date. The third of changes in species the relationship anchoveta and The contribution of Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo (this vol.) suggests that high anchoveta biomass correlate with low hake biomass. Negative interactions between hake and anchoveta are further illustrated in Sandoval et al.(this vol.), where high hake larvae densities are the of both their competitors of their reduction, in seals and sea lions, with sardine replacing anchoveta mackerel zooplankton when anchoveta became scarce (Fig. 5). The latter shift, together with the increase of sardine (a zooplankton feeder) may be the reason for the decreasing trend of zooplankton (c.f. Fig. 1). The purse in \"prey\" to sardine and anchoveta as the anchoveta declined. In fact, the drop in catch per effort which the purse seiners experienced in from 1972 to 1974 (Fig. 6) can be attributed to the time it took for the fleet to switch to its new \"prey\" (sardine). Population Dynamics of Anchoveta The El Niiio events which occurred off Peru since 1953 (i.e., in 1953, 1957-1958, 1965, 1969,1972- 1973,1977,1982- 1983 and 1987) have all affected the biomass of anchoveta (see Fig. 7B).

It is nowadays generally assumed that it was the combined effects of a strong fishery plus El Nifio events which control anchoveta population dynamics and that a combination of effects was responsible for the collapse, in anchoveta recruitment and biomass. The contin- uously increasing trend of even after the 1972-1973 collapse (Fig. 7C) suggests that it was mainly the fishery which prevented a recovery of anchoveta biomass in the 1970s. However, the available time series also show that a moderately not preclude an increase of anchoveta the period for 1958 to 1961, mchoveta catches increased from 1 to 5 t x 106 within two years while anchoveta biomass increased from 4 to 17 x 106 t. A similar situation also occud for 1965 to 1967 when catches were increasing from 7 to 10 x 106 t while anchoveta biomass increased from 13 to 19 x 106 t, and from 1982 to 1985, when catches increased from 0.1 to 0.8 x 106 t while anchoveta biomass increased from about 1 to 6 x 106 t. Much earlier work on the dynamics of the Peruvian anchoveta was based on the assumption that the guano birds were the major predators of anchoveta (Jordan 1967, Schaefer 1970; Murphy Muck and Siinchez (1987) and Muck and Pauly (1984) show that Year Year Year Fig. 7.

These considerations allow the identification of three periods since the onset of the anchoveta fishery in 1953. 1958 to 1960,1961- 197 1 and 1972-1987, documented in Table 4. The data in this table confirm that the and decreasing pelagic fishery replaced horse mackerel as a major source of mortality for anchoveta. Interestingly, no correlation was found between interannual changes of anchoveta biomass and guano birds, although one should expect the guano birds to depend strongly on anchoveta production. The probable explanation for this is that the sea birds are affected more by changes in vulnerability (an (Muck Pauly 1987). One can expect the sea birds depending on anchoveta to be also mediated via the fishery catches and by fish predation; this all suggests that comparison of signs of the biomass changes in two time series may not be the appropriate approach in the case of the guano birds.

Predator-Prey Disequilibrium The anchoveta predators in the Peruvian upwelling system (see Fig. 8) also be identified by these two categories: with regard to their capacity, they reacted to changes of anchoveta abundance like the opportunist Fig. 8. Major interadions in the pelagic off Peru. Fig. 8. Principales interacciones en el peligico frente a Perri. Strong ecosktema predators, i.e., they the purse seiners declined in reaction to changes abundance, just as the specialists did (see Table 2, and data in Agiiero 1987). As a result, the present sum of predation + harvesting capacity is equal to what it was in the 1960s, although anchoveta has now only one fourth of the biomass it then had. Or put differently: the total annual capacity of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem to \"consume\" anchoveta is about 5 times the average biomass, vs one time in the 1960s. This again means that the pressure on the anchoveta stock is nowadays much higher than in the past. This disequilibrium suggests that, overall, the anchoveta may have difficulties regaining its past high biomasses. Still, the experience of 1985 is encouraging: after a period of extremely low biomasses (1980-1983, see Fig. lB), biomass estimates based on two independent approaches (echo acoustics egg production method) indicated a analysis of the context this understandable: i) from 1983 to 1985 the catch/biomass ratio of anchoveta was low (Fig. 7C), ii) mackerel and horse mackerel biomass within the MAR - and hence anchoveta predation - were extremely low in 1984- 1985 (Fig. 9), a consequence of the abnormdly low m, and iii)low temperatures to disperse into a thus dependent checks on anchoveta growth. In the period between the 1982183 El Niiio event and 1985 was the most favorable for anchoveta since the collapse of 1971/72. The response of the Peruvian purse seiner fleet to the 1984185 increase of anchoveta bio- mass was to drastically increase the exploitation of this fish, which resulted in 1987 having one of the highest annual catch/biomass ratios ever recorded off Peru (see Fig. This excessive level of effort, combined with the reoccurrence of the high SST associated with the weak El Niiio of 1987 and hence of large quantities of mackerel and horse mackerel within the MAR predictably reduced anchoveta back to their present low level. To summarize the preceding paragraphs on the population dynamics of thus note: i) the fishing and predation mortality effort, predation determine the of the coastal waters by anchoveta predators (see Fig. 9). High SST in of anchoveta and of its predators largely determine the dynamics of anchoveta, and the ultimate fate of the fishery (Fig. 10). It is now obvious that the Peruvian pelagic fishery failed to account for interrelationships and both the crucial 1971-1972 collapse, and the non-recovery of the stock thereafter. This makes the human factor the decisive one, and strengthens the argument for an ecosystem-oriented management scheme. ,, Mackerel and horse mackerel + Anchoveta - '. 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 Year I- V) -2 V, Fig. 9.

Options for Management Comparison of the present biomass of the six major species in the Peruvian ecosystem with those of the 1960s shows a deficit of 10 million tons, i.e., the Peruvian fishing industry has now at its disposal only half of the reserves it has 30 years ago, when the Peruvian population was half its present size. The data presented above suggests that the reduction of the biomass of harvestable fish in the Peruvian sea is the result of overfishing, or more precisely, of a lack of synchronization of the fishing with periods of high anchoveta production. The same data also suggest, however, that the present knowledge on the dynamics of anchoveta is sufficient to anchoveta stock can recover after a collapse if conditions are \"favorable\". Favorable conditions occur if fishing pressure is low and predation pressure is low. Reducing the predation pressure on anchoveta involves applying a high mackerel and mackerel. these Anchoveta predators * v Mackerel, I I I ! I horse H. mackerel Competition Cannibalism (egg, v i.

A rational exploitation scheme for the multispecies stock off Peru would involve an alternance between exploitation of anchoveta (when biomasses of anchoveta are high and SST are low) and of horse mackerel and mackerel (when SST are high). The species composition of the multispecies complex off Peru provides three different options for the fisheries sector: i) production of fish meal and fish oils ii) production of fish for direct human consumption iii)some mixture of (i) and (ii) Option 1971/72 collapse pelagic fishes for direct human consumption (e.g., via canning or (iced) fresh fish) is still very much less than use of anchoveta (and sardine) for fish meal and oils. The main reason for this gap between stated policy and the present reality is the fact that fish meal can be easily marketed internationally, and that its price to marketing of mackerel, horse harvesting costs and the absence of an efficient cold chain along the Peruvian coast and into the hinterland. Thus, option (ii), meant to the horse mackerel. This would reduce predation pressure on the anchoveta, of which more would then become available for fish such positive loop could be contribute to rehabilitation of the Peruvian fisheries.

Resumen Las inter-relaciones entre las divenas contribuciones en tste volumen son brevemente revisadas a1 iqual que algunos errores en el precesor a Cste volumen. Se presentan ademh, algunos aspectos del trabajo de modelaci6n actualmente en desarrollo acerca del sistema de afloramiento peruano. Introduction The book of which this is the last contribution represents the proceedings of the \"Interna- tional Workshop Yield Prediction in the Peruvian Upwelling Ecosystem\", held at the Instituto del Mar del Perii, Callao, Perii, 24-28 August 1987, and the first contribution, by Csirke et al., presents the report of this workshop. This book, however, includes more contributions than those which were prepared for pre- sentation and formally presented at the said workshop. It also includes a paper that was con- ceived and essentially written during the workshop (Mendo et al., this vol.) in response to one of the formal presentations, as well as a number of papers that could be written only after the work- shop was held. This applies particularly to the reestimation of anchoveta monthly biomasses from 1953 to the 1980s (Pauly and Palomares, this vol.) and of their reproductive output and egg mortality (Pauly and Soriano, this vol.). The former analysis could be performed only after the anchoveta consumption by hake had been estimated for that same period (Muck, this vol.), which itself could be estimated only after the available estimates of the biomass of hake of NorthernICentral Peru had been extended from the last decades all the way back to 1953 (Espino and Wosnitza-Mendo, this vol.). In other words, this book presents a collection of closely integrated papers, of which the majority use time series data either derived or also considered other contributions. that the bulk of the contributions included here deals with change, this this book: \"Dynamics and Interactions\". *ICLARM Contribution No. 560. The above-mentioned workshop was to examine whether sufficient information exists on the Peruvian upwelling system for a simulation model of that system to be developed which would be usable for purposes of fisheries management. answer was a guarded \"Yes\". Yes, because the predecessor of this volume Tsukayama 1987) indeed presented a amount of data in both and analyzed forms - enough to provide the basis for effort. however, because fraction of the variability of the physical components of the Peruvian upwelling system have the characteristics of an unpredictable \"random walk\" (Bohle-Carbonell, this vol.). Still, it is apparent that the anchoveta population off Peru is is mainly purse seine fishery which, in itself in the Muck's contribution on trends from the early 1950s to mid 1980s, this vol.). Previous simulation models of the Peruvian ecosystem, notably that of (1975), emphasized mackerel, horse mackerel, bonito, etc.) of that system, not to speak of the guano birds and sea mammals (see also Walsh 1981). Explicit consideration, in a simulation model of Peruvian ecosystem, vertebrates mortality etc. Hence, we have included contributions on some rates (e.g., the growth and food consumption rates of anchoveta) e.g., contributions of Morales-Nin and of Pauly et al., this vol.). We are well aware that none of the contributions included in this book and its predecessor, nor the planned modelling exercise, could make full use of all the information available from the Peruvian upwelling system (especially those on anchovetagee Jarre et al., this vol.). For this reason, we document in Appendix I of this book a collection of fourteen 5 1/4\" MSDOS diskettes (for IBM PC and compatible microcomputers) which contain all the time series and other data upon which the contributions in this book and its predecessor are based. Interested colleagues are invited to from ICLARM, which is authorized to distribute them (for a small fee) throughout the world. This form of data exchange is quite new; we hope it will contribute to the reestablishment of an important principle of science - now seriously endangered by massive databases analyzed with undocumented software - i.e., that the readers of a paper should be able to reproduce the results included in that paper both in principle and in practice. We assume, obviously, that a wide dissemination of these data will encourage their further analysis, and hence will eventually benefit Peru, e.g., through elucidation of the mechanisms which determine the variable level of her fisheries resources. A recent contribution by Cury and Roy in this book's predecessor, illustrates the process we have in mind here. Another principle of science which is often neglected is the explicit correction of known errors two corrections for important errors in three earlier contributions (Table 1). I fear that while some will appreciate this information as an improvement to the book to which they refer, some others will feel that the existence of such errors - corrected or not - reduces the value of the previous book, and perhaps of this as well. Clearly, what we have here is a case of not being able to please all at the same time (see also Fig. 1). As suspected by Cushing (1988), the data in this volume and its predecessors are presently being used for multispecies modelling. This states (e.g., early to mid- 1960s or mid- to late 1970s).

The first of these approaches, presently emphasized by Ms. A. Jarre, is intended to serve two major aims: i) estimating, for periods the average biomass and/or production of elements of the system for which these characteristics are not available; ii) linking up the studies conducted to date on the Peruvian upwelling system with the theory of ecosystem phenomenology developed by Ulanowicz (1986), as The second modelling approach, P. the is reassessed on a monthly basis and into which a purse seiner fleet can be deployed. The catch of the fleet is then modelled, for each square fished, as a function of the biomass of various fish species which and environmental regimes. This approach, which is reminiscent of earlier work by Sharp (1979), is documented in Muck et al. (1989) and Jarre et al. (1989), where the abovementioned steady-state approach is also presented. Software and documentation for these models will become available in 1990, and readers may write to the author for information on this. In conclusion, I wish to thank on my behalf and on behalf of my co-editors, the many colleagues and other friends who have made this book, and the workshop upon which it is based, possible, particularly: In Peru, Messrs.

These original obsewations are available, along with their associated directions (in degree), also for Callao, for the years 1953 to 1982 in the form of ASCII files on twelve 360 K 5 114\" from Peruvian coast from 4-14OS, as obtained through the VPA III routine of the Compleat ELEFAN program package, and which were presented, for the years 1953 to 1982, in Tables 5 to 33 of Pauly et al. (1987). This file also includes information on the total anchoveta biomass per month and the number of 3-month old fish to the fishery. biomass are also included, as estimated Pauly and estimates in tonnes output are number x 109 (i.e., in billions). ANCHOV3.WKl contains similar information except that this pertains to the reestimation of the total biomasses and of mature anchoveta presented in Pauly and Palomares (this vol.), and Pauly and Soriano (this vol.), respectively. Also, the catch and catch composition time series were updated to July 1987 based on more recent data (see Pauly and Palomares, this vol., and description of contents of diskette 2). Diskette 4: Data on Predators and Predation This diskette contains the file called PREDAT.WK1 which consists of time series covering the period on monthly abundance and/or biomasses of the major predators and their consumption of anchoveta. The major predators included are bonito, hake, mackerel and horse mackerel, three species of guano birds and two species of pinnipeds. Also included in the file are time series data from 1953 to 1985 on monthly anchoveta biomass as estimated from VPA JII by Pauly and Palomares (this vol.). The time series of monthly nominal catch data in 1953-1982 from Tsukayama and Palomares (1987) and in 1983-1987 from Pauly and Palomares (this vol.) were included in this file such that any colleague interested in computing mortality caused by each predator does not need to use any other diskette. Three estimates of natural mortality, i.e., total (M), baseline (q) from Pauly et al. (1987) and baseline W) from Pauly and Palomares (this vol.) are also included here (see Table 2 for details).

Diskette 5: Information on Egg Maps and Egg Mortality This diskette consists of four files, namely: EGGNUM.WK1 and EGGMAPS.WK1. The first EGGNUMWKI, summarizes the data on anchoveta egg surveys presented in Santander (1987) for the period 1964- 1985. This file also includes derived statistics from Table 2 of Pauly and Soriano (this vd.) such as daily the anchoveta parent stock and of the sardine population, the anchoveta egg development time (in days) and observed and predicted total egg mortality (Z, day). Note that the column in the spreadsheet labeled \"midmonth\" represents the month on which the center of the sampling survey period fell. The second file, EGGMAPS.WK1, contains a detailed analysis, per half degree square of the egg standing stocks off Peru obtained from Santander's (1987) egg survey maps as performed by Senocak et al. (this vol.). The file is organized such that the column headings indicate the dates of each survey (from start to finish) with their corresponding \"midmonths\" (the same as the \"midmonths\" in EGGNUM.WK1, see above) and the map numbers (in Santander 1987). The rows refer to the different half degree squares (see Fig. 1 in Senocak et al., this vol.); the cells give the egg standing stock estimates of each half degree square. Note that the coordinates of each square are expressed both in terms of degrees (longitude and latitude) and as vertical and horizontal code numbers (i.e., X-axis and Y-axis codes, see Fig. 1 in Senocak et al., this vol.). The following two conventions were used throughout the spreadsheet: (1) 0.00 that the half degree square in question was sampled but that no eggs were found; and (2) -9 means that the half degree square containing this value was not sampled at all. Diskettes 6-10: Picture Files of Egg Maps These diskettes contain a program called DIASHOWEXE and picture files which allow for a graphics display of Santander's egg survey maps. Diskettes 6-8 contain the picture files of the original 90 egg survey maps as presented in Figs. 3 to 25 of Santander (1987), while diskettes 9-10 contain the picture files of the mean egg distributions presented in Fig. 6 of Senocak et al. (this vol.) as derived from the original 90 egg survey maps. Please note that the DIASHOWEXE program runs only on a HERCULES or compatible graphics card. It should also be noted that, in order to access the graphics from diskettes 6-8, the contents of all three diskettes must first be copied onto a hard disk subdirectory. Then go into this subdirectory and view the maps by typing DIASHOW LIST at the C> prompt. The program will ask for the user to press either the spacebar to continue viewing or \"en to exit. The monthly egg maps in diskettes 9 and 10 were arranged into two groups of 12 each, one for the period 1964-1971 (diskette 9) and the other for 1972-1986 (diskette 10). Thus, in order to view the egg maps for 1964- 1971, type DIASHOW LIST1 at the A> prompt with diskette 6 in drive A; to view the maps for 1972-1986, type DIASHOW LIST2 with diskette 7 in drive A. DIASHOW will then require that the user presses the spacebar to continue or to press \"en to exit the program. The next screen shows a title page in German which is here translated as: Simulation of the egg distribution of Engraulis ringens off Peru in two year groups (1964-1971,1972-1986) then, press the spacebar to go to the next screen which shows 1. Year group (1964-1971) Pressing the spacebar again gives on screen the \"climatological\" average map for the month of January and so on until the last map for the month of December. Typing DIASHOW LIST2 with diskette 7 in drive A will put on screen the maps for each month of the second year group. Note that pressing \"el' at any time while the DIASHOW program runs will abort its execution and the prompt. Diskettes 11-13: The Anchoveta Database The information available on the food and feeding and reproduction of anchoveta in the raw data sheets of Rojas de Mendiola (this vol.) and Alarno (this vol.) were used to create one DBASE I11 Plus database, consisting of 28 fields and 9,735 records in total. Each record represents one single specimen of anchoveta. A detailed description of the fields is given in Table 3. For the coding system of the available information see Rojas de Mendiola (this vol.), Alamo (this vol.) and Pauly et al. (this vol.). Missing information in the raw data sheets were generally coded with -9 in the database, except for the fields describing the food items of anchoveta: empty records for the latter (six) fields were coded as \"0. If only qualitative information on anchoveta eggs in the stomach was available, this information was coded as \"-9 in the \"ancheggs\" field. In this case, \"0\" refers to observation of zero anchoveta eggs in the stomach. Table 3. Definition of data fields in the Rojas/Alamo anchoveta database. Tabla 3.

For coding of the sampling positions, the center of the squares used for locating samples in the raw data sheets (see Fig. 1 in Rojas de Mendiola, this vol., and Fig. 2 in Alamo, this vol.) was taken as representative of the whole square and re-expressed in degrees latitude (S) and longitude (W). Erroneous entries the sampling location were taken as referring to the gastric part stomach; when two entries for stomach fullness occurred, the first was recorded as pertaining to the gastric part, and the second, the pyloric part.
