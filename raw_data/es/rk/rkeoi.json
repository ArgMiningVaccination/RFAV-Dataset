Volume 7. Number 2. April 2012. ABSTRACT Background and Purpose: While the popularity of instability resistance training (resistance training that involves the use of unstable surfaces and devices: IRT) is evident in fitness training facilities, its effectiveness for optimal sport performance training has been questioned. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to explore the resistance training literature, which implements the use of unstable surfaces and devices to determine the suitability of IRT for rehabilitation. Description of Topic and Related Evidence: The criticism of IRT for on the findings of impaired bout of IRT compared to training with more stable surfaces However, these deficits occur concurrently with minimal changes or and limb muscle activation. Compared also adaptations for coordination and other motor control issues, which may be more important for low back can improve force output which can then lead to a training progression involving an amalgamation of balance and IRT leading to higher load traditional resistance training.
