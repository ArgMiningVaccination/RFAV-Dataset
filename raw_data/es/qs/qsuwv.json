Deficient regulation is one of the leading causes of this crisis.1 The policy and legal framework in place is insufficient to tackle issues such as water use for different purposes, exploitation of natural springs, and exposure of natural water sources to contamination from agricultural and industrial activity, all of which bear critical ramifications for sustainability of life in the country.10 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, POWERIt stands that translates into deficient resource management, for inefficiency, abuse, and undeniable inequality in of access to water. affects people living in poverty and socially and economically vulnerable groups, including women. The country has a scattered series of norms that fail to cover the full spectrum of conditions needed to ensure justice and equity in access to the human right to water for all Salvadorans.2 Four out of every ten people in the rural areas of El Salvador do not have uninterrupted access to water, despite the presence of sufficient water supplies to meet the amount of available water in yearly rainfall above has one of the lowest levels of water availability per inhabitant in Central America and the Caribbean.6 According to information published by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in 2018, El Salvador came in near the bottom in a ranking of 27 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of annual water availability losing their capacity as reservoirs. Strategic aquifers have lost from 0.5 to 1 meter of flow rate per year. Of the 360 most important rivers, all except for one have seen their flow rate drop by 30% to 70%8. In an even more critical shift, rivers in the Eastern region of the country shrank by up to 90% from May 2018 to March 2019.9 The current and future availability of this essential resource for life is compromised by losses and leaks in the national supply system, impacts from climate change, uncontrolled human of this activity include overuse of actors from different economic sectors, and soil degradation due to deforestation and the use of chemicals in different production activities. As a result, the land has progressively lost reserves. Specialists refer to water stress in the case of El Salvador, which carries the risk of deepening the preexisting gaps in water access. The lack of effective regulation on water use and extraction favors economic actors by default, to the detriment of the water rights of people living in rural areas or impoverished urban zones. The situation for schools in the country is a reflection of this inequality \"(...) According to 2014 data from the Ministry of Education, there were over 1,100 schools without plumbing installed for drinking water. This means that over 10% of the schools did not have running water and had to resort to other sources such as rainwater collection. I visited a school in a rural area where running water is not provided by the State. The Principal informed me that they have to raise money to ensure access to water for the students. In the dry season, the school has had to resort to buying water at up to $75 per tank truck (10,000 liters)... The my visit and said: 'It broke my to see the tank trucks serve the inhabitants of a fancy residential area next door, when I had just come from asking for their help to meet the needs of my students'\" (Special Rapporteur, 2016).1011 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERThe Water Forum [ Foro del Agua ]11 reports that an area of 36,400 hectares of sugarcane plantation in the coastal region of the country can consume up to 205 million cubic meters of water for irrigation (5,632 liters of water per hectare) from season.12 Given use overuse and leaving local communities and settlements with insufficient water for consumption. A 2016 report by the Salvadoran Ecological Unit [ Unidad Ecol\u00f3gica Salvadore\u00f1a , UNES]13 estimates that approximately 81% of the water extracted from the lower portion of the R\u00edo Paz river (coastal zone) goes to irrigating sugarcane plantations in the area, while only 8% is left for consumption and household use in the local communities, and 11% goes to watering agricultural plots, pasture for livestock, banana trees and and grains.14 The causing especially in the coastal areas of El Salvador, drying up the traditional wells that communities find to consume into the aquifers, further deteriorating subsistence agriculture in For example, local communities have noted and denounced that the R\u00edo Caliente river in the municipality of Tecoluca, in the department of San Vicente, is running dry due to the excessive extraction of water to irrigate the sugarcane fields for the Jiboa sugar mill.15 16 In the community of San Carlos Lempa (also in the municipality of inhabitants also result of intensive sugarcane production in the area.17 Water extracted underground sources, even during severe drought years. These practices have led record sugarcane exports, even while rural communities face shortages. 2015 was a drought year18, for also a record year old-growth trees to clear commercial space has led to the destruction of a primary forest in the Cerro El \u00c1guila highlands in Juay\u00faa, a municipality in the department of Sonsonate.21 Communities in the area report that five manzanas (approximately 3.5 hectares) have been destroyed this way.22 This development could affect the water catchment area for the Sunsunap\u00e1n River Deforestation thus puts the human right to water at risk for over 264,000 inhabitants in the area and threatens the biodiversity ecosystems.24Box Threats water 12 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWEREl Salvador also faces serious problems in terms of water quality.26 The Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) has noted that the \"problem of surface water contamination is linked to regional development, urban settlements, industry, and agricultural activities that, combined with the lack of wastewater treatment systems,27 poor basic sanitation, and low environmental education for the population, put the quality of surface waters at serious risk\".28 Over 90% of surface waters in the country are contaminated by toxic waste and industrial heavy metals, poisonous chemicals from agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage.29 Due to this contamination, less than 12% of the rivers of the country can be used for the activities of human consumption, irrigation, water For example, the government had to launch an emergency plan in January 2020 due to potable water contamination and shortages in the San Salvador Metropolitan Area.31 Nearly 13 years have gone by since the Water Forum presented the first public proposal for water legislation in the country in 2006. By the time of this publication, over four proposed bills have been presented to the them have been passed. Additionally, demands of many civil society organizations, the legislative branch has not been able to come to the necessary consensus to explicitly recognize the human right to water in the national Constitution. In recent years, the possibility of approving water legislation strong resistance from stakeholders with economic interests. Many of these private actors are grouped in industry associations that wield important national influence, such as the National Private Enterprise (ANEP).33 One key moment that highlighted these conflicting interests was the submission of the Comprehensive Water Law [ Ley Integral del Agua , or LIA by its Spanish abbreviation] in 2017. This bill was drafted by a \"committee of water experts\" (a group with private sector linkages)34 and submitted to the Legislative Assembly by a group of legislators from right-wing parties: The National Republican Alliance [ Alianza Republicana Nacionalista , ARENA], the National Coalition Party [ Partido de Concertaci\u00f3n Nacional , PCN], Great Alliance for National Unity [Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional , GANA], and the Christian Democrat Party [ Partido Dem\u00f3crata Cristiano , PDC]. This proposal stands apart in several ways from other bills that had gained a semblance of consensus from different political parties in the Legislative Assembly and, unlike the LIA, enjoyed explicit and broad support from different sectors of civil society. Everything seems to indicate that the concentration of economic power held by the elites with the greatest stake in water governance (sugarcane producers, the real estate industry and bottled beverage companies), their close ties with the political class in the country, and the lack of mechanisms to limit their power to influence public policy decisions could be the explanation as to why it has been impossible for over a decade for the country to pass such essential legislation for people's lives.The Cerro El \u00c1guila area is not only one of the largest water reserves in the country; as such by the United Nations and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2007.25 Source: Developed internally from a number of WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 2 THE INEQUALITY BEHIND THE WATER CRISISIn the rural area, 36% of the population has limited or no access to running water, compared to 13% of the population in urban areas who have no or irregular running water.35 Access to water sources and household running water connections also rise in correlation household income. For example, 37% of the poorest households36 have no or limited access to water. 14 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER Box 2. A golf course consumes 1.728 million liters of water per day.Only 5% of the poorest households are connected to the public running water system, compared to 58% of the wealthiest households37 with these services.38 These and other inequalities are the root of frequent demonstrations and road blockages protesting the water services, shortages, and/ or long-term water rationing in rural and poor urban areas. Most of the wealthier residential developments and shopping centers have uninterrupted access to water.39, 40 People living in rural areas or the poorest households often may go for days without water services or with an insufficient supply that they store in barrels or other containers a potential breeding ground families walk kilometers to find water, drink water from a well or other very contaminated natural source, pay 10% to 15% of their income to procure water, or even put their lives at risk to find water, all while other economic sectors are paying relatively little for water.42 While the El Encanto golf course is watered with potable water to keep it green year-round, 75% of the population surrounding the club does not have water to drink. This is the reality for water access in the municipality of San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva in the department of La Libertad, where potable water shortages from 2010 to 2015 have left over 10,000 people to guarantee by themselves this human right.43 If there is no rainfall, inhabitants from these communities walk up to 1.5 kilometers down dirt paths to reach the nearest river. River contamination in the area is also part of the daily struggle to procure water. If families choose not to walk long distances, they must pay $5.00 (US) for someone to haul a couple of barrels for the household to use. Considering that the minimum wage in the agricultural sector in El Salvador is $203.00 per month,44 one can get an idea of the proportion of household expenditures that water procurement represents for a rural family living in poverty. According to some estimates, El Encanto uses 20 liters of water per second to meet the demands of watering an 18-hole golf course, which adds up to 1.728 million liters of water per day.45 At the same time, at least three municipalities in the department of La Libertad face severe water shortages.15 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER Source: Adapted from F. Pe\u00f1a (2015).46The Salvadoran state has failed to keep its promise to lay pipes, install connections, drill wells, and connect faucets to supply safe water for the households in the most affected municipalities of the department. Even in households that do have running water connections, people often go up to 20 days at a time without service, despite paying a monthly service fee. Faced with this absence of the State and excess business activity, people turn to water tank trucks to procure drinking water, and in the rainy use in household personal hygiene.16 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERThe crisis of water access and quality crisis are larger still when analyzed through the lens of the effect and impact on women's lives. Women take on the majority of household labor and unpaid care work. Salvadoran women spend an average of 19 hours more per week than men performing household tasks.47 This gap is greater still in the rural areas, where the difference climbs to 24 hours per week.48 The link between access to quality water and gender justice is clear. Water is necessary for cleaning, food preparation, care for children and older adults or dependents, and other activities that women a greater extent. These factors continue to limit their economic autonomy, personal empowerment, and political participation. Box 3. The water crisis is female.17 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERIn 2015, a number of agencies in the country warned increased extraction the Nejapa aquifer by the EMBOSALVA S.A. company (currently Industrias La Constancia, ILC, part of Anheuser- Busch InBev, (AB InBev), the main bottler of Coca-Cola in El Salvador), could leave over 30,000 residents of the municipality of Nejapa and 30% of the inhabitants of the department of San Salvador without access to water.49 Similarly, a report by the organization Alianza por la Solidaridad indicated that an eventual approval of the bottling plant's most recent request for expansion would exhaust the aquifer in a span of just 27 years.50, 51 The stark inequality in the distribution of care tasks between men and women means that women will be the most affected as they attempt to perform the water-intensive tasks. As part of a research study entitled \"Foreign investment in a bottling plant in El Salvador, the Nejapa case\", focus groups were formed with local community leaders to help understand the impact of the on people's lives. In the interviews, participants referenced that there are many single mothers in the municipality affected by the lack of water and that, when there were children in the home, the situation was much worse. Women expressed the deepest concern about the water situation in Nejapa, as they had first-hand knowledge of the daily difficulties that are caused by a continued lack of water.53 The study indicates a direct link between water shortages and the social inequalities between genders. 54 When broader groups of community representatives interviewed, a large number of women participated and described all of the negative impacts that the plant expansion could bring. Nonetheless, when a focus group was formed with respondents from entities that supported the as the inter-community board55), no women participated in the group, only men did. The study found that the bottling plant has undertaken a strategy community proclivity leaving opposing stakeholders - the majority of whom are women - out of the alliances. As has been the case in many other areas, women in Nejapa have taken a leadership role in water preservation for human consumption (water for life), and they have been able to mobilize the rest of the population on many occasions. This is an important dynamic because women carry the burden of household tasks for which water is essential, they are not usually taken into consideration in the decision-making spaces for control Although company reports having undertaken activities to benefit the inhabitants of Nejapa, the Municipal Council, social organizations, and the population interviewed for the aforementioned study all report that the EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER Section 3. WATER AND THE FIGHT TO REDUCE INEQUALITY: CONTEXT, ACTORS, AND THE INTERESTS AT STAKEBackground The problem of water and water-related conflict in El Salvador is deeply-rooted, and it is a problem that has grown more complex since the middle of the 20th century to the present day.58 Since its constitution as an independent republic, El Salvador has \"moved through three basic economic models: past three decades, this last model has been based on the \"application of economic liberalization policies and measures, open trade, and the reduction of state intervention\" (Artiga, has been a powerful strategic resource in each of these models.61 19 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERNonetheless, it was only in 1999, as part of the growing trade liberalization process of the Salvadoran economy, that a first proposal to regulate this field was produced. Ra\u00fal Artiga (2018) interprets the initiative as a need for the private/productive sector to ensure access to water in the context of the growing presence of foreign capital in the country. Access and availability faced even steeper challenges with the over-extraction and contamination of natural aquifers as a result of the production models that flourished under weak institutional controls.62 In 1999, after a series of closed-door negotiations with the government administration at that time, the private sector and a number of international organizations drafted and proposed a perspective in which resource regulation market (the water rights market)\" (Artiga, 2018).63, 64 This first version of the law never saw the light of day due to an adverse context: \"the political scenario of privatize the healthcare system shelved the initiative\".65 In the El\u00edas Antonio Saca administration from 2004 to 2009 (ARENA), a new proposal was drafted. Nonetheless, Artiga reports that this the government, with much secrecy, and prioritizing the support and blessing of the productive sector for the proposed legislation, which was not achieved\".66 The demand for a Water Law Considering only the proposed laws that have been submitted for consideration and public debate in the Legislative Committee on the Environment and Climate Change (CMCC)67, four basic proposals can be identified, introduced from 2006 to 2020,68 and three main stages of the discussion process. The first such stage ran from 2012 to 2015, the second from 2015 to 2018, and the latest lasted from 2018 to 2020 (see Figure 1). The initial debate began in 2006, when a first proposal was introduced in the Legislative Assembly. This Water Law (LA by its Spanish acronym) was introduced by C\u00e1ritas and UNES,69 representing the Water Forum. The Forum worked over the course of one year to hold a consultation process with different communities to design the legislation.70 The proposal was updated from 2011 to 2013 to include the human right to water, among other components, which was explicitly recognized by the United Nations in 2010. Figure 1. Water Law proposals introduced by FUNDE71 the Legislative Assembly in March 2019. 20 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWEROn March 22, 2012, in honor of World Water Day and based on the proposal from the Water Forum, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) submitted the G eneral Water Law (LGA by its Spanish abbreviation), which eventually earned the support of the Forum. In 2013, another proposal called the Comprehensive Water Management Law (LGIA by its Spanish abbreviation) was submitted by the private sector (El Cacao Irrigators Association)72, with advisory support from the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FUSADES).73, 74 In June 2017, a group with private sector ties calling itself the \"Water Experts Committee\" submitted a new proposal entitled the Comprehensive Water Law (LIA by its Spanish abbreviation), with support from the block of right-wing political parties: ARENA, GANA, PCN, and PDC. Two months later, the \"Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as\" Central American University (UCA) published a proposal for a water governing institution, emphasizing which sectors should be regulatory decisions. It is worth noting that in 2014 and 2015, MARN, the Ministry of the Economy (MINEC), and ANEP carried out dialogues in the country on the regulations of water assets. These discussions produced a technical was Assembly.75 According to a MARN representative, this proposal served as the basis for the LIA, but the private sector modified the content before submitting it to the legislature.76 Figure 2. Discussion on the Water Law in the Assembly from 2012 to 2021 Source: Developed internally based on remarks by FUNDE to the Legislative Assembly in March 2019. 21 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWEROver the three periods of debate in the Legislative Assembly, most of the progress toward possible water legislation came from 2012 to 2015. The CMCC at that time was chaired by Francis Zablah, a legislator from the GANA party. This stage also coincides with the final three years of the Mauricio Funes administration in the executive branch (from June 1, 2009 to June 1, 2014) under the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN).77 Funes was the first president elected from a left-wing party in El Salvador. Working off of the MARN proposal from 2012, the Legislative Assembly underway around the proposed bill.78 It is important to add that over 100,000 signatures were gathered in the course of this consultation process to support the recognition and development of the human right to water in the national legal framework.79 The dynamic social movement of the time and the openness of the Legislative Assembly succeeded in actors.80 The Legislative Assembly reached agreements on 92 the 200 in the proposed LGA promoted by MARN, and supported by the Water Forum and a broad and significant sector of the citizens and government of the time. Despite this progress, the Assembly failed to come to agreement on critical aspects such as the institutional structure for water management. The proposal to recognize the human right to water in the Constitution of the Republic also stagnated. The discussion of the MARN LGA continued in the next legislative session from 2015 to 2018, but less progress was made compared to the previous period. The Chairman of the CMCC at that time was FMLN legislator Guillermo Mata Bennet. The President of El Salvador was Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n, from the same party. According to FUNDE, the most important achievement in this period was the passage of a proposal to create an autonomous agency that would be in charge of water stewardship.81 This would turn out to be a central point in the debate, as explained below. Since 2017, the political debate to approve a pertinent water law has stopped, mainly due to the disruptive effect of the introducing the LIA, which broke the agreements reached up to 2015, and marked the start of the recent, strong conflict in the country around possible water legislation. In addition, for a large part of 2018, the run-up to the presidential elections that would be held 3, as an to justify the new paralysis in the legislative process. In May 2018, the new of the CMCC for the 2018-2021 legislative session,82 chaired by Martha Evelyn to restart the discussion entirely. had been constructed previously were discarded, and the LIA (not the LGA that had been introduced by MARN) was used as the framework for the new debate. According to FUNDE, from 2018 to the present, no progress has been made on substantive aspects on institutional arrangements in the law. Since 2017, the main points of disagreement have been the different alternatives for the existing institutional framework: the proposals from the LGA, LIA, and the UCA proposal. In fact, the Minister of the Environment at the time, Lina Pohl, published an article stating that 85% of the proposal introduced by the private sector in 2017 was fairly similar to the text produced by the discussions and debates with ANEP in 2014 and 2015 (that is, in large part aligned with the MARN proposal), and the problem was the remaining 15% that was holding up the process.83 Along these lines, the main aspect driving conflict in the debate was the composition of the regulatory body. In the initial version, the LIA proposed a five-person board of directors: two representatives designated by the Corporation of Municipal Governments of El Salvador (COMURES)84, two by ANEP, and one person appointed by the President of the Republic. In this regard, the LIA clearly prioritized private-sector representation on this body. This composition 22 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERis at the core of the conflict, pitting opposing visions for the structure of the governing body and who should have a seat at the table. In the balance was who would have the power to decide over water management, national water policy, national and local plans, regulations, permits, and rates for water use, among other issues. The elites who use water as part of their economic activities thus had more than a passing in as seen in the proposals submitted by 2018, the CMCC decision to restart discussions based only on sparked a number of large-scale marches demanding a general water law with a strong public institution, and the recognition of the human right to water in the Constitution.85, 86 In the second half of 2018, a national movement coalesced against what was seen as an attempt to privatize water by taking control of the After intense citizen protest, the Legislative Assembly held series of hearings to give voice to the positions from the different social sectors. hearings in between a conflict with no apparent solution and the electoral context, the discussion on a legal framework for comprehensive water management has remained in limbo.89 Opposing visions: The LGA, LIA, and regulatory body proposed by the UCA As for the general content of the laws, and as inferred in the previous paragraphs, the current confrontation is between the latest version of the LGA proposed by MARN, and the LIA, supported by the private sector and proposed by ARENA, GANA, PCN, and PDC. In terms of the specific question of the institutional structure, currently two staked out in the conflict: the UCA proposal (backed by MARN and different social stakeholders and organizations), and the private sector position (updating the initial 2017 proposal by increasing the representatives designated by the president of the republic from 1 to 3 appointees).90 Figure 3. remarks by FUNDE to the Legislative Assembly in March 2019. 23 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERTable 1. Opposing visions on the General Water Law (LGA) and the Comprehensive Water Law (LIA) Sources: Developed internally based Legislative Assembly: University of El Salvador (UES), Salvadoran Chamber of Construction Industry (CASALCO), Movement of Defense of opinions shared in interviews conducted for this research project.The main points in dispute are in regard to the nature of the governing body for water resources (with a majority public stake in the UCA proposal, and with a majority representation from the private sector in the LIA, including two members appointed in the law. There are also differences between the LGA and LIA on other specific issues such as the permits to exploit water sources (setting time limits and volumes), the system of penalties in cases of non-compliance, rates for water extraction and and sanitation ANEP critiques of the LGAUniversity and of the LIA The institutional structure proposed by the LGA is discretionary and arbitrary.92 Article 120 of the LGA grants discretionary and arbitrary powers to MARN that would years for private any time insecurity\". to of wastewater water sources.96 The LGA establishes a confiscatory sanction rules with the creation of the Water Sanctions Tribunal with three members appointed by the president of the republic.97 The law looks to shift authority over a public resource such as water into private hands or agents, which would put water access at risk for a large swath of the population. It does not guarantee priority water use for human consumption. Unlike the State, the private sector has no mandate, mission, or authority to uphold the common good or to defend citizens' rights. While some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have adopted different formats in which the private sector is involved in water management, none of them involve private actors in the governing body.24 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERANEP critiques of the UCA proposalUniversity social movement organization the proposed be held by a decentralized, autonomous authority for comprehensive water management. This authority should not be under the authority of the executive branch, that is, it should not be an official autonomous institution or a ministry, but rather a decentralized institution free from political interests. The most favorable governance structure is one that transcends administrations. The governing should be apolitical. The body for water should be composed of public actors; other actors on the body would face conflict of interests in deciding on different water uses and volumes, rates, fines for wastewater dumping, and other critical issues. The water authority proposed in the LIA prioritizes private participation and puts State representatives at a disadvantage against the block of two private sector representatives together with the COMURES appointees. The LIA proposes a Watershed Consulting Committee, but delegates all decision-making powers to the central water authority. That is, the LIA proposes a Consulting Committee that can be convened and invited to board meetings to share their opinions, but the committee is not given a vote. In comparison, the space proposed by the UCA suggests Water Council with broad participation, which would elect two of its members to join the board of directors of the National Water Authority (ANA). The LIA excludes members of political parties, labor unions or elected officials from participating on the board of directors of the Water Authority. The lack of civil society participation prevents full recognition of indigenous peoples' views and voices from the communities that have been key actors in the local struggles for water rights. Water is a public good, and thus policies for water management should be led by the State. Given the essential importance of water for life, helps to to favor transparency in water governance. Decentralizing water management (in local committees and watershed zones) as suggested by the UCA is a key adaptation to protect water sources and watersheds, and deal with the effects of climate change.Table 2. Main critiques shared the interviews conducted as part of this research project.25 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERTables 1 and 2 clearly show the private sector concerns and may be behind their interest in controlling decisions that could put the profitability of their production activities at risk. While some parts of the ANEP position are reasonable, such as the need to improve the efficiency of the National Aqueducts and Sewers Administration to waste, or politicizing the governing body, the essential notion that water is a vital public good and that human consumption should be prioritized over the use of water as a raw material in production is absent. The detractors of the LIA are clear in making this argument. It is also worth noting that while the language of the LGA is more gender-inclusive, neither the LGA nor the LIA approach the issue of water management with an adequate gender lens. This report will further explore the gender lens in the section on recommendations. WATER, ELITES, AND POWER The lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework for water management means that there is no regulation in place for fundamental issues such as the exploitation of aquifers and for different consumption types, consumption rates, and prevention and control measures to avoid contamination (discharges into water sources), along with other points. This lack of regulation and the fragmentation of different roles across a spectrum of agencies without a single governing body to coordinate comprehensive water management has been a breeding ground for the proliferation of abuses and excess that has led to a large part of the water crisis in El Salvador. Social movement actors, consumer defense organizations, and non-governmental organizations all agreed in the interviews conducted for this research that companies from three main sectors make up the staunchest opposition to the LGA and a public institutional structure as proposed by the UCA. These sectors are: agroindustry in general (and sugarcane in particular), industrial and non-alcoholic beverages), and construction (urban infrastructure development). Representatives the water rights defense movement and academic actors agree that the current model, and without adequate payment system has ended up prioritizing water use for a handful of companies from these sectors.98 Therefore, behind the inaction water crisis, interests of the country's economic elite can be identified. This does not invalidate the fact that there are other interests at play associated with other actors that also explains part of the paralysis. Nonetheless, the strong motivations of these companies to block the passage of a regulatory framework on the subject - until such an omission becomes untenable - support for the LIA and rejecting the MARN/UCA proposal is indisputable. In the political field, the ARENA party has been one of the most influential actors in the discussions for a water law in the country. As shown, while this party resisted any progress on water legislation for many years,99 ARENA joined representatives from GANA, PCN, and PDC to introduce the LIA legislation granting a majority stake of participation to the private sector in the governing body in August 2017. The ARENA party has had close ties to the Salvadoran economic elite since its founding,100 and prominent businessmen continue to be among the main donors to the party. In recent years, after a long legal battle, political parties have begun to disclose their donors. According to these records, the ARENA party received 470 private donations from February 2015 to May 2016. Among the contributions that stand out are from five big Salvadoran businesses that operate in sectors, as indicated above, that sources have identified as those with the most resistance to the approval of water legislation. 101 The largest donors are: the Grupo 26 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERPoma companies, in the automobile sector, financial services, industry, and real estate,102, 103 (property of the Poma family); the Omnisport company (linked to the Suster family); the Roberto Due\u00f1as Limitada and Due\u00f1as Hermanos Limitada real estate companies (both owned by the Due\u00f1as family, which also owns Urb\u00e1nica Desarrollos Inmobililiaros and has been the builder of luxury urban developments such as Puerta la Castellana, Puerta Los Faros, La Gran V\u00eda Mall, and others,104 and, which Segovia (2018) reports, also holds operations in sugarcane production, transformation, sale, and export, and in private investment funds;105 Compa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a and Almacenadora del Pac\u00edfico S.A. de C.V. (linked to the Regalado family);106 Credisiman and Desarrollos Inmobiliarios Comerciales S.A. de C.V. (linked to the Sim\u00e1n family);107 and Droguer\u00eda of former president Alfredo Cristiani).108 The sugarcane sector stands out as a major player among the ARENA party donors. In fact, in March 2018, a group of churches, organized in the National Alliance against Water Privatization in El Salvador, sent a letter to the Legislative Assembly to share their concerns caused by the data published by the Presidential Secretariat for Citizen Participation, Transparency and Anti- Corruption, demonstrating CASSA [the Salvadoran Sugar Company, or Compan\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a ], and the El \u00c1ngel, La Caba\u00f1a, Chaparristique and Jiboa sugar mills had all made important payments to the ARENA party.110 These companies, along with a number of others, are organized in different industry groups that make up the National Private Enterprise Association (ANEP), founded in 1966 to be a body that would represent much of the private sector in the country. ANEP's mission is to \"foster and protect a system of free enterprise\", and its vision is \"to be the entity that promotes and sustainable data its webpage, ANEP \"represents the productive and economic strength of El Salvador, with 50 business groups from 55 economic subsectors, representing over 15,000 companies.\"111 Given role in the governance of El Salvador. ANEP functions as a network of domestic and multinational companies (banks, airlines, industries, etc.) with political ties in the country. In fact, some of the members hesitate to publicly recognize body, the Association has wielded influence in political and economic realms, providing information and recommendations for the governments in power.112 Beginning in 1989,113 the industry groups began to have more visible influence in the country. For example, high-ranking representatives in ANEP have run and been elected to public office, often under the auspices of the ARENA party (one former president of ANEP was elected as President of El Salvador through the ARENA party.)114 This reveals the linkages between both actors and their considerable influence in key aspects of national life.115 Among governance are the Salvadoran Sugarcane Association [Asociaci\u00f3n Azucarera de El Salvador ], the Chamber of Agriculture and Agroindustry of El Salvador [ C\u00e1mara Agropecuaria y Agroindustrial de El Salvador, CAMAGRO ], the Association of Sugarcane Producers [ Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Ca\u00f1a de Az\u00facar, PROCA\u00d1A ], the Salvadoran Association of Bottled Water Industries [ Asociaci\u00f3n Salvadore\u00f1a de Industrias de Agua Envasada, ASIAGUA ], the Salvadoran Chamber of the Construction Industry [ C\u00e1mara Salvadore\u00f1a de la Industria de la Construcci\u00f3n, CASALCO ], the American Chamber of Commerce in El Salvador (AMCHAM), and the Salvadoran Industrial Association (ASI, which brings together large companies such as the Embotelladora La Cascada bottling 27 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERcompany, Industrias La Constancia, and others from agroindustry such as Arrocera San Francisco, CASSA, or Derivados de Ma\u00edz de El Salvador). ASI represents the interests of its members dedicated to industrial or associated activities,117 and the association reports that its members account for 96.5% of the exports from the country.118 One of the ASI mandates is to protect and represent the interests of its members before national and international authorities and institutions, and to to members' interests, acting as an for their requests of the central government.\"119 The sugarcane sector, which includes the Salvadoran Sugarcane Association (and PROCA\u00d1A, which represents the cane producers) is a very important part of the national economy, and one which makes intensive use of water resources in the country. According to data from MARN in 2017, the sectors with the greatest demand for water in El Salvador were agriculture (51.8%), urban and rural household water supply (29.7%), and thermal energy (11.5%). These three demand of water-intensive crops. Along with climate conditions, water availability is the factor for crop coefficients (Kc) established by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Association (FAO) for plant development (cultivation-growth- flowering-harvest). Kc most vegetable crops is between 0.60 and 0.75.121 There are six sugar mills in the country (Central Izalco, Chaparrastique, El \u00c1ngel, La Caba\u00f1a, Jiboa, and La Magdalena). Two families control nearly 70% of the domestic sugar market. The Regalado family owns the Central Izalco mill, and also is the majority shareholder of the Chaparrastique mill. The Wright family owns the El \u00c1ngel mill and is the majority shareholder in the La Magdalena mill.122 CASALCO, which represents companies in the construction and real estate sectors, is another actor with enormous interest in water. According to studies by the Global Water Partnership for Central America, water supply for human consumption (including supply for forecasts suggest that this trend will hold steady.123 According to the Water Forum, real estate expansion, especially the form of luxury residential complexes, large contaminators of water sources: residential developments in the country generally do not plan for wastewater treatment facilities, leaving the waste to be dumped into rivers.124, 12528 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERCertain events in the real estate sector make it easy to see extreme inequality in water access. One such case is the Potable Water System Improvement Project Trust for Southeast Santa Tecla, Southeast Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, Nuevo Cuscatl\u00e1n, Zaragoza, and San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva, Department of La Libertad (FIHIDRO). The trust beneficiaries include Grupo Roble and JOR, S.A., both of whom are CASALCO members. Grupo Roble is the urban development wing of the Poma family conglomerate, one of the wealthiest in the country and in Central America,126 while JOR, S.A. de C.V. is one of the owners of the El Encanto Residential Country Club, a complex of luxury condominiums with swimming pools and golf courses built in the B\u00e1lsamo Range, in the municipality of San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva (an area already facing The whereby ANDA guarantees the water supply for the municipalities of southeastern Santa Tecla, southeastern Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n, Nuevo Cuscatl\u00e1n, Zaragoza, and San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva. However, an investigative journalism report from the area conducted a decade later shows that the municipalities in the B\u00e1lsamo Range are still waiting for their water supply, while the new residential development projects built by the aforementioned companies were connections\" communities also voiced concern over the impacts of real estate development projects on water quality and environmental harm in general. In October 2019, the Local Roundtable for the Northern Zone of the B\u00e1lsamo Range, part of the Water Forum, filed two claims: one against the Paseo El Prado residential project (a Grupo Roble property) for failing to obtain the appropriate environmental permit, and Box 4. Real estate, water, and inequality the second against the treatment plant in the Brisas de Zaragoza-Etapa I project, for severe contamination of the El Jute river (the main water source for many local communities and in which, raw sewage is dumped).129 29 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, member, of the largest bottling companies in the country: Industrias La Constancia, Agua Alpina, Las Perlitas, and Aquapura and Salud. This sector also demonstrates the competition for water use. Industrias La Constancia is one of the main beverage producers in the country134 and a national and regional Coca- Cola products distributor135 and since 2016, the company is of the multinational company Anheuser-Busch, InBev N.V./S.A. impact on water availability Data collected by social movement organizations such as Alianza por la Solidaridad reveal that this company has been extracting water from the Nejapa aquifer since 1999, which has led to great concern because it is a strategic body of water, providing potable water for half of the population of greater San Salvador. It should also be noted that among the main reasons for concern is the authorization granted to Constancia to set up in the area without an adequate analysis of short, medium or long term impacts, and the precedent that it sought this option after the exhaustion of the groundwater flow that supplied its previous plant in Soyapongo.136 Based on all of the above, it is important to underscore that an analysis of the stakeholders in water governance (political parties, business associations, leading figures and national economic elites) reveals the immense economic and political power behind the opposition to a legal framework on water management that does not respond to their interests. While the economic elites of today look quite different from Francisco Robles Rivera's description (2017) of a coffee plantation owners and agroexporters with great political power and control over the armed forces\" as they once were in the XIX and XX century, they are now \"diversified groups under the control of one or more families\" that effectively deploy their powers in defense of The shared interests among the powerful industrial structures help these groups to accomplish their objectives. The fact that there is still no legislation in place to address the verified water crisis in the country is a clear demonstration of this phenomenon at work. Francisco Robles Rivera's statements are consistent with another study by Waxenecker with data from 2011 about Salvadoran big businesses, which examines overlapping members of their boards and management structures. This study identified a sub-network of 175 large companies - legally registered in El Salvador - that make up a \"hegemonic network with shared interests and relationships.\"138 \"This economic structure has strong ties - in a broad sense - to agriculture, as well as the finance sector, industry, trade, and transportation. There are no apparent logic to the business value chains or cluster economies within the network139, but it is characterized by its sub-structures around and underlying sits the first tier of flagship companies, defined by having shared control of Another similar example is that of the Finca El Espino area, a large state-owned forested plot that served as the \"lungs\" for San Salvador. After a series of donations and land concessions, parts of the plot were sold to real estate developers and transformed into shopping malls and residential projects.130, 131 In fact, in the year 2000 the Central American Water Tribunal132 ruled to \"censure the Government of El Salvador and the three branches of the State for unfair and irregular land use management in the El Espino land, and consequentially the inhabitants of the San Salvador Metropolitan Area\", and to \"denounce that the Government of El Salvador had privileged private interests at the expense of the common good...\".13330 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERtheir boards of directors and high connectivity between sub-structures within the hegemonic network itself.141 It is the flagship company in the sugar sector in El Salvador and its board of directors is composed of several key players among CASSA is also part of the Salvadoran Sugar Association, which is part of ASI and ANEP. In line with these relationships, Waxenecker describes how ANEP, FUSADES, with big businesses, which \"enables the representation of their interests and defense of status (Waxenecker, 2017).143 All the above, helps to identify the main economic sectors that are the most sensitive to water governance, the multiple structures where they overlap, and how they function as influencing in the making of tier. ANEP brings together the majority of the businesses and industry groups, and is thus an important actor in the national debate. The interest of these sectors in discussions on water legislation is clear when studying to the Committee on the proposals for the General Water Law. Figure 4. Map of the main business associations or industry groups that represent the economic sectors most to sources.144 31 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 4. THE WATER public policies that work to benefit all citizens\".145 It could also be said that the nature of the political process (in terms of equity, for example) to produce policies, key achieving development equity in the political processes that determine issues such as who has (or does not have) access to essential goods such as water is often On the contrary, it is performed in complex political and social scenarios in which individuals and groups with unequal power interact a of opposing the composition 32 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERof the group of actors participating in the decision-making process has a fundamental bearing on policy selection and implementation, and in consequence, on the impact of these policies on development outcomes.\"146 Certain actors can use their relatively greater power to influence and shape the process and the implementation of policies, norms, and regulations in service of their own interests and agendas, and against those of the majority. This statement fits with the literature defining the phenomenon of political Cort\u00e9s and abusive influence extractive in favor of their own interests and priorities and to the detriment of the general interest - on the cycle of public policies and state agencies (or others regional or international reach), with potential impacts on economic, political, or social inequality, and the functions of democracy.\"147 Nonetheless, the spectrum of possible forms of \"capture\" is broad, from a law to the state apparatus itself. In fact, in the economic history of Latin America and the Caribbean, there have been extreme cases of capture nearly to the level of taking on inequality and general wellbeing.148 In the context of this study, it can be said that for over a decade, discussions in the Legislative Assembly on the General Water Law have been caught between paralysis and the threat of capture through control of the governing body for water resources. This scenario has ended up limiting fair access to quality water for the population, especially for people in the most vulnerable sectors of the country. Thus it is possible to hypothesize what is behind the failure to legislate on this matter is the intention to capture the process on water regulation (and eventually water itself) in the country. That is, the legislative process has been blocked for so long in large part due to the threat that more severe and restrictive water regulation than that which exists now, would pose for the economic elite, and the possibility it won't be the elites that are in a position to decide on water resource management in the country. Although the public information available for this report did not include sufficient data to confirm that there is a process of political capture of water policy in El Salvador, it is at least clear that there is a series of elements that have created (and continue to create) ideal conditions for the capture of this policy. It is important to add that these conditions could the other could facilitate capture, along with the mechanisms to channel the interests of the economic elite in this case, are organized in Box 5 and Figure 5. a. Economic actors sensitive to water governance with strong political influencing capacity due to their resources: Concentrated economic power: There is a group of economic elites characterized by their clear economic power, and the concentration of this power into few hands/families. Strong industry and political linkages: \"Economic and political transformation processes in El Salvador have sort of 'hegemonic economic-political right wing'149 that self- perpetuates, with industry groups functioning as brokers between the economic and political Box 5. Some elements that could facilitate capture of water governance include:33 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERinterests that make up the ecosystem for these elites, in which the State has been an effective instrument for the survival of these groups.\"150 The best example in this case has been the LIA, backed by a large part of the private sector and political parties such as ARENA, PCN, GANA, and PDC. As Waxenecker argues and this report describes, the industry-political ties \"grant a position of social and political power to economic elites, allowing them to access public power (through elections, appointments, and/or the 'revolving door'151), or through direct influence in political decision-making.\"152 b. An enabling environment that may have facilitated blocking legislation: The electoral climate and proximity to the 2019 presidential elections may have contributed to the paralysis. A CMCC chaired by ARENA and the new configuration of the Legislative Assembly in which the balance of power favored right-with parties starting in May 2018 could on legislation, given the Salvadoran economic elites, although clearly no political party has been capable of building the necessary consensus to make definitive passage political party financing, lobbying activities,153 and revolving doors represent ideal ways for elites to make influencing inroads in favor of their interests and agendas. - Political parties in El Salvador are financed through a mix of public and private funds, with few regulations in place in terms of state contributions, and almost no regulations on private donations. Parties can receive unlimited private donations in cash or in kind, with minimal legal limitations.154 There is even less control lobbyists.156 is also no regulation in the country on revolving doors. For example, there are no set timelines (cooling-off periods) that public officials are required to respect before joining professional activities in the private sector - or vice versa - to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.157 There are also no controls on the handling of confidential, privileged, or sensitive information to which public officials may have had access in the course of their roles in public office.158 d. Mechanisms that may have facilitated the capture: Functional cohesion between large segments of the economic and political elites in the country, mediated by industry groups, has materialized and been maintained through specific influencing political (such as think tanks, foundations, and research centers) with capacity to influence the agenda, content, and approaches taken on key issues in the country, that are sensitive to the interests and agendas of elite groups. Without disregarding the influence these organizations hold over parts of public opinion, the mechanism is of of ideas\" : rather than shaping mechanism feeds into a monolithic position or static discourse from the economic and political 34 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSource: Developed internally from a number of sources. Figure elements from the theory water governance capture in El Salvador. Source: Developed internally from a of sources.elites way for discussion among all relevant stakeholders to help break out of the paralysis around the regulatory framework on water. In fact, the public demonstrations of 2018 mentioned earlier are a clear symptom that a large part of the population has its own opinion on the matter of water governance. The historical dynamics of the economic elites in the country in favor of their own interests, the political strength of industry groups, and the lack of regulation on key matters that allow the elites to exert effective influencing power in the political workings of the country, are factors that may have facilitated lobbying of the CMCC by (or on behalf of) the economic elites sensitive to water governance in favor of the LIA.159 35 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 5. UNREGULATED POLITICAL PARTY FINANCING As previously described, there are few on and no limits on campaign expenditures. The relationships between economic and political actors are very close under this model. In effect, private financing (from party or non-party component in Salvadoran While the fact that a sector or group donates to a political party is not - on its own - enough to argue that the party fully submits to the donor's interest, there is no dispute that donations are one of the most important mechanisms that the economic elites use to influence politics.161 In the case of El Salvador, Artiga-Gonz\u00e1lez (2011) argues that \"political financing in general, and political party financing in particular, is a matter of enormous interest for politicians and other public actors in El Salvador. But this interest is not in the sense of establishing or improving regulations on the matter. Politicians' interest lies in their shared needs to meet these individual, party, or institutional interests.\"162 For quite some time, political donations in El Salvador were kept out of the public eye. In recent years, however, greater attention has been paid to the implications of this financing for the construction of a truly democratic governance system. Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, one of the most active Salvadoran civil society organizations in this field, points out that \"the money that parties receive impacts the political dynamics of the country, enabling groups to co-opt state institutions undue elected officials, and political parties. In addition, the lack of controls on political donations and low levels of financial transparency in political parties are favorable conditions for corruption.\"163 The Law for Access to Public Information (LAIP by its Spanish abbreviation) (2012),164 and the Political Party Law (LPP) (2013),165 are legislative efforts to put legal regulations and institutional controls on political parties in the country, but oversight continues to be deficient. In the words of the flow of toward \"bounces between legal and illegal, legitimate and illegitimate, and between what is visible and what is invisible.\" Access to information on the financial dealings of political parties was finally feasible in 2017. This access came after a process that involved Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, the Institute for Access to Public Information (the public institution in charge of the application of the LAIP law, IAIP by its Spanish abbreviation), the Treasury Ministry, Constitutional Court, and the Court.16736 SALVADOR: in politics Two reports from the Transparency and Democracy Monitoring Center [ Centro de Monitoreo de Transparencia y Democracia ] of Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana analyze political party financing in El Salvador. The first report, \"Money, Politics, and Parties: Political financing in 2017\" [ Dinero, pol\u00edtica y partidos. El financiamiento pol\u00edtico en 2017 ] covers a period from 2014 to 2017, while the second report \"Political Financing in 2018: Party transparency and accountability\" [ El financiamiento pol\u00edtico en 2018: transparencia y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas de los partidos ] covers the period from January 2018 to January 2019.168 The 2018 report reveals that there is no oversight by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) of political parties, as the TSE simply receives the financial statements from the parties without performing financial audits of any sort. That is, the authenticity of the information reported is not verified. The two reports examine the amounts each these The resulting information paints a clear picture. Both reports show ARENA as the party receiving the most private donations in El Salvador, although other right-wing parties also receive some contributions from many of the same donors. A look at the ARENA party financing structure offers a view of the sectors that surround the party, and can give some context to its position in support of private sector participation in water governance. According to Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, ARENA reported receiving 26.9 USD private donations from 2014 to 2017, compared to 13.6 million USD reported by the FMLN, and 988,000 and 1.8 million USD reported by GANA and PCN, respectively.169 In other words, in this period ARENA doubled the private donations from its closest rival, the FMLN, and took in 25 times more in donations than the GANA party. In 2018, ARENA received $10.2 million, compared to $1.9 million reported by the FMLN, $229,000 reported by GANA, and $1.9 million for the PCN party. In this year, ARENA raked in almost five times more than the FMLN and 44 times more than GANA.170 Chart 3. Private donations to leading political to 2018 Source: Table developed internally based on \"Dinero, Pol\u00edtica y Partidos. El financiamiento pol\u00edtico en 2018\" and \"El Financiamiento pol\u00edtico en 2018: transparencia y rendici\u00f3n de cuentas de los partidos\" published by the Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana Transparency and Democracy partyPrivate total amount of private donations that flowed into the ARENA party from 2014 to 2017 accounts for 65% of its total financing, with the remaining 35% coming from public funds. In 2018, that first figure held steady at 65%. The amount is not the only important information to help understand the interests behind political financing for each party. It is also important to know who are making the donations. The origin of the funds for the different political parties suggests some initial conclusions: private donations come from individuals as well as companies, and some contributions come from party members in specific geographic areas (undetermined donations). According to the data, there are important distinctions in the type of private donors. In 2018, the FMLN party had the greatest number of total individual donors (2,394), while ARENA had the highest number of donations to fact, business contributions to ARENA accounted for 87% of the total business contributions, and individual donations to the FMLN represented 65% of the total individual contributions for all political parties in the country in 2017.172 According to research done by Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana into ARENA party finances for 2017, some individuals did make small donations to the party (in some cases for insignificant amounts, as low as $1.00 for example), while these same individuals also held high-level positions in companies that made large donations. This was the case for 34 individuals from 30 donor companies in 2017.173 This trend substantiates a previous observation from this report of the presence of a business network in the country with overlapping actors in their leadership structures, which certainly expands their sphere of influence. The reveal a fabric of interests made up of individuals and companies. For example, Juan Carlos Calleja Hakker, the current Vice- President of Grupo Calleja (owner of the largest supermarket chain in El Salvador and presidential candidate under the ARENA party), donated $1,901.00 to the party, while the two companies in which he sits on the board donated a total of $877,735.00.174 Another example is that of Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Poma Delgado, who made a $1.00 donation in 2017, while the three companies on whose boards he sits (Autof\u00e1cil, S.A. de C.V., Distribuidora de Autom\u00f3viles, S.A. de C.V.; and Metrocentro, S.A. de C.V.) donated a total of $722,855.27.175 Calleja S.A. was the largest donor for the ARENA party in 2017, followed by Compa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a, S.A. de C.V., and Metrocentro, S.A. de C.V.176 The four most important individual donors for the party that year were: Juan J. Borja Letona (Grupo Borja Letona), Joaqu\u00edn Alberto Palomo Deneke (who sits on the boards of Grupo CASSA and Inversiones Las Brisas, which also donate to the party), Carlos Roberto Saca Chahin (Grupo Carosa), and Mar\u00eda Florence Gladys Hill de Mathies. Similarly, the top five companies that donated large quantities of money to ARENA in 2018, accounted for 39% of the total private contributions to the party. These companies were: Calleja S.A.; Metrocentro, S.A. de C.V.; Distribuidora de Autom\u00f3viles, S.A. de C.V.; Compa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a S.A. de C.V.; and Autof\u00e1cil, S.A. de C.V.177. The names of the leading individual donors to the ARENA party in 2018 coincide with many of the prominent businessmen from the aforementioned companies: Luis Alfredo Escalante Sol, Antonio Juan Cristiani Burkard, Carlos Enrique Araujo Eserski, Carlos Le\u00f3n Imberton Deneke, Carlos Roberto Saca Chahin, Mar\u00eda Florence Gladys Hill de Mathies, Joaqu\u00edn Alberto Palomo Deneke and Alfredo F\u00e9lix Cristiani 2017 some businesses that funded three right-wing parties: ARENA, PCN, and PDC. In 2017,179 seven companies donated to the three parties with Compa\u00f1\u00eda Azucarera Salvadore\u00f1a S.A. de C.V. making the largest contributions.. The information shows that this company donated a total of $710,000.00: ARENA received $430,000.00, with $200,000.00 for the PCN and $80,000.00 for the PDC.18038 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERIt is also important to note that in addition to donations from individuals and their companies to the three parties at the same time, the data show that board members on companies that donated to a political party also sit on the boards of other companies that donated to the same party. According to data provided by Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana, this dynamic occurs only in the case of the ARENA party, where 74 companies contributing to the party share 84 board members among them. Some of these board members hold positions in up to eight companies at once.181 The chairman of the board on one company may be a director in another company, a deputy board secretary in another, etc.182 The difference compared to the rest of the political parties in El Salvador is dramatic. The largest donor for ARENA in 2017 was Calleja which contributed $871,780.01, compared the largest donation for the FMLN at $16,379.17, contributed by an individual, Santiago Flores Alfaro (himself an FMLN legislator).183, 184 In 2018, the FMLN received $22,868.00 from four companies in the country; Industrias Facela S.A. de C.V. made the largest of these donations, at $11,300.00. The total donations for the FMLN from private hands represented less than 1% of all of the for political parties in that year.185 ARENA's funding scheme in particular allows, and in practice encourages, the creation of a significant radius of influence by funders, where an intricate business concentrates Economic sectors and funding for Salvadoran political parties In 2018, the main sector that made political contributions in El Salvador was commerce ($5,183,196.10), followed by real estate ($2,102,360.00) and agro-industrial companies in third place at $1,819,620.52.186 The construction sector follows close behind, in fifth place.187 The combined contributions from real estate, agroindustry, and construction companies accounted for 32% of the total donations that year.188 Further, an analysis of the subsectors reveals that out of 81 specified sectors, real estate (companies dedicated to purchase, sale, and rental of properties and provision of other real estate services), sugarcane, and construction companies represented the first, fourth, and sixth positions, respectively, were among the subsectors making the greatest political in 2018; nearly 3 of every 10 dollars donated came from these subsectors.189 This is consistent with the position of Grupo CASSA as the leading donor for the ARENA, PDC, and PCN parties in 2017. The real estate parties. For example, the Due\u00f1as Hermanos LTDA company, an ARENA and PCN donor, works in the construction sector and has ties with Desarrollos Inmobiliarios Urb\u00e1nica (the construction company for the Portal del Casco Norte, Puerta La Castellana and Puerta Los Faros urban development projects in the former El Espino plot, and in the La Gran V\u00eda mall).190 The construction sector also includes Metrocentro, S.A. de C.V., which is the third largest donor for the ARENA party. Metrocentro, part of Grupo Roble,191 belongs to the previously mentioned business conglomerate, Grupo Poma. The sugarcane, real estate, and construction industries belong to the sectors with the greatest economic muscle in El Salvador. These are also the industries for whom water access is essential. In this regard, it is reasonable to conclude that they have a particular interest in ensuring a private sector presence in any governing body created by water legislation. Three of the main private donors to political parties also hail from these industries, as demonstrated by the Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana data. Under this scenario, what is certainly questionable are the implications of political representativeness of the parties with respect to the interests and needs of their voters, and thus on democracy itself. Eduardo Escobar, 39 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERExecutive Director of Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana shared that the \"largest donors to parties have a particular interest in making that donation, and in this case, it is to receive at least one benefit from the official financed, or that official does not interfere to their interests. It cannot be ignored, for example, that there may be tensions even within sectors that donate to one or these with time and context. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to state that the political party donation system in place in El Salvador helps to blur the limits between the interests of large economic groups and those of the parties to which they contribute. Without a doubt, this is an enabling environment for the capture of institutions and democratic spaces. Through the party financing system, a network of family groups and companies with enormous resources can easily exacerbate the existing SALVADOR: AND POWERSECTION 6. CAPTURE OF IDEAS AND STATIC DISCOURSE The central idea in the debate around the water governing body in El Salvador has to do with the concept of water resources as primarily a market product, pitted against the assertion of water as a human right or a \"public good\", which would require the State to take around water governance are also expressed in theoretical discourse waged among think tanks and academics. The actors who view water as a principally commercial resource are supported by a series of organizations, think tanks, and different associations that argue this vision in events, conferences, and publications supported by local, regional, and global traditional and social media. On a national level, FUSADES and the Salvadoran Business Council for Sustainable Development ( Consejo Empresarial Salvadore\u00f1o para el Desarrollo Sostenible, CEDES) are two such institutions that frequently articulate this view in international networks. CEDES is a local chapter of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and FUSADES is part of at least 23 networks that \"promote policy in committed to progress and wellbeing for all Salvadorans\", and it is perhaps the most influential political think tank in El Salvador. According to a ranking published on its webpage, FUSADES held the 27th position among think tanks in Latin America, and the first spot in Central America in 2014. FUSADES was once again ranked first in the nation in 2018 along with Fundaungo on the University of Pennsylvania Global Go To Think Tank Index and tends to represent their interests in public policy has defended private sector representation in water governance,196 and its board of directors is composed of ARENA party members from the main economic sectors of the country.197 For example, in an article published on the FUSADES webpage in 2015, one of the FUSADES board members from that period raised a series of critiques of the legislation proposed in 2012, highlighting institutional weakness that resulted from - in his judgement - low private sector participation.198 A report published by Contrapunto in April 2013 also detailed the FUSADES position in favor of private sector in the governing body.199 in El Salvador: importance, management, and participation\" [ Recursos h\u00eddricos en El Salvador, importancia, gesti\u00f3n 41 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERy participaci\u00f3n ],200 which focuses on the concept of participation, calling for inclusion of the State, society, and productive sectors in the governing body. For its part, CEDES' objective is to \"lead on matters of corporate sustainability with the business community and promote the concept as a core component of corporate strategy, with participation from government board of directors includes representatives from companies such as Holcim El Salvador, Pettenati Centroam\u00e9rica, Banco Davivienda, Agrisal Inmobiliario, Unilever, Hanes Brands, Grupo has resource management.\"202 Since 2000, ANEP has organized the National Gathering of Private Enterprise (ENADE), an annual event that produces position documents on has held a prominent position in ENADE publications. The proposed Law for Comprehensive Water Management introduced by the irrigation agriculture sector203 was the subject of the conference in 2014, giving the private sector a privileged position to influence in decision-making. This scenario fits with \"elephant the room\" strategy, to the idea that privileged actors populate strategic spaces for debate with such an overwhelming presence - acting as an omni- present block - which often condemns any other voices to the margins. The Global Water Forum held in 2012 is one example of this strategy. The cost to get in the door at this event was 350 euros for people from developing countries and 700 euros for participants from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. For the majority of the Salvadoran population, the cost event represented times their monthly income -- it is difficult to imagine interests of grassroots organizations members represented at the event and their concerns did not make it on the agenda. Zepeda goes one step further by documenting interviews with members of the community of San Jos\u00e9 Villanueva, one of the areas affected by water shortages. Zepeda indicates that not complain, about absence from this forum because they are entirely unaware of the spaces that they should \"occupy\" to influence the debate on water in their country, or even the possibility of their doing content of public interest discussions has to do with the way that these groups promote their interests by taking actors thus look to safeguard their interests and push for space on the governing body for water administration by arguing that this body should be open to \"participation\" from the private sector. As seen above, FUSADES referenced the concept of participation to support the inclusion of the private sector on the governing body. While recognizing the importance of hearing private sector voices on such a key issue for their economic activities, the problem is that there are certain forms of participation on the governing body that to serious conflicts of interest and significant imbalances in its favor, to exert power over water access and use.42 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERSECTION 7. UNREGULATED LOBBYING This same research has faced the the lack of effective regulations on lobbying activities in the country. It has been nearly impossible to obtain detailed information on the dynamics and interactions between different stakeholders in the conflict around water regulations in the Legislative Assembly. While ethical and transparent lobbying activities can benefit policy development and democracy, it also true that without effective regulation, lobbying can also pose a threat when these lack transparency. The lack of transparency is less than ideal on its own, but it also \"opens door to illicit to specific private over collective good, or use of state institutions in function of these private interests.\"205 represented, is representing them, or which officials are being lobbied.\"206 In March 2019, Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana requested information on the meeting agendas and schedules for the representatives in the Legislative Assembly. This information request asked for the topic and goal of the meetings held, the sectors that participated, who facilitated the other information. In addition, Acci\u00f3n presented amendment to the LAIP to information.207 was forcing litigation with IAIP to try to obtain the data. IAIP ruled that information on meeting agendas audiences granted and held with legislators at the Legislative Assembly made available citizens.\"208 IAIP instructed the Legislative Assembly to pass regulations to this end. At that time, however, only one legislator - Leonardo Bonilla, the first legislator with no party affiliation in the Legislative Assembly in El Salvador - handed over the requested information, even only partially.209 The Legislative Assembly filed an appeal with Court revert IAIP ruling, arguing that it was illegal. The Administrative Dispute Court has yet to rule on this appeal.210 The lack of regulation on these matters is another factor that may influence the style and substance of the debates on water governance in the country. This situation underscores the enormous resources sectors the different Legislative Assembly. Greater reveal clearer evidence of the role that lobbying plays in the debate on water legislation.43 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER SECTION 8. CONCLUDING REMARKSThe water crisis in El Salvador, associated in large part with the lack of regulation for water resources, is a national problem that does not affect everyone equally. Women, people living in rural areas or poor urban settlements, and people living in poverty face the most severe consequences.44 EL SALVADOR: WATER, POWERDespite an important citizen movement demanding the adoption of a General Water Law that could fill many of these legal gaps, discussions in the Legislative Assembly have stagnated for over a decade. The economic sectors that are in large part responsible for the water crisis in the country, and who demonstrate ties to and influence over the political dynamics, could be playing an important role to block legislation such also appear to be unwilling to allow the establishment of a governing body configured in accordance with the UCA proposal. If legislation is passed, the interests of these powerful actors would appear to be better represented in the LIA. There is an enabling environment for these sectors with their undeniable power to exert excessive influence in the political debate on water governance. Their close ties with industry groups and political parties pose a serious threat to equity in the policy-making process for issues of interest. Given the lack or failure of effective regulation and control measures, this powerful economic and political block allows the interests and agendas of the economic elites to easily and substantially influence the dynamics of institutional configuration in the country (that is, the legal and regulatory frameworks and their implementing structures in the country). The essential thesis of this study is that beyond the ideological and historical aspects that foundations, or research centers) with the capacity to influence both the agenda and the contents and approaches to issues discussed in the country that are sensitive to the interests and agendas of the elite. These organizations build a position (static stakeholders in the conflict around the water law, producing a version of what is referred to as \"capture of ideas\" . The lack of information on lobbying activities raises reasonable doubts about the use of this mechanism to ensure that the elites sensitive to water governance has had more space to advocate with the Legislative Assembly. From a political equity standpoint, (elites) perspectives interests of any other actor, regardless of the issue or negotiations. Given the power and resources held by parts of the economic elite - the group most sensitive to water governance issues - and the functional cohesion of these economic groups with the political elites, the imbalance in their favor configures a structural advantage in policy or regulatory debates. This imbalance is the ideal breeding ground for economic and social inequality to reproduce. That is, this advantage has the potential to act in detriment and at a disadvantage to opposing actors to the interests of the economic elite, or an elite group that aligns with the political elite. In addition to describing the conflict around inequality in water access, this report seeks to offer recommendations to level the playing field for political negotiation, and thus to facilitate the adoption of a regulatory framework that can ensure respect for the human right to water for all Salvadorans.45 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWER SECTION 9. RECOMMENDATIONS: HOW TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR POLITICAL NEGOTIATION? Reduciendo v\u00edas espec\u00edficas por donde pueda producirse una influencia desmedida de grupos de poder en pro de sus intereses211: a. Political funding (for parties, candidates, and campaigns): Pass the political party finance reforms introduced in the Legislative Assembly to create the Political Oversight Office, increase or establish new penalties for non-compliance of transparency and funding, and improve accountability. Reform the Law on Political Parties to set limits on private donations for political parties and candidates, in terms of total volume as well as limits on individual donations. Pass the reform to limits campaign to consider campaigning on the Internet and social media. 46 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERb. Lobbying: Discuss, draft, the existence of formal in which all individuals and organizations can submit proposals and state their interests in relevant debates. In this regard, it is important that participation is not left up to the discretion of the public officials to determine who participates, and the procedures and formats for their participation. c. Revolving doors: Regulate public officials as they take office, change positions, and leave office. Set \"cooling-off\" periods before and after holding public office in the case of ties to the private sector. Enact strict codes of regulate the cases. Ensure existence of independent teams to advise on public policy decisions. the or empower different forms citizens' public affairs, through the adoption of policies or passage of legislation for citizen participation public administration. This should include the possibility for citizens to introduce legislation and for citizen consultation at different stages of the policy-making process. Guarantee a Promote or support democratization of the media and state support for community 47 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND able and teaching practice to and citizen interests. delay a rights-based approach and gender lens Promote the development of a national agreement to advance toward the passage of legislation that respects and upholds people's current and future rights to water access without discrimination. This of course includes taking every natural for climate change adaptation to mitigate negative impacts on water availability. The state should play a leading role in water management under this law, and participation mechanisms should ensure equity of the sectors affected by the water crisis in the country. The contents of the law should be designed with a gender lens. That is, the law should explicitly recognize how the lack of assurances for continued to quality water for human consumption will disproportionately affect women given their social assigned roles and care work for their households. Matters such as service provision, rates, and general procedures for water access should thus be designed with an eye toward this reality, reduce or minimize the gender inequality stemming from unequal access also includes the design of institutional structures for women's voices and interests. Recognize the right to water in the Constitution of the Republic, and establish the duty to produce a regulatory framework and national policy for water management and protection. 48 EL SALVADOR: WATER, ELITES, AND POWERNOTES 1 See details on the National Administration for Aqueducts and Sewers (ANDA) (2017) Plan Nacional de Agua Potable y Saneamiento de El Salvador .
