In the last few years, as well, the number of bacteria resistant to current antibiotics has along used medicinally for generations [[11]](#b11). Blueberry leaves may be considered one the richest and most readily available sources of green Blueberries (Vaccinium sp.) are rich in clearance [[15]](#b15). of the Canadian low bush blueberry V. angustifolium fruit, leaf and stem was studied by Martineau et (V. corymbosum L.) leaf infusions [[16]](#b16). The aim of the present study was to examine the antioxidant and antibacterialactivity of extracts of the V. corimbosum leaf. Little to no information exists currently in scientific literature on the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of hydroalcoholic leaf extract Missouri, USA). Sodium hydroxide and ferric chloride were obtained from Wako The and superoxide dismutase assay kit was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The pBR322 DNA and 6X DNA loading dye were purchased from Fermentas Inc. (Cromwell Park, Glen Burnie, USA). Agarose A was purchased from Bio Basic Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Roswell Park WElGENE Korea). All the other solvents and chemicals used were of analytical grade. 2.2. Plant material collection and extraction V. corymbosum leaves were collected from Blueberry Suite, Chae-Hyang-Won, of Abirami et with [[17]](#b17). About 100 g grinded powder was extracted with 500 mL of 75% (v/v) ethanol at room temperature for 24 h. Then the extracts were filtered through Whatman filter paper (GE Healthcare extracts evaporated under 10 mg of each extract was dissolved in 1 mL of distilled water different concentrations of gallic acid (0.007 8-1.000 0 mg/mL) were prepared water. total of 40 \u00b5L each sample, 20 \u00b5L (20%, w/v) mixed. Mixtures were kept in dark at room temperature for 30 min to complete the reaction. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was read at 700 nm. Gallic acid was used to calculate the standard curve and the results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of dry weight (mg \u00b5L of each sample reagent was mixed with 125 \u00b5L of distilled water and then 8 \u00b5L of 5% sodium nitrate solution was added. After 5 min incubation 15 \u00b5L of 10% (w/v) aluminum chloride solution was mixed with the above mixture and mixture was incubated at room temperature for 6 min. After 50 \u00b5L of NaOH (0.1 mol/L) and 27 \u00b5L of distilled water were added with the mixture, The intensity of pink colour was measured at 517 nm.

The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 517 nm with a spectrophotometer (Sunrise-Basic Tecan, Austria). Controls were prepared in a similar way as for the test group except for the replacement of the test sample with the corresponding [[21]](#b21) some modifications. The ABTS+ radical was generated by reaction of 5 mL of 2,2-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, 7 mmol/L) in water, potassium persulphate (2.45 mmol/L). The mixture was left to stand for 12-16 h in the dark at room temperature. Absorbance of the reactant was later adjusted to 0.70\u00b10.02, at a wave length of 734 nm. Different concentrations of leaf extracts were mixed with 0.7 mL of ABTS+ solution and the mixture was shaken for 5 min. The reduction of the ABTS+ radical was determinate by reading the absorbance at 734 nm. The controls contained the extraction solvent instead of the test sample. various concentrations, from 0.125-2.000 was mixed with 1 mL of 1 mmol/L NaNO2. Then 8 mL of 0.2 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 3) was added to the mixture and incubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 1 h. After incubation, 1 mL of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and added to a mixture of 2 mL (2% (v/v)) acetic acid and 0.4 mL of Griess reagent. Solution was vigorously mixed with a vortex at room temperature for 15 min.The absorbance was measured at 520 nm. The control contained water instead of the antioxidant solution. Ascorbic acid was used as FeCl2 for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by adding 200 \u00b5L of 5 mmol/L ferrozine and left standing for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance of the mixture was recorded at 562 nm against the blank performed in the same way using FeCl2 and water. EDTA (100 \u00b5g/mL) served as the positive control, and a sample without extract or EDTA served as the negative according [[24]](#b24) Reaction was containing 2.5 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate (pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of K3Fe(CN)6 (10 mg/mL) by incubating at 50\u00b0C for 20 min. After addition of 2.5 mL trichloroacetic acid (100 mg/mL), the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 r/min for 10 min. Then 0.25 mL of supernatant was mixed with 0.25 mL of distilled water and finally 0.5 mL of FeCl3 (0.1% (w/v)) was added with the mixture. (w/v) brain tissuehomogenate which was centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 10 min. Malondialdehyde (MDA) (0.1 of the supernatant was incubated with the different concentrations of the sample mg/mL; 0.2 mL) inthe presence of FeSO4 (10 \u00b5mol/L; 0.1 mL) and ascorbic acid (0.1 mmol/L; 0.1 mL) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic 0.38 mL), and the mixturewas then heated at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 3000 r/min for 10 min the precipitated protein was removed.The colour intensity of the MDA-TBA complex in the supernatant was measured at 532 nm. inhibition cells 6 well plates with DMEM. After 24 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2, the medium was removed fromthe dish leaving cells on the media containing different concentrations of the freeze-dried extracts were added to the dish. After 24 h incubation, 1 mL of ice cold lysis buffer (containing 50 mmol/LTris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 10 mmol/L EDTA) was added and cells were collected. The cell pellet was homogenised for centrifuged at 12 000 r/min for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was collected and damage activity was performed 3 FeSO4 (0.5-2.0 mg/mL). The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Then 2 \u00b5L of DNA loading dye (6X) were added with the mixture. The DNA on usingethidium bromide (Nextep, Korea) and bands quantified (Seoul, South Korea). Microorganisms were cultured at 37 onto the agar after ithad solidified. Paper disc of 8 mm diameter were placed on it, and the extract was added (50 \u00b5L) and the same volume (50 \u00b5L) of ethanol was used as a negativecontrol. positive controls. The inoculated plates were incubatedfor 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation the diameters (mm) of the inhibition zone weremeasured. 2.14. Statistical analysis Experiments were performed in triplicate and the results wereexpressed as mean\u00b1SD. The statistical analysis was carried out by using SPSS 15.0, Sigma plot 10.0, GraphPad Prism 5 and Microsoft Excel 2007. A value of P<0.05 was considered to indicate are as mg GAE/100 g dry weight and mg CE/100 g of respectively. The are shown in [Table g for leaf. Table g and standard (ascorbic acid) on the extracts was 0.12 high level which is significantly different that of ascorbic the test solution changes to various shades of green and blue, depending on the reducing power of the samples. The reducing power of leaf extract, ascorbic acid increased with the increase reducing power of the leaf extract increased from 0.12 to 0.92 at 0.125 to 2.000 mg/mL. However, the reducing power of leaf extract was lower that of ascorbic acid and BHT (P<0.05). The reducing power of the control, BHT and ascorbic acid of TBARS formation provides sound evidence reduce mg/mL, leaf extract and ascorbic acid inhibit 59.55 activities and control at the indicated concentration (250 \u00b5g/mL). One unit for SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. One unit for GPx activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme 1.0 nmol units of protein \u00b1SE (n = 3). * Significantly different from control, P<0.05. 3.7. Oxidative DNA damage preventive activity In this radical DNA 1.0 2.0 form in the absence of Fe2+ H2O2 the the presence of the extracts. At the concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and dense supercoiled activity corymbosum of bacteria. Potency was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by the presence of inhibition zones and zone diameters. Results showed that all the tested bacteria are sensitive to leaf extract. Among the bacteria strains tested, at 5 mg/disc 16.67, 11.49, A. pneumonia, of because high compared to other fruit crops [[28]](#b28). In contrast, the leaves of the plant blueberry have not been given attention. The present study investigated antioxidant antioxidant activity of free In this study, the ability to scavenge the radical ABTS+ has been ascorbic acid. A gradual both leafy and root vegetables; they can produce nitrosamine and are for against the NO3- radical. Free or poorly may be the ions extracts et al herbs is associated with their reducing power, which terminates free radical chain reactions [[36]](#b36). The reducing power of a compound may significant indicator of its potential antioxidant activity [[37]](#b37). In the present study, the reducing of the V. corymbosum leaf extract was evaluated measuring the between compound the reducing the extract. Inhibition of TBARS was peroxidation, brain homogenate discussed above, the leaf extract was an the detoxification of have been be tested extract for 24 h resulted in a elevation of cellular SOD, CAT and GPx content. Yoo et al [[45]](#b45) that at a of 100 \u00b5g/mL lemon verbena and green tea tested extract (at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/mL) was able to protect plasmid DNA against singlet Ramos et al Salvia fruticosa and Salvia officinalis aqueous extracts protected from DNA damage and increased the rate in cultured reaction determining zone of inhibition against two gram-positive and five gram-negative bacteria using skins showing inhibitory effects on the growing of aureus, faecalis, E.
