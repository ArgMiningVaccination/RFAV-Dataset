This a deaths which originates from hepatocytes, predominant type of cells in the liver. The etiology of HCC is principally associated with hepatitis B and C infection. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice but is suitable for only a small fraction of combination has shown modest efficacy with severe the widely used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) alone or in combination with other herbal ingredients. In fact, toad venom is exact reported by be a promising agent for the treatment of HCC. Materials and methods Reagents Dox was purchased Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Antibodies used was by Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). PI3K activator was purchased (Dallas, TX). Atg5, 1 and mTOR siRNA kits cocktail tablets were Applied eosin staining kit was purchased from Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO). Extraction and isolation of The successive mixtures of 1:1) (fraction 1-15). Fraction 6 by (School of Biomedical Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong) and Li-Wu Fu (Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University), respectively. All cell of 5% CO 2 . Dox (1.2 M) was added to the culture medium to maintain concentrations of arenobufagin and incubated for another 24h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being incubated in fresh medium and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C for 10 days. Visible colonies were manually counted at 24h, were fixed in ice-cold 4% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4\u00b0C overnight. in embedded Autophagy detection kit (Enzo Life Sciences) was according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 10min at 10\u00b0C and washed three times with After with 5% bovine serum albumin room temperature. Samples were washed with PBS for three times and examined under confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) with manufacturer's protocol. After 6h incubation, the transfected cells were exposed to arenobufagin for various time points, followed by analysis of by assay, of Transfection weeks old) were obtained from SJA Lab Animal (Hunan, China). The mice were fed with sterilized food and water and were housed in barrier environment with a light-dark cycle of 12 All animal research procedures conducted conformed to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals published by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the laboratory animals care and use committee of Jinan University. HepG2/ADM cells (1\u00d710 7 allowed to grow for ~7 days of ~50mm 3 . Mice were randomly divided into three groups with six mice in each group. One of the groups was administered a daily intraperitoneal dose of 0.1% dimethylsulfoxide in PBS to serve as the vehicle control. The other two groups were administered daily with a low dosage of observed, and their body weights were measured every 3 days throughout the treatment period. Tumor volumes were measured every 3 days and calculated using the following formula: a2 \u00d7 a refers to the smaller diameter and b is the diameter perpendicular to a . The mice were killed at the end of the experiments. Tumor xenografts were removed and weighed. Part of each tumor tissue was stored 80\u00b0C western tumor specimens were embedded paraffin cut into 5 m sections. tissue All experiments were performed at least three times, and data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error. GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used for statistical analysis. A difference considered significant when P < 0.05. Results Arenobufagin inhibits growth of human tumor cells The cell 72h treatment, respectively. and activity arenobufagin. Of note, multidrug-resistant HepG2 sensitive with arenobufagin, autophagosomes and lysosomes Treatment with by the pretreatment of the cells with interrogated using both pharmacological different points the autophagic pathway and assessing the induction of and caspase-9 cell degrees of phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 and Thr 308 and its upstream regulator PDK1 at Ser 241 and inhibit with employed the inhibitor LY294002 or siRNA to silence Akt. then impact on cell of important of Arenobufagin decrease in TORC2, which the Rictor-mTOR complex arenobufagin-treated HCC cells. compared with arenobufagin alone. is increased in 6mg/kg/day in mice with HepG2/ADM xenografts for 28 d, the tumor volume tumors were obviously lower any abnormality in food intake or behavior. and of of venom, treat liver [26](javascript:;) ), we speculated that arenobufagin may be one of the central active ingredients of toad venom for the treatment of liver cancer. In this study, we demonstrated that arenobufagin markedly inhibited the proliferation of a wide of tumor cells including HCC cells. Arenobufagin was effective against any for liver cancer treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the antineoplastic activity of arenobufagin a representative bufadienolide, inhibits the growth of a wide variety of cancer cells through induction of apoptosis and differentiation ( factor receptor HepG2/ADM cells was much lower than that of HepG2 cells suggesting the anticancer as an is by apoptosis in between and apoptosis is made especially complicated by treatment alone. It has been reported that phosphorylation of Akt at Thr and cell shape, whereas Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in HepG2 cells was more and happened earlier than that of HepG2/ADM cells at the same concentration, whereas the decrease in Akt Ser308 phosphorylation was not in cell that the apoptotic rate was higher in HepG2 cells, it can be concluded that phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 may account are three types of autophagy: (i) basal housekeeping autophagy, which is important ( [38](javascript:;) ). Scott et al. (49) found that cells with high levels of Atg1-induced autophagy are may as apoptosis partners to induce cell death. Our results first demonstrated that mTOR might act as an important governing cross between apoptosis is to a prognosis and has a critical role in the pathogenesis of The and autophagy on several HCC suggesting that the has effects HCC cells. Moreover, the appearance which protected cells from apoptotic cell death were both enhanced after the inhibition of mTOR, it should be pointed out that this pathway has a controversial role in HCC treatment. It were changed after arenobufagin treatment. might affects upstream effects of arenobufagin are is no doubt that the antineoplastic mechanisms of arenobufagin are complex. The on molecular mechanisms underlying many changed proteins effect of toad venom on HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo . We elucidated the underlying mechanism involves of arenobufagin to be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for found Foundation of China (90913020, 30901847, 81025021 and 90713036); Science and Technology Program Guangzhou City (2011J2200045 and 2011Y1-00017); Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT0965) and the 973 Program grant (2009CB825506).
