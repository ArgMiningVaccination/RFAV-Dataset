This provocative statement uttered by troublemaker Price, a young boy attending the history class taught by the narrator Tom Crick in Graham Swift's 1983 novel Waterland, not only launches the story of Tom's personal life as it intertwines with the collective history of his homeland, the Fens, in Eastern England. It also metafictionally by now well-known postmodern theories of critics such as Fredric Jameson and Baudrillard, who equate the postmodern condition with the loss of historical consciousness and the fictionality of history. Within that perspective, the Second World War and the Holocaust, by embodying the limits of representation, come to be seen as the arch temporal marker or historical divider that led to the end of history or, as Dominick LaCapra puts it in Representing the Holocaust, of rupture between modernism and postmodernism\" (LaCapra 1994, 188). For him, one is now forever \"caught between an illusory attempt at theoretical or fragmentation\" (LaCapra 1994, 194). 2These interrogations lie at the heart of three literary and cinematic works that were all released in the 1980s: Italian director Ettore Scola's 1983 silent Le Bal (Ballando... Ballando), contemporary British novelist Anita Brookner's 1985 novel Family and Friends, and British filmmaker Terence Davies's 1988 film Distant Voices, Still Lives. What is striking in these three works, despite their different textual and visual nature, is not so much their similar narrative techniques, with their use of photographs and stilled images as well as songs and dances, but the way in which they explore the cyclicality or \"dance\" of history in terms that with the postmodern concepts of trauma poststructuralist theorists of the photograph, this essay will show how, in these three works which explore the notions of temporality, memory, and nostalgia, the photographs, which are used as both narrative device and historical evidence, represent far more than just an attempt at fixating and containing the passing of time. By chronicling the second half of a twentieth century marked by the epistemological rupture of the Second World War\u2014present in all three works\u2014and the Holocaust\u2014barely alluded to, and yet omnipresent, in Brookner's novel\u2014they provide a view of history which, from then on, can only be apprehended as an endless and meaningless cyclical return, characters, cohesion an original narrative strategy at the frontier between the two semiotic codes of text and image, Anita Brookner's Family and Friends presents itself in the form of a fictitious family photo-album spanning three successive generations over the course of the twentieth century. The novel starts and ends with a narrator opening, browsing through, and then closing a wedding-photograph album, which enables him or her to chronicle the saga of the Dorns, a family of Jewish exiles who fled the Nazi regime in Germany to find shelter in London, and then in Italy and California for two of its members. photograph is presented through look at pictures rather than read words\u2014although these pictures never materialize and have a purely textual existence\u2014the reader is encouraged to suspend his or her disbelief and welcome this hybrid literary object as a photo album and not a novel: \"Here's Sofka, in a wedding photograph\", reads the first sentence in the novel (FF 7), \"Here they are all, family and friends, in the wedding photograph\", reads the first sentence of the very last paragraph (FF 187). The visual journey through the photo-album is carried out by claim to have, or have had, special links with the family presented in the album. The four wedding photographs\u2014all of which staged around the figure of the punctuate and the narrative flow before releasing it again constitute, as it were, the temporal and structural pillars on which the narrative stands. 5The of Sofka Dorn, surrounded by her four children, Mimi, Betty, Frederick and Alfred. After a first chapter mainly dedicated to the description of this inaugural photograph, the central character of the mother, Sofka, and the festivities of the day, the narration takes up again, one by one, the main characters of the photo and follows their respective destinies from childhood to middle through as \"zooming\" or from of the first photograph to the close-up shot of one particular character, accompanied each time by a change in the point of view. Out of a concern for realism, since the reader is supposed to be leafing through a photo-album spanning some thirty or forty years, each new chapter portrays each new character at a period in his or her life which is different from the one chosen for his or her other brothers and sisters. This device contributes to a large extent to the striking temporal and linear fluidity of the novel, in spite the that the general structure implies. Indeed, the thematic series of the four wedding photographs in chapters one, six, ten, and fourteen provides temporal continuity, while the narrative itself, through the description that is of each photograph, gives substance of existence in a twofold manner. On the one hand, it animates it within its own frame, by describing and giving life to the contents of the image, and on the other hand it \"expands\" it, or rather \"stretches\" it, beyond the limits of its frame, into a space which is outside the picture, that is to say invisible to the viewer. Thus, in Family and Friends, the characters, fixed in the conventional pose of the wedding photograph with which the novel opens, become animated at first, as soon as the picture is taken, and then disperse, all the better to gather again according to their age or function (while remaining within the limits of the frame of the initial picture): I have no doubt that once the photograph was taken, and the wedding group dispersed, the festivities took their normal course. I have that quantities of sugar\u2014were consumed, and that the music struck up and the bride and bridegroom danced, oblivious of their guests, and that the elders gathered in groups on their gilt chairs while the children, flushed with too many sweet meals and the lure of polished continues, this time going beyond the spatio-temporal frame of the image it has animated, by focusing on a detail of the picture, the specific character of the mother, Sofka, and transporting it into another narrative space and another narrative time, which constitute what we can call the \"narrative off-screen space\" of the inaugural picture. A flashback thus takes us back to the morning before the wedding, when Sofka, surrounded by her children in one of the rooms in her house precisely called the \"morning-room\", is waiting for the car that will drive them to the place of the festivities: \"Sofka sits in her morning-room, waiting for the car to come round\" (FF 16). A few lines further down, after a short description of the scene preceding the arrival of the car, followed by a brief return to the banquet, the narration again prolongs the initial image beyond its frame by once again \"removing\" Sofka and showing her at home still, but this time on the day following the wedding: \"Reflecting, on the a success\" (FF 17-18). 7However\u2014and this is part of the charm of this novel with its accordion-like structure\u2014in both cases (the morning before, and the day after, the wedding), no sooner has the narration gone beyond the limits of its original frame than it becomes contained again within another frame. Indeed, in the first case, on the morning preceding the wedding, the description of Sofka and her children sitting around her echoes the initial wedding picture, and the metaphorical picture that they compose presents remarkable analogies with the opening of the novel (that is to say, the first photograph in the album). Although Sofka is no longer standing but sitting, we can notice the same hieratic pose (\"Sofka stands straight same \"beaded dress\", the same hat, and the same presence of her two daughters, no longer behind her as before (\"Behind her stand her two daughters\", FF 7) but this time around her (\"Around her sit the girls\", FF 16). Moreover, the fixed, effect of reinforced by two two artistic domains, painting, with the \"Pre-Raphaelite dresses\" of the young women, and sculpture, with Frederick's pose which is reminiscent of Leochares' Apollo Belvedere, as well as by the presence of a double frame, the doorframe where Frederick is standing, representing a frame-within-the-frame: \"Lounging in the doorway, with the nonchalant stance of the Apollo Belvedere, is Frederick who enjoys these long celebrations [...]\" (FF 17). describes the as o [(...)](#ftn1) 8This very is surprisingly similar to those \"conversation pieces\" in the manner of Hogarth, for instance, in which the interest of the painting lies in the fact that the characters who are depicted are not presented as specifically posing. [1](#ftn1) Instead, they are shown at home, pottering around or chatting over tea, for example. In our case, the scene takes place in the drawing-room where the characters are depicted waiting for the car that will take them to the wedding, with the eldest son, Frederick, obligingly pouring a glass of Madeira to his mother: \"Even now he is pouring his mother a tiny glass of Madeira, placing a small table at her elbow, smiling at her, and very gently teasing her, for she finds these events initially daunting\" (FF 17). In the second case, on the day following the wedding, the narration also becomes contained again within a frame, with Sofka apprehending her day as a \"perfect picture\", and the pictorial or photographic metaphor, initially used in the first family of the photofiction\u2014can now function fully: \"Looking out into the garden, she sees that a wheelbarrow has not been put away. She frowns slightly. How tiresome that so innocent a detail should the perfect movement of scenes\" freeze time and space thus come to duplicate, at the level of the micro-structure, the formal wedding photographs of the macro-structure through a kind of metonymic shift. This is the case, for instance, of the scene of the Sunday dinner in chapter six, with the roast beef being cut by Alfred, in which the choice of the signifier \"picture\" in the narratorial injunction pictorial aspect scene, turning terminology knives, to large roast of beef, for Sunday is devoted to the consumption of traditional English food [...] Alfred sits at the head of the table because Sofka has decided that he deserves this distinction. She herself sits at the foot, and Frederick is on her right, where he prefers to be. (FF 77) 10This process the that the characters exchange in the text, such as the pictures of his children that Frederick sends to his mother from his place of exile in Italy in chapter eleven, or the photographs of Mimi's wedding in chapter ten, which duplicate the ones that constitute the backbone of the novel. We have therefore a veritable mise en abyme of the narration, in which the description of the image is no longer mediated only by the gaze of the narrator, but also by the focal consciousness of a character who is inside the story, in this case Betty, in exile in the US. Here too, as for the wedding photographs of the macro-structure, the contemplation of the image generates its description by the focalizer, a description which is accompanied, as in chapter one, by a reflection which extends beyond the frame of the image: \"But when the wedding photographs arrive and she astonishingly prosperous Mimi looks in her white dress and with all those flowers, Betty turns thoughtful. She reflects that Mimi seems narrative technique Anita novel Family and Friends, with the inclusion of photographs and fixed frames at the level of both the macro-structure and the micro-structure, recalls the one used by Italian director Ettore Scola in his 1983 motion picture Le Bal (Ballando... Ballando) which, in order to relate fifty years of French history from the Popular Front in 1936 to the early 1980s, stages couples dancing on the dance-floor of a single ballroom to the sound and rhythm of each different period. In this \"silent\" film\u2014that is to say without dialogues or an identifiable narrator, but with popular music throughout\u2014the the the dance-floor, and the idylls and dramas that result from these pairings. At the end of each significant period of time, on four different occasions in the film (the German Occupation, the Liberation, the 1950s, and the 1960s), the narration comes to a stop when a camera, invisible since located outside the picture, but still noticeable from its loud photographic equivalent the into a black and white photograph which, endowed with a proper frame, comes to hang imposingly on the wall behind the bar of the ballroom, where it represents a veritable mise en abyme of the narration, which can then resume. In this film as in Brookner's novel, the photographs play the part of fixed frames that contain and freeze both the narration and history, while precisely rendering their ineluctable flow. And as in the novel, these macro-structural frames are also duplicated by smaller frames in the form of the large mirrors that can be seen all around the ballroom, reflecting what is happening on the dance-floor, and serving as a narrative device to introduce us, at the very beginning of the film\u2014once the lights of the ballroom have been switched on\u2014to each single dancer as they make and check their appearance in the mirror and on the stage. These mirrors serve a similar narrative function at the end of the film as each dancer individually leaves the ballroom before the lights go off, thus highlighting even further the perfectly technique are the various on the walls of the ballroom or exchanged by a [(...)](#ftn2) - 3 Vito Zagarrio sees this \"circularity\", as well what he calls the \"claustrophobic location of the [(...)](#ftn3) - 4 Maria Consuelo Cunha Campos, for her part, talks of \"teatrum mundi\" and of \"desespero tragic\u00f3mico\" [(...)](#ftn4) 12This comparison between the novel Family and Friends and the film Le Bal appears all the more pertinent as the structural parallel that we have just highlighted in conjunction a thematic parallel and cinematographic works explore the same metaphor, that of dancing as a symbol of the cyclical nature of time and history following the trauma of the Second World War. In both Brookner's novel and Scola's film, these photographs ongoing round of dances, suggests a cyclical vision of time and history. Through the rotation on the same dance-floor, year after year, of couples played by the very same actors performing the very same functions\u2014the romantic lover, the shady individual, the brute, the generous soul, etc.\u2014for each period of time, the film suggests that, following the epistemological rupture of World War no linear, chronological itself endlessly, all the are actually either choreographed round dancing\u2014with couples dancing the waltz, the polka, the rumba or the rock-and-roll, to name but a few\u2014or during the Popular Front or a French flag at the Liberation) in the middle of the ring. [3](#ftn3) And although dancing, music and clothing styles change according fashion historical periods, along other details as Coca-Cola bottles or beeping (which function as so many \"clues\" for the spectator), what the film fundamentally emphasizes is the immutability of Balzac as well as man's fundamental solitude: indeed, when the ball comes to an end and the lights go off, not a single dancing couple is shown as leaving together, thus highlighting the failure of any attempt at bonding beyond the limited spatial and temporal boundaries of the ballroom. [4](#ftn4) - 5 \"Anamorphosis\" is the term used in the visual arts to describe the reversal in perspective that occ [(...)](#ftn5) 13In the same way, the novel Family and Friends opens with couples dancing at a wedding (\"At the wedding they will dance, husbands with wives, fathers with daughters\", FF 17), and further figurative balls: \"Wait for the dancing to begin\" (FF 187). The circular structure of the novel, combined with the recurrence of the and their contribute to cyclical nature or \"dance\" of history. This phenomenon is all the more striking as a close examination of the photographs faithfully recording these family gatherings reveals that they can all be seen as anamorphic variations [5](#ftn5) of the original matrix forever repeated and reprinted through a sort of internal rotation, or \"dance\", of the protagonists. Indeed, this process presenting us with several photographs, and if we consider, instead, that he or she is actually showing only one photograph, always the same one, which opens up like a fan from the first page onward, and takes on, throughout the \"reading-journey\", new appearances. For one must admit that these wedding pictures always deal with the same subject-matter, the family portrait, always present the members of the family in the same position, surrounding the newlyweds, and above all, always present the exact same characters, Sofka, her children, and the rest of the family. Without even mentioning the four children Mimi, Betty, Frederick and Alfred, whose presence is recurrent, we can remark on the reiterated presence of the two half-sisters, Dolly and Nettie, who are explicitly mentioned in the first, third and fourth pictures (FF 8, 136, and 187), and on that of Lilie and Ursie in the last two pictures (FF 136 and 187). The presence of the children in the last row is specified in the first and last pictures (FF 7 and 187), and their interchangeable names (with they could well be the exact same children in all the photographs. Each picture provides the exact same details, such as the smile on the face of the newlyweds and their family, the faces that try to charm the photographer (third and fourth pictures), and even Sofka's hats, mentioned on the occasion of each of the three weddings that she attends (the fourth one taking place after her death). The absence of Sofka in the last picture does not, for that matter, contradict what we are saying, for Mimi, her daughter, replaces her. The resemblance between mother and daughter is emphasized by the presence of three details characteristic of the deceased\u2014the upright pose, the lace the inevitable in pale lace, with a rather imposing hat, very like her mother\", FF 187). has taken over the role of the matriarch (\"it is Mimi the matriarch\", FF 186), in the same way Alfred is now playing the role relinquished by Frederick (\"it is... Alfred the man of property\", FF 186). And the leitmotiv that we begin to recognize after each new photograph is reinforced by the recurrence, within the narration, of the by now familiar refrain: \"Here is... Here they are....\". The fundamental, immutable structures of the first photograph have thus been respected, and only the faces of the protagonists change through a sort of internal rotation, or dance, in which each character, in turn, comes to occupy the central position of the bride, the bridegroom, the matriarch, the close relative, etc. But it is always fundamentally the same picture which is presented to us, and the successive palimpsestic photographs are merely reproductions, or rather here re-writings, of the first seminal picture, which we may call the \"matrix\", all the more legitimately as it epitomizes, through the character of Sofka, the matriarch par excellence. - 6 See also differences between photography and cinema with to stasis, 14In strikingly similar relate the childhood and adolescence of the film director and his brothers and sisters in working-class Liverpool during and after World War II, and also explores, through graphic representations of both the Blitz and violence, the legacy of trauma\u2014in this case the collective trauma of the war and its aftermath, and the individual trauma induced by an abusive father and husband. Like the two works above, the film narrative presents both a circular and a cyclical structure, as it opens and closes (as in Family and Friends) with a wedding\u2014that of the elder sister at the beginning, and that of the brother at the very end\u2014and revolves around recurring photographic we shall see). Through a narrative device reminiscent of the loud flash in Le Bal, a distinct \"click\" signals a wedding picture being taken at the very beginning of the film, and this initial wedding-picture is then followed by a series of long, silent shots of the lined up family members whose striking photographic quality is, to large extent, due to their sepia-like colour, \"a desaturated brown which comes to signify the past, much as sepia can do in early Lumiere photographs\" (Powrie 31) and the image a faded photograph\" (Koresky 39). The recurrence, within the flow of the narrative, of these stilled images which, as film label of cinematic \"photo-album\" (Wilson 282), [6](#ftn6) a term we film from the structure film and Brookner's in portraits\", Phil them (Powrie 21), are not proper group portraits, as in the other two works, but \"pseudo-photographic images\", \"when the characters are posing photograph (Powrie 21, emphasis mine), \"looking into the lens as though they are about to have their picture taken\" (Koresky 112, emphasis mine). The actual freeze-frame effects of Bal are here fake freeze-frame effects, with Davies playing with the notions of stasis and motion, as well as with stasis and time, inherent in photography and film respectively. title. Despite this formal is the framed photographs on the ballroom wall in Le Bal, can be seen on the parlour wall. In addition to the many other \"frames-within-frames\" provided by doors, halls, and windows in the film, this \"further photographic image within the pseudo-photographic image\", to abyme of the narrative that we have highlighted in Le Bal and Family and Friends, with in this case, as an echo of the matriarch Sofka in Brookner's novel, over (Koresky 38), central position in the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of the photograph\" (Powrie 24). Finally, as in Family and Friends and Le Bal, the narrative in Davies's film is also punctuated by ritualized dances singing\u2014the which and yet intimately connected to the characters, who, in the very words the patriarch\u2014himself \"a good dancer\"\u2014are not enhance the circularity of 15What is particularly Distant Voices, Still Lives, as well as illuminating in that it sheds light on the other two works too through the same kind of rippling effect, is the way in which the backdrop of the dances and songs, themselves \"shaped by repetition 6), emphasizes, through two very powerful forms of visual arrest, both the recurrence of the images and the cyclical the of the violent and father. The choice of the term \"return\" is deliberate here for its connection with Freud's notion of the \"return of the repressed\", as what we have is in fact the visual expression, as states, the \"stasis in the film (Everett 2005, 193) reveals extent which the whole family remained and silence, long (Everett 2004, 10-11). In an interview with Michael Koresky, Davies has mentioned how the shooting of the film, and particularly the sequence in which his father is beating up his mother in the hallway, \"brought back really horrid memories of being calls \"the Death\" 33), as the wound, the \"double trauma\" the father \"who is hated because of his violence and the Law which he represents, but who is revered for the same reason\" (Powrie 32). 16If the family, specifically through the abuse committed by his father, is indeed one of the three \"loci of trauma\" from Koresky, are manifest in all his films (Koresky 30), Distant Voices, Still Lives hints at a third \"locus of trauma\", i.e. the war, present throughout the first part of the film, set in the 1940s, and whose terrifying reality suddenly irrupts into the film when the three children, out in the streets on an errand, have a narrow escape one day during a Blitz air raid as everybody else at home is running for shelter. Although very short, this intense sequence, as well as its lingering effect on Davies after the an \"emotional estrangement between the self and the environment, and between time and place\" which, according to Deleuze, is characteristic of [Davies]\" (Koresky 116) in the \"ghostlike\" beginning of the film (Koresky 114), when the empty house seems haunted by the memory of the family members' presence. Just like Brookner's Family and Friends and Scola's Le Bal, Distant Voices, Still Lives\u2014as reflected in the rather than stages, the epistemological rupture of the Second World War and the terrors and traumas it induced. - 8 In her article \"Dan\u00e7ando sobre um vulc\u00e3o: O baile, o fim de festa\", with its indirect reference to [(...)](#ftn8) 17In the dances and the photographs seem therefore to point to a vision of history as forever cyclical after a certain moment in time which, in all three cases, corresponds to the late 1930s with the rise of fascism and its culmination in World War II and the Holocaust. One might be tempted to see in the repetitive pattern of both the novel and the films a manifestation of what Dominick LaCapra, in repressed\" (LaCapra 1994, 169). In this book, LaCapra history as essentially \"traumatic\", echoing Lawrence of rupture between modernism postmodernism\" history in Brookner's Family and Friends might precisely be the symptom of the endless return of the trauma of the Holocaust, here not just psychologically, but also textually or Indeed, critics like Bryan Cheyette in Contemporary Jewish Writing in Britain and Ireland, the word \"Holocaust\" itself is hardly ever mentioned in Brookner's fiction, despite her direct autobiographical connection with these events as the most of her novels, and especially this one, but always in a covert, one might say \"repressed\", mode. For example, in Family and Friends, a most elliptical dialogue at the beginning of chapter 8 between the matriarch, Sofka, and a \"Safe. Here\", allusion to the horrifying events in the entire novel. - 9 \"For her husband, their father, is absent, gone before, dead, disgraced. Gambling, they even \"mourning sites\" (LaCapra 1998, 44) in his book History and Memory after Auschwitz. In this respect, Brookner's novel might function according fundamentally postmodern. The nature, evidence that \"\u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9\", \"that-has-been\", as Barthes puts it absence death, and particularly the absence of the father. [9](#ftn9) But beyond the quest for the missing father, the recurrence of the photographs as traces of the past in Brookner's Family and Friends might be a manifestation calls a \"compulsive and melancholic acting-out\" (LaCapra 1994, 14) of trauma in which the wedding photographs forever projecting an institutionalized picture of order and harmony could also be seen as a screen barring access to, while giving evidence of, the repressed trauma of the Holocaust, and thus preventing a \"working-through\" of that trauma. 19At a further level, one might see a manifestation of that same compulsion of repetition at work not just in the recurrence of the photographs in Family and Friends, but in the recurrence of Brookner's novels themselves\u2014twenty-four at the rate of one a year for two decades\u2014to the dismay and delight of both her critics and readers. It all works as if Brookner, through her prolific activity as a fiction without achieving kind of closure. In any case, whether the traumatic past has to do with the Holocaust, as in Family and Friends, or more generally with World War II and the human misery it caused, both individually and collectively, as in Le Bal and Distant Voices, Still Lives, the endless rotation of the dancers in or institutional metaphor for this never-ending \"acting out\" of trauma.
