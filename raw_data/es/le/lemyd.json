The document analysed was called \"Rheumatism\". Subsequently, a review of the literature was carried out in Science Direct / Clinical Key / Scielo databases in the period from 1999 to 2018.Conclusions There is scientific evidence that supports the efficiency of guaco used in the Kingdom of New Granada due its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, a vague description of the dosage of the guaco, signs, symptoms, and comorbidities, which are not mentioned in the prescription, hinders the understanding of its application and the thorough effectiveness of the treatment in order to control the of musculoskeletal system conditions. This tradition, consequently, lacks support for the medical treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.

The Cipriano Rodr\u00edguez Santa Mar\u00eda Historical Archives, of the Universidad de La Sabana, have multiple medical prescriptions from the late 18th Century and early 19th Century, including a prescription describing breakthroughs and medical practices in Colombia more than two centuries ago. The prescription was used for the treatment of disabling musculoskeletal conditions. This paper is intended to help us understand the scientific and cultural foundations supporting these relatively successful therapies, used during this period in history.Journey of and rheumatology over time The relationship between human diseases and by mankind such traditional of Crotona, philosopher and follower of Pythagoras around the 500 B.C., defined health and disease as: \u00abWhat preserves health is a balance between opposite qualities: dry and wet, cold and hot, bitter and sweet, etc. If any of those qualities prevails over the other, then disease develops... Diseases arise the predominance of one of and also from poor nutrition or other externalities, such as rain, place of residence, fatigue, anxiety, and similar factors. Health depends on the combination qualities and external factors the right [1](#bib0005) With regards to rheumatic diseases, the first references were made by the father of western medicine, Hippocrates de Cos (460370 BC), who used in his writings the word \u00abrheuma\u00bb, and is also associated with traditional medicine such as herbal and homeopathic medicine. [2](#bib0010) Cornelius Celsus (26 BC.-50 AC.) refers to word rheuma as a process of pain and inflammation (rubor et tumor, cum calore dolore). [3](#bib0015) Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689), an English Century chemist, philosopher, and botanist, in his book Manual for health with domestic medicine and pharmacy, associates sedentarism and alcohol abuse regions around the world, primarily in Egypt, investigating diseases of the bones, joints and muscles in mummies; he associated ancient DNA, and techniques of rheumatological diseases. [3](#bib0015) To speak about medicine associating a number of empirical and scientific knowledge brought from Europe, Asia and even from Africa, with the knowledge characteristic of rituals of slaves. The prescription described by William White (c. 1764-1834), a British merchant friend of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (1783-1830), who died in Caracas 4 years after the death of the Liberator in Santa Marta, was mostly influenced by Spanish knowledge. It is believed that the medical literature of that time was based on the Spanish Pharmacopeia and the Pharmacopeia Matritensis, brought from the Iberian Peninsula late in the 18th Century; these are jewels of the literature because of limited number and content. Spanish apothecaries in America mastered the art of medicine to such degree, that they even published similar books that then became indispensable for the training of American apothecaries. The shortage of apothecaries in the New Kingdom of Granada, in addition to insalubrity and epidemics, demanded a therapeutic religious communities such as Saint John of God; they were the only ones with the financial and hierarchical power to embrace medical knowledge. As time passed, a secular movement developed aimed at training apothecaries, a trade which was then practiced by an individual in a dispensary of herbal medicines called apothecary's shop. According to the evidence, Antonio Gorraez was one of the first lay apothecaries established in Santaf\u00e9. His apothecary shop was the first to open in Santaf\u00e9, with the help of a rich merchant. [6](#bib0030) So the apothecary, or the physician, was in charge of prescribing herbal medicines, and evolution in improving the Following a Withe has very effective prescription cure this disease, based on the use of guaco, in the same manner as it is used for snakebites. Mr. Withe speaks about a physician from Montpellier who had the following experiences: There was a black man in a farm in the isle of Santodomingo who had been crippled for seven years and he had to be taken out under the sun to warm him up; the man was given this medicine and after some time he became one of the most helpful and skillful slaves in the farm. Mr. Withe also took care of a crippled woman who crawled along the streets siting on a piece of cowhide; he advised her to take guaco, and six weeks later, the woman came to see him fully recovered. The prescription indicated to rub the guaco juice on the affected areas, take one spoon of the same juice before breakfast, drink the plant infusion also before breakfast several times the Octavio Arizmendi Posada Library, Universidad de La Sabana.

The most patient described by Mr. Withe, but the lack of data and definitions about this type of diseases at that time, make it difficult to determine exactly what was the disease of the patient discussed in this document. [8](#bib0040) The medicinal use of raw herbs is most common in developing or underdeveloped countries, due to economic, guaco; these are climbing plants from the Asteraceae family, which are morphologically similar and are native of the Southeastern part of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Its use in physical therapy has been documented for over 200 years and has been known by the nickname \"snake herb\" due to anti-inflammatory properties. [9](#bib0045) A search of the chemical components of guaco in the medical, botanical and biological literature, confirms its use and effects in the pathophysiological processes of a long list the role as a raw used in and should be differentiated for research purposes. [13](#bib0065) A special case regarding the use of guaco as the \"snake herb\" was during the led by outstanding personalities such as Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis and encouraged the arrival of other botanists including Alexander von Humboldt and Aim\u00e9 Bonpland, early in the 19th Century. They were guided by local botanists such as botanist and artist Francisco Javier Mat\u00eds, who were eager to learn about the wide variety of the flora in the New Granada. Mat\u00eds, was born in 1763, in Guaduas, from a low-income family and was passionate and talented for drawing plants. Fray Diego Garc\u00eda, who had been commissioned by Jos\u00e9 Celestino Mutis to collect plants, recognized Mat\u00eds's talent and appointed for the Royal Botanical Expedition where he served for over 30 years. While collecting, classifying and drawing, Mat\u00eds became particularly interested in the guaco leaf, and was the first one to identify its antivenom properties, based on the report of an afro-neogrenadin co-worker, negro P\u00edo - who remained in anonymity. [14](#bib0070) Based on this experience, Mat\u00eds practice as a healer and adopted the guaco leaf as an essential therapeutic resource to help people, taking care of patients in different areas which he visited regularly to monitor his patients. When he realized that his productive life was coming to the end, he trained Nicol\u00e1s C\u00e1rdenas as a healer to continue his legacy. Mat\u00eds died at 88 years old and it has been said that he was unable to personally follow on his last patient and who survived thanks to the effectiveness of the plant. There is no doubt that Mat\u00eds revolutionized herbal medicine with the use of the guaco leaf. Guaco became a legendary plant in the transition from the 18th to the 19th Century in the New Kingdom of Granada to the new Colombia.Evolution in the symptomatic management of rheumatology The current to modulate an uncontrolled chronic response of the study the pathophysiological mechanisms of the rheumatological diseases have resulted in an amazing progress over the last two decades, leading to the development of new therapeutic technologies, with specific treatment targets. the progression of the disease, preventing joint or visceral damage, and disability. The lives of many patients, similar to the description of Mr. Withe, have drastically changed; however, there are still some patients who are refractory to the various treatment options, or who have limitations due to the adverse effects of the new therapies. As a result of gene sequencing, of the development of pharmacogenomics, and the possibility to manage and analyze big data, the 21st Century is the age of precision or personalized medicine. [16,17](#bib0080) Just from a therapeutic perspective, for the first time we now face the deliver specific, to the rheumatological conditions in colonial times. [18](#bib0090) In light of the current medical literature, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic characteristics of guaco - particularly due to the presence coumarin - account for the improvement of symptoms described in Mr. Withe's prescription. While obviously the scientific foundations we know recognize, and which are supported by science, to diagnose and treat the diseases affecting the locomotor system, were not known in the 18th Century, it is worth noting the merits of delivering the prevailing limitations at the time. However, the vague information about the dosing and treatment parameters of guaco, make us wonder whether the results as genetics or gender; furthermore, in the past, the lack of knowledge about the disease prevented its optimal therapeutic management which the symptoms. Therefore, this guaco tradition had no scientific support for the medical treatment of osteomuscular disorders.Financing The research and publication were funded by the the authors are associated of The no conflict of interest to disclose.
