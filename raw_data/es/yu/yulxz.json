The first, due to its current nature; it has only been a few months since Epidemiology Collaboration).2 The second reason is that our group is working, albeit more modestly, along the same lines. In our project Diabetes 2008 to February 2009 that were performed in the Department of Biochemistry of the Hospital of La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, where tests are carried out for the hospital and the six primary care centres (PC). After excluding the 362 results were collected (from patients with a mean age of 64 \u00b1 14 years), 55% were made in women and 74% came from PC. Of these, creatinine was also requested in 3,461 (72%), the albumin/creatinine ratio was requested in 1,397 (29%), and a specific request for eGFR was made in only 80 (less than 2%). Subsequently, we calculated the eGFR in the 1,953 requests in which data were available for age, sex, and creatinine using the classical MDRD grade 3 in 13.2% and grades 1-2 in 1.6%. In women, 20% with grade 3 and 3.3% with grades 1-2. These data match the most recently reported data on prevalence differ from those Monta\u00f1\u00e9s an average discrepancy 98%. These differences may be explained by the application the classical formula (coefficient 186) rather than MDRD-IDMS (coefficient 175) PC versus the nephrology referral centre, 55% women vs. 30% and 81% with grades 4-5 vs. 63%. However, on the other hand, the differences are so small that we can say that the new CKD-EPI formulas are tools that are as useful as MDRD and we hope that they will allow to awareness "}
