Results: From 367 DILI cases, 8% were attributed to HDS. An increasing trend in HDS-hepatotoxicity was and alanine transaminase (p = .008 and p = .021, respectively), had more re-exposure events to the culprit HDS (14% vs 3% vs 0%; p = .026), and had more severe and fatal/liver transplantation outcomes (21% vs 12% vs 13%; Compared to other DILI cohorts, less of accidental re-exposure.
