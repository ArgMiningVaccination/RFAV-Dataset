The prevalence of this phenomenon varies from study to study due to a lack of consensus around how to define and measure peer sexual cybervictimization. This study aims to contribute to this research topic by developing age participated in this study. Cross-validation was performed using EFA and CFA. In a second step, a multi-group analysis was conducted to compare the boys than in girls. Prevalence rates varied from 17 to less the Personal adolescence. Antecedentes/Objetivo: El estudio de la ciberconducta sexual en la adolescencia ha recibido mucha atenci\u00f3n en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, especialmente la referida a los riesgos que suponen la exposici\u00f3n a la pornograf\u00eda, las solicitudes sexuales indeseadas y el hostigamiento sexual basado en el g\u00e9nero. La prevalencia del fen\u00f3meno var\u00eda entre los diferentes estudios debido a una falta de consenso en la definici\u00f3n y medida del constructo cibervictimizaci\u00f3n sexual. Este trabajo pretende contribuir en esta \u00e1rea, desarrollando y validando una escala para medir victimizaci\u00f3n sexual online. M\u00e9todo: Una muestra de 601 adolescentes de dos ciudades espa\u00f1olas (edad media 14,06) participaron en el estudio. Se realiz\u00f3 una validaci\u00f3n cruzada empleando AFE y AFC, as\u00ed como un an\u00e1lisis multigrupo para comparar la equivalencia de la medida por sexo. Resultados: se confirm\u00f3 un modelo de segundo orden compuesto por dos factores (Cibervictimizaci\u00f3n sexual ambigua y Cibervictimizaci\u00f3n sexual personal) invariante por sexo. Los an\u00e1lisis indicaron diferencias significativas en la dimensi\u00f3n ambigua, siendo m\u00e1s frecuente en ellos. Los datos revelaron una prevalencia entre el 17 y 26%, siendo menor la implicaci\u00f3n en la forma personal. Conclusiones: Se propone una medida v\u00e1lida e invariante en ambos sexos de la cibervictimizaci\u00f3n sexual por parte de los iguales en la adolescencia. Internet uses and the amount of time adolescents spend connected has turned the online world into another context where can develop and learn, engaging appropriate and adjusting cultural norms [Steinberg, 2013](#bib0155)). Studies to date and personal information with the of making their sexual image public ( [Ringrose, Gill, because of the risks that these experiences may entail for young people's personal and social development [Livingstone & Smith, 2014](#bib0105)), but also because more than the and sexual may become maladjusted, with some adolescents now feeling themselves at the of online sexual victimization ( [Hill & Kearl, 2011](#bib0080)). Research face-to-face Rinehart & the main reasons for this variability in results lies in the wide range of theoretical models and behaviours under analysis. From a risk perspective, the focus has turned to analyzing 2014; Mitchell et al., more than 30% of having been to sexual ( 2014](#bib0090)), aggression ( [\u00c1lvarez-Garc\u00eda, Dobarro, & or prevalence perceived as the or of desire and & sexual cybervictimization ( [Van Royen et al., 2015](#bib0180)). Another reason for of results concerns a with studies on face-to-face sexual violence, where some authors have distinguished ( Crooks, no conclusive studies on which would include exposure to pornography or to another type of sexual content, and a form of cybervictimization based on sexual has defined peer cybervictimization based on three dimensions: two of a sexual nature, unwanted sexual solicitations 2007](#bib0195)). The American Association of University Women (AAUW) survey, which is widely used in the study [Hill 2011](#bib0080)), but the psychometric properties. This study aims to build on this line of research by validating an instrument for measuring sexual peers an online environment ( [Van Royen et al., 2015](#bib0180)), and which may unpleasant for [AAUW, contexts given that: 1) it continues to be one of the most frequently used tools in the study of face-to-face peer sexual harassment; 2) it adopts a developmental approach the phenomenon, linking it to based on the risk model; takes into account gender differences in experiencing this phenomenon. In this respect, some studies have found that boys and girls interpret the same behaviours differently, having 2005](#bib0030)). It is for this reason that the second aim will be to analyze whether the models are invariant by gender, the emotional impact on both sexes. Given that the development of specific instruments to measure peer sexual cybervictimization in available literature is still scarce, an exploratory approach will be taken in order to determine the possible dimensions underlying the phenomenon. In this with previous studies ( [Barak, 2005; Van Royen we would expect is a transfer between contexts and continuity between the online and cybervictimization. Furthermore, some studies have reported on associated with sensation-seeking behaviours ( [Baumgartner et which is produce a positive correlation between sexual secondary-level students (ESO) chosen through intentional sampling from four schools, two in Seville (n=345) and two in C\u00f3rdoba (n=256), participated in the study. The schools were selected based on two criteria: they were public-run and were located in mid-level socioeconomic areas. Their ages ranged from 12 to 16 years (M=14.06, SD=1.25), with distributed across school in their first year of secondary education (n=150), 21% in their second year (n=126), 34.4% in their third year (n=207), and 19.6% in their fourth year of secondary ( et al., 2010](#bib0140)) was adapted to the online context. For this purpose: 1) seven of the original 13 items were removed because they involved a direct physical component (e.g., Brushed up against you in a sexual way on purpose); 2) the remaining items were adapted so that they specifically referred to behaviours that occurred in an online context; 3) four items were added which assessed context-specific (online) in how often have the following things happened to you since the school year started via social networks or via mobile phone without you wanting it to happen? Answer by thinking about those things that have happened \"How you when it happened to you?\", with response options ranging from 0 (It didn't bother me) to 4 (I felt really bad). Online victimization in dating relationships. four and nine items respectively, which assessed the frequency with which they had you sexual photos or naked photos of himself/herself knowing that you didn't want this; Your partner has sent you a threatening text message). The online intrusiveness scale comprised four items that assessed the frequency with which they had received, over the last six months, constant attempts at communication by their partner following an argument (e.g., we're annoyed with each other and I don't respond to my partner, he or she leaves me lots of private messages). The internal consistency indices were satisfactory: Sexual cybervictimization (= .76), Non-sexual (= .78), several people at the same time over the Internet (e.g., I have flirted with other people via social networks whilst in a relationship), and giving personal contact details to people they have just met. Internal consistency was .66. Despite presenting a the item-total correlation corresponding made up the scale ranked higher or equal to .30, so the decision was made not to change or deviate from received a favourable report from the Research Ethics Committee of the Autonomous Region of Andalusia.Data of the instrument was performed, combining Exploratory Factor Analysis for 50% the sample (randomly selected) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for the 50% in order to explore and confirm the structure of the SCV measure. In the EFA, the participants were 309 adolescents, a mean age The EFA utilized the Geomin rotation method. Second, given that the literature points to significant differences by gender in the behaviour under breaking the analysis into two stages: 1) in the configural model, the thresholds and factor loadings are free in both groups, the residual variances are fixed to 1 across all groups, and the factor means are fixed to 0 in both groups; and 2) in the metric-scalar model, the thresholds and factor loadings are constrained to be equal in both groups, the residual variances are fixed to 1 in Group 1 and free in the other group, and the factor means are fixed to 0 in Group 1 and free in the other group. In order to confirm factorial invariance by gender, the the configural and metric-scalar models. If the outcome of the test is not significant, this confirms that the model is invariant at the metric-scalar level, allowing us to compare factors CFI fit indices were for correlation analyses between the SCV scale and a descriptive analysis of the items that assessed peer sexual cybervictimization. A significant floor effect was observed having about your sexual (0.82)||3.03 photos.||0.23 |10. of a provocative nature or showing a part of the exploratory factor analysis to approximately 50% of the sample (n=309). The correlations between items varied from .21 to .64. Due to the exploratory nature of the analysis, one-factor, two-factor and discarded because it yielded a solution in which a single factor was made up of less than three items. The one-dimensional solution [X2(27)=84.91; 7 (Making a sexual joke) was excluded given that its saturation was greater than 1. The first factor included items that made reference to ambiguous sexual exchanges and which was called Ambiguous sexual Cybervictimization (ASCV). The second factor was labelled as (PSCV), because as private sexual content. All greater and higher than correlation between both factors factors between the factors was very high (.94). As such, two models that were more parsimonious with the results found were tested: a one-dimensional model two-factor [X2(27)=61.67; RMSEA=.068; CFI=.97], whereas the fit of second-order model same as the first-order two-factor model [X2(26)=60.94; RMSEA=.069; CFI=.97]. given that it allowed us to analyze two forms of sexual victimization factorial invariance of the second-order model between boys and girls was tested by means of a multi-group analysis. Both the the of increment between the chi-squared of two nested models (Trd=38.99; p=.18) in Frequency to who reported never having received any of the behaviours and 1 being those who experienced this on occasions. Prevalence in ASCV and in PSCV involved reported feeling more bothered than the other two groups regardless of gender.Discussion The aim of this study was to analyze peer sexual cybervictimization in adolescence based on the ( [AAUW, 2001](#bib0010)) to the online context. CFA confirmed a potential to given one of the main challenges in measuring sexual victimization is the different ways in which boys and girls interpret this phenomenon ( [Hill & Kearl, 2011](#bib0080)). This sexual exchanges to the person receiving these messages. This was the most frequent factor across both genders, with 25% being involved, and it was associated with cyberdating practices. This relationship may account for exploration ( [Subrahmanyan & Smahel, 2011](#bib0165)), as they use the Internet and social networks as another means of more frequently that the emotional impact was less in boys than in girls would the view according to the male population, sharing sexual content should seen negative light ( [Ringrose et al., 2012](#bib0135)), reflecting a different development of sexuality for both genders ( [Steinberg, 2013](#bib0155)). The reference to receiving insults about the victim's sexual as well as requests for unwanted personal sexual images. In this case, the tone of these behaviours was more aggressive and focused on specific and intimate of the behaviours at least once, these students, half said that they felt bothered by it, which is consistent with earlier [Van Royen et al., 2015](#bib0180)). to those outlined by [Barak (2005)](#bib0015), where the author distinguished between active passive forms of online sexual harassment. Active forms would potential recipients of the content, especially when said material is posted in public virtual spaces. Although we are unable to determine whether ASCV in study took place Future studies could explore whether these behaviours are experienced in public or private places, and if this determines the fact that they are perceived as more or less disturbing. In short, the two dimensions differ not only sexual cybervictimization content but substantive validity and contributes to the debate surrounding the sexual cybervictimization in adolescence. Given the this a contribution to the study of the phenomenon and to the development and validation of a scale Spain. Future than half of boys and approximately 40% of girls who reported having experienced these behaviours were not bothered by it, which seems to indicate a normalization of this sexual cyberconduct, as we have with sexual the need to design psychoeducational interventions that teach young people to develop and express their sexuality without having to be rude or aggressive, thus of perceived the psychological correlates victimization has found that peer sexual victimization affects the mental health and psychological of whether both forms of cybervictimization are associated same way with adolescent psychological adjustment. The [Chiodo et al., 2009](#bib0050)), we expected to observe the same association in an online context. The design of this study, however, does not allow for a conclusion to be drawn about the directionality of this relationship. Future longitudinal studies will help to confirm whether peer sexual cybervictimization is a risk factor for sexual cybervictimization in dating relationships and whether this risk is greater in girls. This study sought to adapt and validate the peer sexual victimization scale to the online context in the Spanish adolescent population. The observed fit indices the phenomenon both sexes represents one of the first contributions in Spain. However, this research has some limitations that are worth mentioning. The approach taken in this study was to consider two sexual victimization factors and one second-order confirm this did not look at whether instances of sexual cybervictimization came from same or 2015](#bib0160)). conclude, speed at which the Internet grows and evolves and the new uses offered by new technologies, the behaviours under assessment run the risk of partiality. From this including a wider range of behaviours. This research is part of the research project Parejas y redes de iguales en la adolescencia funded by the MINECO (PSI2013-45118-R). Noelia "}
