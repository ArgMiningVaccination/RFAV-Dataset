I'd love to meet people who are passionate about self-improvement. People who wish to live a conscious life. People who wish to accomplish something while maintaining a sense of balance in life. - Who should join? If you are into spirituality and self-development. If you want to improve your friend circle, share your wisdom and your life path. - What will you do at our events? Share your stories, learn from each other, help each other, and play games (like Cash Flow and others). P.S. It is not a networking organization. Join this group if you want to make friends rather than sell your products or services. You can, of course, share how your products and services have changed your life, but not with the intention of selling them. The main goal is to make new friends. If I feel that you pretend to care but really want to sell your services, you will be blocked. This group is about friendships and not a job.
