Method: this is an epidemiological, ecological study, with panel and trend analysis from 2016 to 2020. The population consisted of adolescents aged 9 to 13 years. The environmental variables were coverage rates, the municipal index of human development, income, education, longevity; and the rate of violence. and the panel regression model were used, in the Health for all regions analyzed. Moreover, these rates are associated with factors related to the application of the first dose and to aspects inherent to the social environment, relevant information to this vaccination campaign presents a strong influence of the environment and age as factors fatores do ambiente social e as taxas de cobertura da vacina contra o papilomav\u00edrus humano (HPV) nos adolescentes do estado de Minas Gerais.

Method Study design This is an epidemiological, ecological study, in which panel and trend analysis were carried out. Location The study was conducted in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Period The study was conducted from 2016 to 2020. Study population The study population consisted of female and male adolescents, 9 to 13 years, who were vaccinated against HPV. The period and age group framing of this study is justified since it focuses the target audience of the vaccine in question and encompasses the completeness/consolidation of the online system data from 2016. The state of Minas Gerais consists of 853 municipalities, divided into 19 Regional Health Superintendence (Superintend\u00eancias Regionais de Sa\u00fade - SRS) and 9 Regional Health Management Units (Ger\u00eancias Regionais de Sa\u00fade - GRS).

Data processing and analysis For data analysis, the Stata software, version 16.0, was used. The vaccination goals for D2 of the HPV vaccine were estimates by year and by SRS and GRS. For trend analysis, the Prais-Winsten autoregressive model was employed, using the vaccination rate (by year and by SRS and GRS) as dependent variables and the year of the study as independent variable (2016-2020). For this, the rate of vaccine coverage per year, per SRS and GRS had to be transformed to a logarithmic scale to reduce the heterogeneity of variance of the residues from the time series regression analysis. After the analytical procedure of trend analysis, the annual percent change (APC) was performed for the dependent variable analyzed. analytical procedure, level of 5% was the calculation of the 95% confidence interval values of coefficient b1 (standard error) were generated by the statistical analysis program; the t refers to the 95% percentile of the T-student distribution test and corresponds to 4 degrees of freedom (2.776), which refers to the five years of analysis. Panel analysis was also performed, since this type of analysis makes it possible identify structural changes in the relationship the that it accompanies a given sample of individuals (regions) in time. In total, 28 SRS/GRS from the state of Minas Gerais were evaluated, all of which presented complete data in all variables, thus constituting a balanced panel analysis by SRS/GRS and by year of analysis. The random effect model was adopted, since regional variations are identified by random oscillations around a constant with regression is demonstrated by the formula below: In the formula, Y represents the dependent variable, represents the variation observed in Y when the independent variable, X, increases in one unit and indicates the stochastic nature of the model. Subscript i indicates that observations are indexed by case. Subscripts i and t report that the observations are indexed, respectively, by GRS and time. The model becomes more powerful since information is accumulated on the relationship between sociodemographic and socio-environmental conditions for all GRS and years. Finally, the Hausman test was performed to verify the consistency of the model. Ethical aspects Since this study used free access data, the project was not required to be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee, resolution the in Research Ethics in Brazil: Resolution no. 466/12 of 2014;12(1). https://doi.org/10.1590/S1679-45082014ED3077 [https://doi.org/10.1590/S1679-45082014ED... ](https://doi.org/10.1590/S1679-45082014ED3077). regarding HPV vaccination rates in the period from 2016 to 2020, related to the 19 SRS and 8 GRS in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. [Table 1]() shows HPV vaccine coverage rates by age group, year, and trend. We observed that the variations in coverage rates had a higher proportion in in 2017 the highest rate occurred D1. On the rate occurred for the older ages, with the 13-year-old age group being the one that stood out the most from the other groups. Regarding trend analyses, we found that only the 9-year-old age group was increasing, and all other age groups were decreasing. Analysis of HPV vaccine coverage in the State of Minas Gerais.

[Table 3]() presents the data regarding the environment over the years. For the variables related to the human development index (HDI), data were presented only for the year 2016, since this variable did not change over the years, since its estimate was carried out by the 2010 demographic census.

Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2016-2020 Finally, the panel analysis ( [Table 4]()) shows the final model of the study, balanced by SRS/SRG and by year of analysis, for the group of 9-year-olds, due to its power of significance. Final model for the group of 9-year-old in the State of Minas Gerais. Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2016-2020 The independent variables coverage rate a p-value<0.005; this model was explained with a power of 93.2% of statistical significance. Regarding the consistency of the model, the p-value was 0.0025 by the Hausman test, which justifies the use of the fixed effects model being more significant for this study. Discussion The results of this study showed that HPV vaccine coverage rates in the state of Minas Gerais are well below the expected targets for all the SRS/SRG and groups, and most regions showed a stationary and decreasing trend. Regarding the associated with the coverage rate of the HPV of 2017 small difference in the coverage rates of D2 compared to the previous year, this result is justified by the fact that 2017 was the year in which the HPV vaccine was introduced for the male adolescent population JML, Pillsbury A, S, Donovan B, Macartney K, et al.

This is an extremely relevant factor within the context of HPV vaccination; the population in this age group is the one that benefits most from this immunobiological, since people have not yet been exposed to the viral subtypes of HPV - which makes the vaccine have a greater power of efficacy and immunogenicity against the subtypes of the applied vaccine88.
