Thus, several states have implemented programs to sponsor its cultivation and research. This paper analyzes the policies generated by the Mexican government to promote the establishment of Jatropha plantations for biofuel purposes. The supporting schemes, the state-of-the-art national research and the environmental implications of establishing this new crop were reviewed to assess their impact on small-scale producers that participated in these programs. Scientific research on native germplasm indicates the existence of great diversity in Mexico, including non-toxic ecotypes, from which highly productive varieties are being developed. However, when the plantation programs started, producers were not technically or economically prepared to face the risks associated with this new crop, nor was there a good internal supply-chain. Consequently, some programs have been abandoned and the low productivity and income generated by the plantations have not satisfied producer expectations. Thus, there is a need to review the national strategy to support this crop and to develop a well-structured biofuel market in the country for the success of Jatropha plantations in Mexico.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2014-06-10", "cleaned_text": "Drivers and Consequences of the First Jatropha curcas its excessive consumption, as the primary source of energy in Mexico is petroleum [ [2](#B2-sustainability-06-03732)]. Therefore, new initiatives have been considering the use of clean energy to supply national and international demands. In this regard, in 2006, the Secretary of Energy (Secretar\u00eda de Energ\u00eda.) (SENER) provided studies to determine the feasibility cultivation of biofuels could be used when blended with petroleum in the Mexican transportation system to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. This proposal was publicly announced in 2008 by President Felipe Calder\u00f3n [ [4](#B4-sustainability-06-03732)], and the \"Law of Development and Promotion of Bioenergy\" (Ley de Promoci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de los Bioenerg\u00e9ticos) was also promoted in that year [ [5](#B5-sustainability-06-03732)], together with the \"Law for the Sustainable Use of Energy\" (Ley para el Aprovechamiento Sustentable de la Energ\u00eda) [ [6](#B6-sustainability-06-03732)]. Both laws promote and regulate research and production of biomass for energy purposes without compromising food security. These regulations were especially directed to provide incentives for the agriculture sector, in crisis since 1980 [ [7](#B7-sustainability-06-03732)], by supporting employment generation and the development of rural planting biofuel crops. Within this strategy, introduction of bioenergy sources [ [8](#B8-sustainability-06-03732)] to emphasize its the Mexican countryside by procuring incentives to stimulate the establishment of energy crops to produce biodiesel and bioethanol. The program considered the introduction of biofuels as additives to petro-fuels and the investment of more than four million dollars over the following five years to enable the domestic refining industry to be able to provide these additives. The Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) (Secretar\u00eda del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales) was responsible for verifying sustainability issues related to biofuels, and the of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) (Secretar\u00eda de Agricultura, Ganader\u00eda, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentaci\u00f3n) was responsible for implementing rural programs, such as sugar beet, sugarcane and sweet sorghum to produce bioethanol and castor plant, oil palm and Jatropha to produce biodiesel [ [9](#B9-sustainability-06-03732)]. SAGARPA assigned economic resources to support projects for seed production and the propagation of these cultivars, and although the SENER [ [8](#B8-sustainability-06-03732)] warned of the need to achieve greater development in the biofuel processing industry to satisfy projected goals, several states in Mexico focused their rural development policies on the establishment of biofuel crops, such as Jatropha curcas. 2. the species is used in the food-chain; and (2) the well-known reputation that its seeds are rich in good quality oil and that the plant is able to grow in low fertility soils with Therefore, cultivars that are able fruits under poor conditions would allow for their establishment on many eroded lands Mexico. Hence, the cultivation of Jatropha be lands. was feasible for the National Forest Commission (CONAFOR) (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Forestal) to provide incentives for commercial plantations to use Jatropha [ [3](#B3-sustainability-06-03732)]. Since 2007, this commission has operated a national program having a specific title, \"Pi\u00f1\u00f3n de Aceite (Pi\u00f1\u00f3n de Aceite = Pinion Oil), Jatropha curcas\", to support to economic support from other government agencies, such as the National System for Oil Production (Comit\u00e9 Nacional Sistema Producto Oleaginosas) and the National Research Institute for Forestry, Agricultural and Livestock (INIFAP) (Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agr\u00edcolas y Pecuarias), who considered that future European goals for substituting Jatropha cultivation Mexico were more than 2.6 million hectares [ [13](#B13-sustainability-06-03732)]. The study also mentioned that the best soils and climate for this species were located in the southeast of Mexico. Given this information, in 2007, various southeastern states in Mexico planned to cultivate thousands of hectares (ha), including Veracruz (200,000), Yucat\u00e1n (6000), Michoac\u00e1n (6000) and Chiapas (20,000) [ [14](#B14-sustainability-06-03732)]. 3.2. The Actors Leading the First States to Cultivate Jatropha [Figure alleviate rural crises with national incentives and partly to lead the way as future providers of alternative energy for developed countries [ [15](#B15-sustainability-06-03732), [16](#B16-sustainability-06-03732)]. project, proclaiming the for farmers, reforestation, mitigation of effects from climate change, the use of marginal and degraded lands and national and foreign investment to create jobs. To meet these goals, the state of Chiapas created the Institute of Bioenergetics and Alternate Energies in 2007 (IBEA) (Instituto de Bioenerg\u00e9ticos y Energ\u00edas Alternativas) and also installed a biodiesel refinery, with up to 20,000 liters of daily capacity, as well as planned to use the product in the public transportation system in its capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez. Additionally, the government proposed the establishment of ten thousand hectares of Jatropha plantations to provide fuel for the local bio-refinery [ [7](#B7-sustainability-06-03732)]. In Michoac\u00e1n, the state, together with international companies, supported the establishment of cultivars and one commercial bio-refinery to produce and sell biodiesel from Jatropha to the rest of the country with a capacity of nine million liters per year [ [17](#B17-sustainability-06-03732), [18](#B18-sustainability-06-03732)]. Furthermore, the governments of Yucatan, Veracruz and Quintana Roo sought the collaboration of foreign investors in the oil processing chain, while promoting the establishment of plantations of this species among local farmers, with the state stimulus Assistance Scheme [12](#B12-sustainability-06-03732)]. Additional materials required and labor costs for harvest had to be covered by producer holdings the the main reasons they sought to cultivate from CONAFOR only corresponds with plantations support from this Independent reports correspond or in planting this specific species; (2) the location of the site must be inside the municipalities approved by CONAFOR, who considered the map of potential areas provided by INIFAP [ [13](#B13-sustainability-06-03732)] to determine land use; and (3) seedlings establish to find native plants in many states of the country, like Michoac\u00e1n, Chiapas, Yucatan, Quintana Roo and Veracruz [ [26](#B26-sustainability-06-03732)]. However, most of them are wild or have been grown with little human care and are simply used as living fences and/or for medicinal purposes by locals that did not consider their commercial applications [ [27](#B27-sustainability-06-03732)]. Additionally, studies on seed productivity in the native provenances were not available at the time of the first commercial plantations, so it was risky to start commercial plantations without having elite Mexican accessions. This situation led to authorities in charge of the programs to decide on the importation of seeds from countries where commercial plantations [ more susceptible to new diseases. As a result, in Chiapas, the seeds 40% germination, and the resulting seedlings [7](#B7-sustainability-06-03732)]. 3.4.2. Phytosanitary Situation [30](#B30-sustainability-06-03732)]. In the states of Yucatan Quintana Roo, labor workers have reported an unknown reported in about 25% of the plantations of these states [ [32](#B32-sustainability-06-03732)], and it may be the cause of these losses. 3.4.3. Agricultural Schemes [19](#B19-sustainability-06-03732), [22](#B22-sustainability-06-03732)], monocultures in order to maximize production. In the states of Chiapas and Veracruz, CONAFOR, the main promoter of Jatropha, conditioned its economic support to the establishment of no less than 1,600 plants per hectare (3 \u00d7 than 70% survival, most producers also opted for the a higher number displaced Mexican traditional crops, such as maize and beans or polycrops, and some producers, who did not want to displace their traditional crops, cleared or [7](#B7-sustainability-06-03732)]. research found net losses of 10%-35% among 133 producers in central Chiapas [ [33](#B33-sustainability-06-03732)], and another revealed that almost 49% of the first producers of Jatropha in three municipalities of the state had abandoned their cultivation by 2012 [ [34](#B34-sustainability-06-03732)]. There is no data available on the current situation of the plantations in this state. In Michoacan, one study covering three rural communities indicated that more than 50% of the small-scale producers not satisfied with the results of because the production investment was higher than expected and the prices of the seeds were lower than the prices they to receive for sorghum corn company still maintains a webpage informing of the high-scale production of Jatropha cultivars, it has not been updated since 2011 [ [35](#B35-sustainability-06-03732)]. In the states of Yucatan and Quintana Roo, journalistic notes reported that crops were severely affected and most labor workers in the Jatropha chain lost their jobs [ [31](#B31-sustainability-06-03732)], although there are still private companies growing Jatropha there. For the state of Veracruz, these authors did not find public information from the results of the plantations established there. 3.6. Current State Policies [36](#B36-sustainability-06-03732), [37](#B37-sustainability-06-03732)]. The states of Michoac\u00e1n, Yucatan and Quintana Roo do not have any dependency on promoting biofuels ( [Table 1](#sustainability-06-03732-t001)). The state is the only one maintaining a dependency (INVERBIO (Instituto Veracruzano de Bioenerg\u00e9ticos)) on promoting biofuels, but until now, there was no available information on successful projects from Jatropha plantations in the state [ [38](#B38-sustainability-06-03732)]. At the national level, until 2013, CONAFOR still provided economic support to establish a total of 8000 hectares of Jatropha in several states of the country [ [39](#B39-sustainability-06-03732)], while SAGARPA still maintains its program to support research projects on biofuels and the propagation of oily plants, [41](#B41-sustainability-06-03732), [42](#B42-sustainability-06-03732)]. Although most of the plants are toxic, to the presence of alkaloids, known phorbol esters, possible to find in the region of Totonacapan, in places, such as Papantla in Veracruz, Huasteca in Hidalgo and Sierra in Puebla. Indeed, in many towns of these regions, there is a long history of their use in traditional dishes [ [26](#B26-sustainability-06-03732)]. 3.7.2. Research on National Germplasm [26](#B26-sustainability-06-03732), Since the years 2006 and 2007, national specimen collections were started by INIFAP [ [29](#B29-sustainability-06-03732)] and other research centers in Michoac\u00e1n, Chiapas, Morelos and Veracruz. Collectively, research has found a higher genetic diversity and yield in as five years is needed to determine actual plantation production capabilities [ [44](#B44-sustainability-06-03732)]. [45](#B45-sustainability-06-03732)]. UNAM was interested toxic specimens were part of the studies. By the year 2008, the Jatropha Network (JN) was initiated with the support of the National System of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (SINAREFI-SAGARPA) (Sistema Nacional de Recursos Fitogen\u00e9ticos para la Alimentaci\u00f3n y la Agricultura). Six research institutions were the first members of the JN: Colegio de Postgraduados, University of Veracruz, Developing Center of Biotic Products from the National Polytechnic Institute (Centro de Desarrollo de Productos Bi\u00f3ticos del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional (IPN-CEPROBI)), INIFAP, Technological University of the Huasteca (Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de la Huasteca) and the private company, Jatro Bioenergy and Oil Seeds. This network studied but been the morphological and of more than 200 provenances of J. curcas collected from five states. The JN also sent seeds to the national germplasm bank for their preservation and determined the toxicity in [46](#B46-sustainability-06-03732)]. Despite this valuable information, the JN has not published more reports after this date; however, it has funded the regional dishes prepared with Jatropha seeds and flour at the First and Second Festival of Agrodiversity and Agroproducts organized by the Agriculture Ministry in 2012 and 2013. 4. Discussion 4.1. National Policies and Their Implications in the Production Chain [40](#B40-sustainability-06-03732)]. However, now, in 2014, there is no legislation to coerce the compulsory use of biofuels by PEMEX, and this compromise is still not fulfilled. Here, it is important to point out that Mexico still has a national monopoly on the distribution and use of fuels, through the national company, PEMEX. Therefore, private markets to purchase fuels are practically nonexistent. This means that, without government support or technology to use these new energies, there are no national markets for biofuels. Thus, only those who have enough resources to process seeds and export the oil are able to very sell their product. Similar experiences have been reported in some African countries, where the application of different models of contractual arrangements have been established to solve these problems [ [47](#B47-sustainability-06-03732)]. In this regard, the law for the promotion and development of biofuels still needs improvement, since it has not considered direct incentives for those that desire to participate in the biofuels industry [ [5](#B5-sustainability-06-03732)]. Mexican politicians need to analyze and review this law and other national regulations to stimulate the production chain of biofuels reach of the majority of Mexican producers. Good examples of biofuel success at the national level can be taken from Brazil, which made agreements biodiesel with petro-fuels and support large investment in research and technology developments to perfect the transformation processes and reduce manufacturing costs [ [48](#B48-sustainability-06-03732)]. and Financial Support Schemes [Table 1](#sustainability-06-03732-t001)), the insufficient financial support for the years that this crop requires for its establishment until it and Quintana Roo, where producers are searching for financial help to cope with the unexpected events in their plantations [ [31](#B31-sustainability-06-03732)]. In this regard, if we examine [Table 2](#sustainability-06-03732-t002), we can see that economic support was a major reason for establishing this new sufficient for this type of crop at small-scale volumes. The low profitability of Jatropha has been as a major problem for small-scale producers in countries like Kenya should consider longer-term of polycrop systems to increase incomes during the first years for the case of small-scale producers. Regarding technical support, it is important to although national state technical support to plantations [ the time the programs started, it was unlikely for the technicians in any region of the country to have experience in this type of monoculture. For example, the first guides for Jatropha cultivation in Mexico were not published until the second semester of 2011 [ [29](#B29-sustainability-06-03732), [43](#B43-sustainability-06-03732)]. Therefore, the knowledge of seed quality and requirements for fertilizers and pest control were still under development by the time the plantations were initiated. These conditions promoted improper selection, packaging and storage seeds Consequently, they presented serious problems for germination (less than 40% was documented in Chiapas), and seedlings had very little vigor, resulting in fewer to respond to the problems with this crop. The case of Veracruz is special; it possesses and has used non-toxic Jatropha as a in rural continued growing their non-toxic plants and selling their seeds for food uses inside their region. It is likely, however, that the income generated here is not big enough to figure in any public statistical information. |State||Main reason||Reference| |Michoacan||To sell to Jatropha most of the plantations were established on farmlands, and there are no from Jatropha establishment on new diseases that imported Jatropha seeds brought to Mexico could be a risk for national germplasm and other crops; (3) the presence of Jatropha pests has forced producers to use agrochemicals to the dependence on external inputs and delivering more contaminants the environment; and (4) in places where producers deforested land to plant Jatropha, there may some of water catchment capacity and biodiversity. Therefore, some actions required avoid these negative ecological impacts. Mexico should improve its Law for the Sustainable Use Energy [6](#B6-sustainability-06-03732)], ensuring improve their imported seeds dubious quality. Later, the bio-refineries in Chiapas Michoac\u00e1n [ [37](#B37-sustainability-06-03732)]. Therefore, at present, places to sell the seeds are uncertain, discouraging many small-scale producers from a preference studies show profits in the middle-term exported the In regard, the national non-toxic germplasm is a great resource, not only for biofuel purposes, but also for food.
