And of the 65% of Farmworkers who use herbal medicine, 79% seek treatment for an acute condition and over 90% have found them very helpful.

At the sound of rain, Yatziry is transported back to family dinners on the beach in Oaxaca. After a long day of work, her grandparents would take little Yatziry to watch the sun set into the Pacific, rain or shine. Yatziry's large brown eyes smile as she recalls this memory, one that is filled with such warmth, love and security. Yatziry lived in a small village near Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, Mexico. Her parents entrusted her to the care of her grandparents so that they could seek out economic opportunities for their family in Napa, California. Each day,Yatziry would help her grandmother at their barbacoa stand, marinating the chivo (goat) meat her grandfather had butchered, and then steaming it all day long. The vapor from the pot would radiate out through holes of the clay top, warming for the next customer. Yatziry remembers the mouthwatering combination of juicy chivo, soft tortillas, salsa verde and a squeeze of lime. Though they did not have a lot of money, this was a very happy time in Yatziry's life. Starting a New Life When Yatziry was seven years old, her parents brought her to the US to live with them in Napa, California. They were able to place her in a bilingual school, easing her transition, but certainly not eradicating the tremendous culture shock she experienced. The following year, she changed schools. Being one of the only Latine kids at the school, she felt isolated not only culturally, but also linguistically because she did not speak English. Napa then and now, is a town of tremendous economic disparity between the vineyard owners and the farmworkers who tend their vines, and Yatziry's elementary school was no exception to this socioeconomic chasm. Though both of her parents worked all of the time, they were paid very low wages, and so money was tight. Yatziry remembers having very few clothes, and the ones she did have were ill-fitting. This feeling of being an outsider in a foreign land continued on until her freshman year of high school when Yatziry slowly began to feel at home in Napa. Yatziry attests that a key person in this best friend, Marisol. Though Marisol had moved away from Napa when they were in elementary school, Yatziry was thrilled to see Marisol challenges of being bicultural, in a town that was monocultural, monolingual and expensive. Yatziry's confidence and sense to one thing became very clear to her\u2014if she wanted to break free from the harsh economic realities that her hardworking family faced, she needed to go to college. The DREAMER A dedicated student, Yatziry was excited to begin the process of applying for college her senior year of high school. She was devastated to find out from her college counselor and teachers that her dream of going to a four-year institution was not possible because she was undocumented. Despite door after door closing on her goal of going to college, she remained resolute to pursue higher education. She then found a new scholarship called TheDream.US inspired by the DREAM Act that would cover the costs of attending college. Yatziry shared that she was the first student to receive this scholarship at Sonoma State University, which inspired her to work at the school's Dream Center, and as a student ambassador where and finance higher education. Yatziry completed her first two years at Napa Valley College and then was able to transfer to Sonoma State, where she graduated with a B.S. in Business Administration with Cum Laude Honors. During her time at Sonoma State, Yatziry was awarded both a national and state fellowship. She continued her work empowering other undocumented smiled as she admitted that she made all of her younger family members take the AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) course in high school, which helps prepare students for college and their careers. Reflecting on her youth, Yatziry shared, \"The struggles that my family and I faced, both economically and because of the language barrier really motivated me to help others in my community that might be facing some of the same challenges. My hope is to be that helping hand that I needed growing up.\" Yatziry's Yatziry shared that she recently embarked on this journey this year when she decided to prioritize her mental health. She realized that after a lifetime of trauma, struggle and challenging familial dynamics, it was time to prioritize her own wellbeing, and so she booked her first trip to Maui. There she participated in a profoundly healing retreat based utilized when she was a child began to come back. Yatziry shared, \"I think that herbal medicine has come into my life to reconnect with myself, with my roots, my ancestors, madretierra (mother earth) and to my community as well. Being a part of The Botanical Bus has brought me deep healing and it is so incredibly rewarding to be able to help create a bilingual, bicultural space where our community can come to nurture each other.\" Recalling her birth story, Yatziry said that she owes her life to herbalism. Her mother had gone into labor when she was only seven months pregnant, and they lived over three hours away from the nearest hospital. While experiencing contractions, her mother hobbled onto the bus for the long ride to Jamiltepec, Oaxaca. When she arrived, all of the beds were full, and so she had to wait on the floor until a bed opened up for her delivery. Yatziry was moved to an incubator, but there was nowhere for her mother to stay so she continued to sleep on the floor after having just given birth. Eventually, her mother needed to return to heal herself as well, so took Yatziry home, Yatziry's grandmother told her they used (remedies and recipes) to to health. the exact contents of those herbal remedies, and so her new goal is to spend more time with her grandmother, and write down her remedios y recetas. Thankfully, Yatziry's grandmother was able to move to the US a few years ago, and so Yatziry tries to see her every week. As The Botanical Bus's Clinic Coordinator, Yatziry works directly and Wellness Workshops, as well as participate in our Promotora Training Program. She has been able to develop friendships with the Promotoras, who have been seminal in her herbalism education. At a recent Wellness Workshop Yatziry co-facilitated with Lulu P\u00e9rez, she found herself drawn to Salvia (Sage). As Lulu and her discussed the healing properties of designed beak sweet nectar. Yatziry paused mid-sentence to marvel at not only this Joyavoladora (hummingbird or translated literally this creature with an enormous heart this moment: her grandmother adores hummingbirds.

En el condado de Sonoma, los residentes latine constituyen 1/3 de la poblaci\u00f3n y casi el 80% de las infecciones por COVID-19. Nuestros trabajadores agr\u00edcolas, dom\u00e9sticos y jornaleros m\u00e1s vulnerables se enfrentan a condiciones de vivienda abarrotada, entornos laborales inseguros y acceso limitado a asistencia financiera y atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica.

Last week we gathered online in our separate homes to learn about \"La Cosecha\", the harvest of medicinal herbs, from promotora de salud, Maria de Lourdes P\u00e9rez Centuri\u00f3n. The workshop brought us together on Zoom, 15 live square computer screens merged while some sipped their coffee, some prepared food workdays ahead. Meeting people where-they-are-at has been at the heart of our work since the foundation of our mobile clinic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, meeting people online in their kitchens, parked cars, and workplaces has ironically brought us closer to this commitment. The power of this new connectivity was made very clear in our La Cosecha workshop. Participants joined us from Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico and Cuidad de Mexico, San Francisco, California and all corners of Sonoma County. Our international workshop, originally scheduled for one hour, turned into three hours. We discussed the phases of the moon, the movement of water inside plants and ultimately the movement of water or life force inside all of us. We were moved to tears as we shared traumas and looked to each other for affirmation of our collective strength as women and mothers. We found ourselves in the \"same room\", a group of BIPOC and Latine women of all ages, creating a safe place to explore our power, our boundaries and opportunities for self-care. Our connection to the earth, plants and each other remains strong. While we look forward to reconnecting in person, we are moved by the of our Latine community. Una Historia de Resiliencia Latine: Conexi\u00f3n Durante COVID-19 La semana pasada nos reunimos en l\u00ednea en nuestras casas separadas para aprender sobre la cosecha de hierbas medicinales, de la promotora de salud, Mar\u00eda de Lourdes P\u00e9rez Centuri\u00f3n. El taller nos reuni\u00f3 en Zoom, 15 pantallas de computadora cuadradas en vivo se fusionaron mientras algunos beb\u00edan su caf\u00e9, algunos preparaban comida para sus familias y otros preparaban para los ajetreados d\u00edas de trabajo que se avecinaban. Conocer a las personas donde se encuentran ha sido el n\u00facleo de nuestro trabajo desde la fundaci\u00f3n de nuestra cl\u00ednica m\u00f3vil. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, conocer gente en l\u00ednea en sus cocinas, autom\u00f3viles estacionados y lugares de trabajo, ir\u00f3nicamente, nos ha acercado m\u00e1s a este compromiso. El poder de esta nueva conectividad qued\u00f3 muy claro en nuestro taller de La Cosecha. Los participantes se unieron a nosotros desde Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico y Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, San Francisco, California y todos los rincones del condado de Sonoma. Nuestro taller internacional, originalmente programado para una hora, se convirti\u00f3 en tres horas. Hablamos de las fases de la luna, el movimiento del agua dentro de las plantas y, en \u00faltima instancia, el movimiento del agua o la fuerza vital dentro de todos nosotros. Nos emocionamos hasta las l\u00e1grimas cuando compartimos traumas y nos miramos mutuamente en busca de la afirmaci\u00f3n de nuestra fuerza colectiva como mujeres y madres. Nos encontramos en la \"misma habitaci\u00f3n\", un grupo de mujeres BIPOC y Latine de todas las edades, creando un lugar seguro para explorar nuestro poder, nuestros l\u00edmites y oportunidades para el cuidado personal. Nuestra conexi\u00f3n con la tierra, las plantas y entre nosotros sigue siendo fuerte. Si bien esperamos volver a conectarnos en persona, nos conmueve la capacidad de resiliencia de nuestra comunidad Latine. Promotora (pro-mo-tor-a): community health worker who is rising up to lead, advocate, educate, mentor, and translate health programming in shelter-in-place potted plants, our team of Promotoras gathered in the fields for a healing harvest. Under the wide-open skies at Tara Firma farm with Mandalion Designs we knelt together in chamomile, tulsi and yarrow. Lulu called us together to give thanks to the four directions and offer our thanks in her salve...highly valued by her friends and family) to share. From between the rows we gathered Omega rich Purslane, while Norma shared her recipes for steaming the wild greens in salsa verde. Close to the earth: the smell of the sweet herbs, the scratchy summer grass, the sounds of blackbirds gathering to drive off a hawk were the real medicine. We are honored to bring together this powerful group of women who heal with plants. All of our upcoming workshops will be led by Promotoras! \u00a1S\u00ed se puede!

Jose and Mercedes, who live around the corner, come everyday with their son to water. At midday, we moved into the shade to exchange recipes and remedies for Type II Diabetes, a chronic disease that affects 11% of Latinos in Sonoma County. We focused on recent studies that show the correlation between stress and blood scrawling cycles of insulin and family nopales asados (grilled cactus), verdolagas chile verde (purslane in tomatillo salsa), and tomatillo salsa with raw garlic . Nopales, verdolagas, and raw garlic are traditionally used in Mexico to reduce blood sugar levels in type II diabetics. We shared a potluck lunch of frijoles a la olla (beans from the pot), kale salad from the garden, watermelon and te de jamaica sweetened with local honey. Over lunch we shared our stories of overcoming health challenges such as recovery, a her process of realization that a traumatic event in her early to recent life threatening There is powerful healing in this opportunity to share our stories and our paths to recovery. We are so thankful for the open hearts and hardworking hands of the community gardeners and herbalists that are coming together for the Botanical Bus wellness workshops at Corazon Healdsburg!
