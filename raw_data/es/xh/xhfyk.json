Highlights of today's episode include: The often our first experiences with human contact. In an ideal setting, they are there to nurture and protect us. What happens when that dynamic is twisted into a power struggle? In today's episode, we examine common signs of dysfunction and ways to put yourself on the path to healing and taking back your power. These tips can apply to just about any toxic relationship, but we are specifically talking about toxic parents. CommonSigns: Belittling or devaluing - You accomplishments are never good enough. Competition - Parents pit themselves against their own children or love prospects. Caution is fine, but this goes to the point of preventing their children from having normal, healthy lives. Keeping you at a \"safe\" age - By \"safe,\" I mean they want to keep you in a child-like dependent state. It's easier for them to control you as a five-year old rather than as a thirty-year old. Gaslighting - deny your experience by telling you what you're supposed to want or like saying like, \"That's not the career you want.\" Unless it's true, then they are gaslighting you. It also comes in the form of denying they said or did the things they actually said or did to make you question your reality. Refusing to admit wrongdoing - This one speaks for itself. Somehow no matter how culpable they are, they will turn the blame back on you. Projecting - If they accuse you of anything, it may be a sign that they themselves are guilty of that very thing. If they accuse you of being ungrateful, it means they are ungrateful. If they accuse you of lying, chances are that they are the ones lying. This is not an exhaustive list by any means but are some behaviors to watch out for. If you are a victim of toxic or narcissistic parents, I wish you peace in finding a way past the hurt feelings.
