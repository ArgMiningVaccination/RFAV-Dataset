its first reported HIV/AIDS case, Argentina has become the country with the second lowest HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality in South America. Furthermore, the incidence of HIV in Argentina decreased by 25 percent from 2001 to 2011. This book describes and examines what lies behind this success. The authors reveal that universal access to treatment with financial protection for the poorest, continuous advances in the legal framework to reduce stigma and improve human rights, and innovations in the quality and service delivery of the HIV/AIDS health care service line have all been key contributors in this regard. Over the past 30 years, Argentina has tackled the HIV/AIDS epidemic from including sexual and health education nationwide and massive media campaigns. And it fundamentally changed the health service model for HIV/AIDS patients in the logistics of supplies and condoms, an and results-based services. Surveys of health have improved the health delivery model and identified bottlenecks in access and coverage. During these years, the World Bank has supported the HIV/AIDS National Program and accompanied the government's efforts through financing tech-nical support. this the authors good that can be replicated in strengthen ownership, ensure resource details how key programmatic innovations in Argentina have resulted not only in more than US$700 million in savings for the country between 2001 and 2010, but also, most important, the prevention of more than 230,000 disability-adjusted life years between 2001 and 2011. xiv Foreword Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Despite these successes, the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic still key challenges, rates between program, considering the increasing number of patients in treatment and the high com-parative cost of antiretroviral treatment. Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina provides a summary to control the HIV/AIDS epidemic and is an ana-lytical piece that could be used by Argentina and other countries to continue improving and innovating responses to is a contribution to the long-standing partnership in public health between Argentina and the World Bank that seeks to improve the well-being of the Argentine population.

In the 1990s, Argentina was greatly impacted by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This report details the past 30 years of the country's efforts to combat the epidemic. HIV/AIDS of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. HIV cases increased from 1,000 in 1990 to 4,223 in 1997, and peaked at more than 6,700 new infections per year in 2004 (National Ministry of Health [ MSN] 2013 ). This amounts to 18.5 persons becoming infected per day in 2004. In 2013, there were around 110,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in the country, that is, one in every 365 people, and there were around 5,500 new HIV cases every year, or 15 new infections per day. Comparing 2004 with 2013, there was a reduc-tion of 3.5 persons becoming infected daily. In 2011, the HIV incidence rate was 12 per 100,000 people and the incidence rate of AIDS cases was 3.6 per 100,000 people (4,915 new HIV infections and 1,454 cases of AIDS). Between 2000 and 2010, the HIV incidence rate decreased in Argentina by 25 percent (cases identified). There was a decline in the number of new infections among most age and sex groups in the population, most of new infections, this age group is still responsible for the largest number of new HIV cases. During 2000-10, there was an increase in the number of new cases in men ages 15-24. This increase in new cases in young males may be responsible for the further \"masculinization\" of the epidemic in Argentina, with the male-to-female ratio increasing from 1.8 in 2001 to 2.0 in 2011. In the City of Buenos Aires, 2 Executive Summary Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7incidence rates decreased from 40.6 per inhabitants in 2001 to 23.9 per 100,000 in 2011; in the province of Buenos Aires, incidence rates decreased from 21 to 9.9 per 100,000 in the same time frame. Although the trend of decline is positive, the incidence rate in the City of Buenos Aires is double that in all other regions. Although there are still 100 mother-to-child transmitted infections each Argentina has reduced the vertical transmission rate from 13.7 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 5.2 in 2011, a reduction of almost 62 percent. Multipronged efforts involving high prenatal care and delivery for seropositive women, emphasis on HIV testing of pregnant women, higher coverage of prophylactic treatment, and the creation of a surveillance system to track seropositive pregnant women have contrib-uted to progress against HIV/AIDS. A key lesson learned came from the strategic alliance with the Sexual and Reproductive Public Health and Blood Programs for increasing the access of mothers and children to heath care. Between, 2009 and 2010, 47 percent of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS-positive women were whom seven percent had a late diagnosis during labor or immediately after labor. These diagnoses show the need for improvement in early testing of pregnant women to detect HIV cases, and health provision for pregnant women as a means to stop vertical transmission of HIV. Between 2000 and 2010, the burden of HIV/AIDS decreased by 21.2 percent in Argentina, which the largest percentage decrease in South America during that timeframe. This reduction shows that it is possible to further reduce the HIV/AIDS burden even when a country has already achieved a relatively low burden of HIV, as was the case in Argentina. The country had only 2.9 percent of the total regional HIV/AIDS disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) or burden of disease in 2010. By contrast, Colombia, a country with a similar GDP and population the lowest HIV/AIDS burden in South America, after Chile ( MSN ). However, while Chile showed a 28 percent increase in HIV/AIDS burden from to reduction in LAC during the same period of time (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [IHME] 2013; MSN 2013 ). In 2010, the HIV/AIDS in Argentina was 223 DALYs per 100,000, less than half the regional average of HIV/AIDS 100,000 ( IHME 2013 ). Despite the exponential growth of new HIV cases from 1990 to 1997, early financial coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ART) beginning in 1997 has been essential in keeping the number of AIDS Argentina built a robust National HIV/AIDS Program. Since the creation of the program in 1995, key innovations have contributed to the reduction of the HIV/AIDS burden. Executive Summary 3 Thirty Argentina's innovations in Argentina: (a) the of free ART since 1997; (b) a com- prehensive legal framework for sexual and reproductive rights; (c) a new sex education program in schools; (d) strategic alliances between key health for findings from supply-side surveys in health monitoring and medicines for and electronic clinical governance for improv-ing the quality of below. HIV/AIDS treatment is a key prevention intervention. Argentina and Brazil have shown that universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment is key to reducing the HIV/AIDS burden. Argentina nearly achieved universal cov-erage in 2012, with 79 percent coverage (universal coverage is defined by the World Health Organization [WHO] as over 80 percent ART coverage; Pan American Health Organization [PAHO] 2013). Both countries made HIV/AIDS treatment a public good, providing free access to all those in need. 2. A comprehensive legal framework for sexual and reproductive rights reduces stigma and discrimination. In 1995, Argentina's Law 24455 guaranteed universal access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment. In 1997, the country introduced the free provision of ART, regardless of income or health insurance status, guaranteeing the financial protec-tion of HIV/AIDS treatment for all. This legal framework became vital for reducing new HIV infections and AIDS deaths. In 2002, mandated that health providers and facilities offer HIV to pregnant women. The law also mandated financial coverage of testing, becoming a key for the prevention of vertical transmission. Also in 2002, the law on Sexual Health and Responsible Parenthood (Law 25673) mandated in primary health care centers and public hospitals. In 2006, another law (26150) established the creation of the National Comprehensive Sexual Education Program, which is part of federal and state school curricula across the country and seeks to expand knowledge on safe Marriage Equality Law (26618) recognized unions between persons of the same sex. Most in 2012, the Gender Identity Law in country (34 percent HIV prevalence among 4 Executive Summary Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7transgender people in Argentina), to change their gender ( MSN 2013 ). These laws create a legal framework to reduce the stigma that prevents diverse popula-tions from accessing health education in schools improves prevention knowledge among youth. Since the 2006 passage of Law 26150, Argentina has implemented a new sexual health education program in all public schools. Argentine youth have the highest knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention in the region, with 84 percent of young men and 89 percent of young women (ages 15-24) accu-rately identifying prevention methods and major misconceptions about HIV transmission, followed by Chile with 78 and 85 percent of young men and women, respectively (PAHO 2010). 4. Strategic alliances in service delivery can help reduce mother-to-child transmission. From 2009 to 2010, 47 percent of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS-positive women were identified in the context of pregnancy, underlining the need for early HIV testing among women of all ages. Argentina has reduced its mother-to-child transmission rate by 62 percent, from 13.7 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 5.2 in 2011. This success was possible thanks to the following: (a) a strategic alliance with the safe blood program, creating a comprehensive system sexually transmitted diseases, and other diseases, and (b) a strategic alliance with the public health surveillance system for the creation of epidemiological monitoring of health events of seropositive preg-nant women Program overall system account- ability and improved program performance (PAHO 2010). Under the Essential Public Health Functions Project (EPHFP), a package of guaranteed public health services was created with the use of RBF in six public health for the programs, intermediate results were identified as outputs. In the case of the National HIV/AIDS Program, a third-party external auditor verified the completion of six outputs prior to authorizing payments to provinces. The use of RBF has since been expanded, and the use of outputs has been consolidated throughout the country. 6. National supply-side Argentina conducted two 2011) Executive Summary of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic Argentina inform the national provinces reported an improvement in the supply of and access to preventive, diagnostic, and health care services for people living with HIV/AIDS from 2007 to 2011. 7. Online monitoring systems can eliminate duplication and boost efficiency. In 2009, the Ministry of Health introduced an online monitoring system that tracks the use and distribution of HIV/AIDS supplies. The system was designed with support loss also supported the National HIV/AIDS Program in the development and implementation of a patient case-management system. The system allows online requests for authorizations, monitoring of patients' viral load and other tests, as well as monitoring of drug regimen and treatment protocols. The case-management software, which was introduced in 2011, allows for assessment of treatment quality and adherence and resistance to treatment. All provinces are linked into the system, which, by the end of 2012, included more than 30,000 patients (PAHO 2010). The HIV monitoring system for patients has increased the efficiency of prescription and delivery of ART, as well as patient follow-up. The Cost of HIV/AIDS in Argentina Economic Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program HIV/AIDS expenditures per DALY in Argentina were the third highest in the region after Cuba and Chile in 2009-11. While the average HIV/AIDS expendi-ture per DALY in LAC between 2009 and 2011 was US$1,052, in Argentina it was three times higher, at US$3,178. Argentina's total domestic HIV spending was US$285.95 million in 2012 and US$287.1 million in 2009. The country also has the second highest spending per person living with HIV/AIDS in the region, after Barbados. Argentina currently spends US$3,178 per DALY of HIV/AIDS, almost three times regional average of US$1,052 (UNAIDS 2012). A cross-country comparison of HIV spending finds that Argentina has one of the lowest burdens of HIV in the region and is one of the highest spenders per DALY. However, the results are not as clear when looking at countries in the world with a similar HIV/AIDS burden: some countries spend more than Argentina and have more DALYs per 100,000; others spend a significant reduction in HIV/AIDS burden from 2000 to 2010, while having a relatively low HIV/AIDS burden in 2010. 6 Executive Summary Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Sustainability From percent, reaching 0.25 percent of total spending in Argentina by 2009. In 2012, external funding was showing expenditures in Africa and 13 percent in LAC. Argentina has a similar allocation of HIV funds compared with the LAC average for treatment and prevention, where treatment and care represented 80 percent of total HIV spending in 2012 (75 percent in LAC). The difference is partially explained by the higher cost of ART in Argentina, which means that Argentina can allocate less to Ar\u00e1n-Matero et al. 2011 ). Despite the high cost of ART, this study shows that the Argentine National HIV/AIDS Program is cost beneficial, with an estimated 1.03 benefit-to-cost ratio (chapter 7). Lives Saved and Universal Access to Treatment Our estimations indicate that, during the past decade, 2,258 saved the most conservative scenario, and were saved under the most likely epidemiological scenario. Over the 10 years analyzed, the 4,379 potential lives saved under the most probable scenario (approximately 440 lives per year) are a direct consequence of the measures implemented as part of the National Program for combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The cases of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico show that universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment and high coverage of ART are key measures for reducing the HIV/AIDS burden. Argentina had 79 percent ART coverage 2012. In the three mentioned countries, national HIV/AIDS programs made ART a public good, providing free and universal access to all without distinction. Currently, the challenge for all countries, and specifically for Argentina, is to reach a new standard in treatment, under the new goals defined by WHO and PAHO to have 90 coverage (PAHO halting the spread of HIV, including but not limited to the following, which are described in detail in the number of new infections among young men who have sex with men, while most other groups show marked reductions (chapters 1 provinces the Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7\u0081 Insufficient coverage of HIV tuberculosis patients (chapter 4) \u0081 Governance issues in health service delivery (service networks, human resources, training, budget) (chapters 1 and 4) \u0081 expenditure on HIV 6) Spending and Resource Allocation to HIV Programs and Services in Latin America and the Caribbean .\" PLoS One 6 (7) : e22373 .

In 1992, Argentina introduced a national program to reduce the HIV/AIDS epidemic and disease burden ( Lara and Since 1996, the MSN has implemented HIV/AIDS treatment as a public good, guaranteeing free and universal access for all citizens. The country implemented a comprehensive set of service delivery solutions that include free and universal access to treatment, social communication campaigns to promote the distribution and use of con-doms, health education on sexual and reproductive rights, systems to monitor patients, online supply and medicine tracking systems, and social mobilization and consensus building to create new legal frameworks and reduce stigma and discrimination. Over the past five years, efforts have been focused on improving health surveillance systems and a new, results-based financing (RBF) for preventive and acute health care services and key essential public health 10 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7functions. All these efforts have brought improvements to the quality of life and life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS, so that having HIV/AIDS in Argentina currently means we analyze the epidemiological situation of HIV/AIDS in Argentina and the sequence of key decisions implemented over the years, which led to the sustained reduction in the country's HIV/AIDS burden. In addition, we continuous legal framework that has accompanied Argentina's National HIV/AIDS Program and some of provides on HIV/AIDS Epidemic during the Past Two Decades In 2013, there were around 110,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in Argentina, meaning that one in every 365 persons is infected with HIV. The HIV incidence across age groups has remained stable, with 4.8 of every 1,000 young people and adults (ages 15-49 years) infected with HIV in Argentina ( United Nations 2012 ; MSN 2013 ). In 2013, around 30 percent of infected people were unaware of their status, which represents a 40 percent reduction from 2011 ( MSN 2011 ). There are around 5,500 new HIV cases every year, which is 15 new infections per day, for a total of 66,657 new HIV cases between 2001 and 2012 ( MSN 2013 ). The incidence rate of AIDS has been declining since 1997 and incidence of HIV has been declining since 2004. In 2011, the HIV incidence rate was 12 per 100,000 people and the incidence rate of AIDS cases was 3.6 per 100,000 people (4,915 new HIV infections and 1,454 cases of AIDS in recent years) ( MSN 2013 ) ( figures 1.1 and 1.2) . As is the case in the majority of middle-income countries, HIV/AIDS in Argentina is concentrated in large cities. The provinces with the most HIV cases reported from 2001 to 2012 were Buenos Aires, with 42.8 percent of the cases, followed by the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (the federal capital), with 16.7 percent; C\u00f3rdoba, with 7.9 percent; and Santa Fe, with 5.5 percent (MSN 2013). These four provinces accounted for 72.9 percent of the accumulated HIV cases over the past decade, while the other 20 provinces together accounted for the remaining 25 percent of the diagnosed HIV cases. Nonetheless, the province of Buenos Aires, the City of Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe were the only localities to show decreases in HIV/AIDS from 2001 to 2011 (52.86, 41.13, percent decreases, respectively), while most remained stable Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina 11 Thirty Years of the in Argentina burden HIV/AIDS are detailed in chapter 3. National HIV rates have been on the decline over the past decade, espe- cially among women. The HIV rate among men decreased from 20.9 per 100,000 in 2001 to 16.4 per 100,000 in 2011 (a 21.5 percent rate of decline), while the HIV rate among women decreased from 11 per 100,000 in 2001 to Figure 1.1 AIDS Cases and HIV Incidence in Argentina, 1991-2011 Per 100,000 people 199005101520HIV/AIDS cases per 100,000 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 HIV cases AIDS cases S o u r c e : MSN 2013 .

There was also a reduction in the number of cases across all age groups, with the exception of young men (ages 15-24), a group that presented a net increase. The reduction in the number of new cases among the population under age 15 years is related to improvements in PMTCT, which is described in detail in the subsection on vertical transmission of HIV. The HIV incidence rate shows similar results ( of male-to-female HIV infections increased slightly from 1.8 in 2001 to 2 in 2011.

In June 2001, the United Nations Special Assembly on HIV/AIDS set targets to reduce the number of new HIV infections among children by 20 and 50 percent by the years 2005 and 2010, respectively ( policies, guidelines, and integrated service delivery in the health delivery model to ensure full access to the necessary range of services, including sexual and reproductive health care; antenatal care; and HIV and syphilis testing, treatment, and ( Pan American Health Organization [PAHO] 2010b ). According to PAHO and WHO, LAC is on track in implementing strategies or plans of action in support and presenting up-to-date as well as up-to-date guidelines for the Elimination Initiative. In addition, Argentina has created partnerships between the National HIV/AIDS Program and the National Maternal and Child Health Program to increase screening, surveillance, and early treatment of HIV-positive mothers and their children, as well as universal and free access to milk formula for children of infected mothers. Although there are still 100 mother-to-child transmission infections each year (MSN 2013), Argentina has reduced the vertical transmission rate from 13.7 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 5.2 in 2011, a 100,000 people 1990012345678910 AIDS deaths per 100,000 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Men Women S o u r c e : MSN 2013.

More than two-thirds (69 percent) the TB cases occurred in South America, 14 percent in the Caribbean, 12 percent in Mexico and Central America, and 5.5 percent in North America. The total TB incidence rate is 28.6 per 100,000 people. In 2010, there were an estimated 334,000 TB cases in the Argentina and Brazil have led the way in universal and free access to ART provi- sion since 1995 and 1996, respectively. For people with advanced HIV infections, both governments have prioritized ART through the public health system. In Argentina, Law 24455, passed in 1995, guarantees universal access to HIV/AIDS provision of medical, psychological, and pharma-ceutical therapy ( Bianco and others 1998 ). In Brazil, free and universal provision of ART thorough the public health system was mandated by the 1996 Law 9313 ( UNAIDS 2013 ).

Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina 23 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 In 2011, LAC had higher coverage of ART than the global average (68 percent in Latin America, 67 percent in the Caribbean, 54 percent globally). Since highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) became available to treat HIV in the late 1990s, there has been wide and impressive distribution of this treatment across the region. Nonetheless, disparities in access to treatment remain across the region. On average, ART is more accessible in South America than in Central America. And while some countries have reached more than 80 percent treatment coverage (Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico), others have achieved more than 60 percent coverage (Argentina with 79 percent, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Peru, and Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela). Some countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras, and Uruguay) have yet to reach of total HIV spending in LAC between 2009 and 2011 was spent on ART ( PAHO 2013 ), nearly one-third of people received treatment. Bolivia has the lowest ART coverage in the region, with a 15 percent coverage rate in 2011. Although the supply of ART has improved in the region over the past few years, in 2012 45 percent of LAC countries still reported at least one episode of ART being 2013 ).

This national policy articulates systems of functions, activities, actors, resources, and information flows that are in constant interaction. Programmatic Structure epidemic have evolved\u2014accompanied by new knowledge and treatment options\u2014since the mid-1980s, when diagnostic tests were the only resource available. Argentina and Brazil were pioneers in the introduction of comprehensive and universal HIV/AIDS programs reducing the spread and burden of the epidemic, including universal and free access to health care for people living with HIV/AIDS. From 1983 to 1989, MSN started the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by incorporating HIV/AIDS the agenda of the STDs Department and creating the National Register of HIV/AIDS. 1990, the Argentine government declared the fight against AIDS to be a matter of national interest with the adoption of National AIDS Law 23798, which holds the Ministry of Health and Social Action as the responsible authority. The 1991 promulgation of this law by and Hofbauer In 1992, as a result of Law 23798 ( Lara and Hofbauer 2004 ), the National Control Program of Human Retroviruses (Leukemia and AIDS) was created under MSN. Until 1997, the program functioned with a structure based on two main pillars of activities: diagnosis and care of infected patients and distribution of drugs. The program includes medical assistance, viral load testing, reagents for blood banks, epidemiological and dissemination of information. It also free and anonymous telephone line, Dial Health/Ask AIDS, aimed at 24455 passed in 1995. guarantees universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment, including the provision of medical, psycho-logical, and pharmaceutical therapy ( Bianco and others 1998 ). Law 24455 defined treatment and care as a public good for the entire affected population regardless of individual differences in health insurance and coverage. Under the law, the social security system must provide free treatment for its affiliates (provincial and municipal Obras Sociales from the social security system), as they are not ruled by the same legal framework as public facilities ( Bianco and others 1998 ). Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina 25 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 In 1996, the Supreme Court ruled that all private medical insurance schemes were obliged to provide free treatment and Law 24754. MSN also approved the Obligatory Medical Program for Social Medical Security, which included complete coverage of treatment and medicines for people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, the Supreme made treatment, making HIV/AIDS care and prevention an obligation of the state (Bianco and others 1998). In 1997, the provisions of this law became appli-cable to private medical insurance ( Bianco and others 1998 ). Since 1996, the provision of ARVs has been managed by MSN ( Lara and Hofbauer 2004 ). In 1997, by virtue Resolution 346, MSN changed the HIV/ AIDS medicine purchase and distribution system, making it the responsibility of the National Department of Services Regulations in the sub-secretariat of Medical Treatment. This resolution defines the responsibilities of the National HIV/AIDS assessment necessities, in jurisdictions. resolution the distribution of medicines through the signing of agreements between MSN and the provincial ministries, in which MSN commits to providing ART to cases province. These agreements delineate and the provinces, although according to the AIDS law, the main responsibility still rests with MSN ( Bianco and others 1998 Transmitted agreement for US$15 million signed with the World Bank and managed by MSN ( Gobierno de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina 1999 ). LUSIDA's main objective was to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS through a permanent program aimed at the prevention of and with the greatest number of registered cases: the City of Buenos Aires, the province of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and C\u00f3rdoba. LUSIDA was designed to function collaboratively with the existing and integrates five elements ( Lara and Hofbauer 2004 ): (a) a fund to provide economic support to the prevention programs of civil society organizations that and educa-tion; strengthening of governmental health sector dedicated to AIDS; and (e) evaluation and monitoring. LUSIDA a development impact on the AIDS epidemic in Argentina, mostly through support for the prevention of vertical transmission, the development of an HIV/AIDS surveillance system, and the implementation of the country's 2001 crisis and ( World Bank 2004 ). Among notable activities developed by the project is its support of the HIV/AIDS 26 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 prevention programs of ). also basic maternal expansions of immuniza-tions and TB programs, PMTCT of HIV, operation of blood banks, and support of the National HIV/AIDS Program (focusing on procurement of medicine) ( MSN 2004 ). In 1998, the National HIV/AIDS Program realized the need for a strategic plan to coordinate the growth of the AIDS response at the national and local levels. To this end, there were efforts to create a national decentralized planning network to 2004 At the national level, execution falls under the Coordination and Execution Unit. MSN purchases patients. Similarly, MSN authorizes and supplies virus load tests for all people being cared for by the public health system ( Lara and Hofbauer 2004 ). In 1999, Argentina signed an agreement with the World Bank for a loan in the amount of US$52.5 million surveillance sys-tem and support disease prevention and control. The main areas of action include training human resources, hiring staff to work in national and provincial epide-miology units, developing software systems for epidemiological surveillance, strengthening laboratories, and and Programs Project (FESP) (US$220 million) was approved to support the Federal Health Plan and the reduction of mortality and morbidity associated with communicable diseases. The three main objectives of the project were to (a) increase the coverage of 10 prioritized health programs, including HIV/AIDS; (b) reduce the population's supply-side National HIV/AIDS Program in health facilities in and (c) improve stewardship role and Among the many project results, was an increase the number of HIV/AIDS tests and systems for increasing efficiency of prescriptions of RBF and output-based disbursements, were included in the design. FESP II (US$460 million) was 2011 second survey of HIV/AIDS in health facilities in 2013 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina 27 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7(supply side) and the second risk factors survey (demand side). With the sup- port of FESP II and FESP I, over the past three years Argentina's MSN inno-vated the National HIV/AIDS Program by adding two service solutions: (a) an online monitoring system that tracks efficient use and distribution of HIV/AIDS medicines and supplies, and health care services ( World Bank 2004 ). These outputs are defined strategically to achieve results and increase accountability between are allocated to subnational levels and providers only have by external prevention and care of HIV/AIDS and other STIs at the national level. The department also plays a role in coordinating actions with provincial, territorial, programs; civil society actors; and international organizations. DSyETS's guiding principle is access to services and strengthening of the popula-tion. In particular, DSyETS works to provide comprehensive care for people with HIV/AIDS, promote condom use and testing with counseling, and reduce discrimination in the health system and society as a whole ( MSN 2014 ). Because of the country's federal structure, the provincial ministries health are responsible for coordinating the response to There are programs, 12 regional AIDS programs in the province of Buenos Aires, and 26 municipal programs. Differences are apparent in the management of resources. health authorities in each jurisdiction must develop AIDS, manage resources for funding and implementation, promote human resources training, and foster the development of research activities. In practice, tasks are jointly distributed. MSN's role, through purchase and supply drugs, (b) authorize and fund viral load tests, (c) purchase and distribute reagents for blood banks and tests for women, (d) purchase reagents for the enzyme-linked count (CD4 and CD8) studies for jurisdictions that request them (since 2003), and (i) manage the records of infected patients. The provincial jurisdictions should costs of medicines and reagents acquired by MSN from the capital to the respec-tive jurisdiction, (b) sending viral load tests to the (c) studies of lymphocyte counts or costs of sending them to laboratories (offered by MSN since 2003), (d) purchase and financing of reagents to test the general population (outside blood banks), (e) purchase and provision of milk formula for babies of HIV-positive and centers), public health activities in their jurisdictions. 28 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina Thirty Years of 2001, it became mandatory to notify the health system of all new HIV diagnoses ( figure 1.18) . for better understanding and management of the epidemic use of monitor high-risk groups, in addition to systematic data collection and analysis ( WHO 2014 ). The main objective of epidemiological to improve the understanding of the HIV/AIDS situation at the national and subregional levels to define lines of work and establish priorities. Second-generation of surveillance groups, their risk health ( UNAIDS 2012 ). Moreover, since 2002, the rapid diagnostic HIV test has become available and free for all pregnant women in public and private facilities. Since 2008, 32 provincial situation rooms have been added to the surveillance system, reinforcing surveillance capacity and provincial health intelligence. Situation rooms include a group of three to four epidemiologists and economists connected to national on mother-to-child transmission. a. 2011 data were not finalized due to delays in notification.

The monitoring system can be used by physicians to authorize treatments, and it allows patients under treatment, provision of medicines, and connectivity the inputs monitoring system. makes the epicenter for control in Argentina. Recently, the government has implemented the use of rapid HIV testing to expand detection efforts. These and other services were evaluated by the Monitoring and Evaluation Study of the Current Status of the Preventive and Social Protection to HIV/AIDS, STIs and Viral Hepatitis in Argentina surveys, which are is responsible for defining and coordinating policies for pre-vention and control of HIV/AIDS and other STIs at the national level. DSyETS is also responsible for coordinating actions with provincial, munic-ipal civil society and international organizations. Access to guide care for with HIV/AIDS, promotes condom use and testing with counseling, and works to reduce discrimi-nation in the health system and society as a whole. DSyETS implements policies and strategies process of diversifica-tion of supply consisting of four main lines of work: 1.

In 2010, DSyETS distributed a monthly average of 3.7 million condoms, reaching a total of 44 million condoms during the year. It also increased the number of fixed points for condom distribution, with a large concentration in the province of Buenos Aires. Moreover, the program has developed a 0-800 telephone line for information about HIV/AIDS. 2.

The HIV epidemic requires renewed efforts to continue its reduc-tion. the number of new infections declined among most age and sex groups in the population, with the most visible decline among adults ages 25-34. despite the decline in number of new infections, this group is still responsible for the largest number of new HIV cases. In addition, there has been a small increase in new cases among adults ages 45 and older. With the introduction of HAART and other HIV/AIDS treatment options, people living Table 1.1 Essential Public Health Functions in the HIV/AIDS Program at the National and Subnational Levels (continued) Essential public health the quality of management.Hospitals and testing.Number people counseled and tested.Implementation of the plan for prevention and care for HIV/AIDS and STIs in penal levels; ensuring a experts.Training at Development u r c e : Authors' elaboration.

Despite the overall decline in HIV incidence in Argentina, there was an increase in the number of new cases among men ages 15-24, while the number of new cases among women of the same age group declined. This increase in new cases among young males is responsible for the further \"masculinization\" of the epidemic in Argentina, with the male-to-female ratio increasing from 1.8 in 2001 to 2.0 in 2011. It is interesting to note that this trend contradicts the global trend of feminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as is the case in many African coun-tries. Although PAHO reports that Argentine youth have the best knowledge of HIV prevention in Latin America, this knowledge is not being translated into prevention among young males. Given that 41.1 percent of new HIV infections among males between 2010 and 2012 occurred through same-sex intercourse, there is a need for renewed HIV prevention efforts that target young men who have sex with men. The increase in the diagnoses of men infected through sex with other men ( MSN 2013 ) shows the need to target HIV prevention and control efforts on the population of men who have sex with men. It is also vital to consider particular age groups, taking into account the mean age of diagnosis, which is 32 among women, 37 among men infected through heterosexual sex, and 31 for those infected through sex with other men ( MSN 2013 ). should also consider of which 65 percent have occurred in the central area of the country (including the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Gran Buenos Aires, and Central regions) ( MSN 2013 ). Notwithstanding the currently low mother-to-child HIV can be gleaned the prevention efforts. Argentina achieved a 62 percent reduction in vertical transmission from 2001 to 2011, a success that was only possible through multi-pronged efforts that involved high financial investment and improvement in prenatal care and delivery for seropositive women, emphasizing the need for HIV testing of pregnant women, higher cover-age of prophylactic treatment, and the creation of a surveillance system to track seropositive pregnant women. Successes in approach that targets multiple facets of the issue. As the HIV epi-demic in Argentina becomes ever more concentrated in selected populations, HIV prevention and treatment services must be incorporated into the public health system, as has been done with PMTCT, to ensure the quality and sustain-ability of these services. Recent changes in the epidemiology of HIV in Argentina must be considered in the context of national programs and policies that have been designed to halt and reverse the epidemic over the regulatory legal frame-work that supports Argentina's National HIV/AIDS Program relatively the epidemic has allowed the government to 34 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7stabilize and concentrate on groups with high-risk practices and low prevalence. Although Argentina has a system to provide services to people with HIV/AIDS, as well as universal access to the provision of goods and services for all citizens of the country, irrespective of insurance plans, public treatment coverage has stabilized at around 79 percent of all people receiving treatment, because of fragmentation and private agents providing services that differ from those pro-vided by the provincial governments. In spite of Argentina's concerted efforts, recent and continuous decline in the number of HIV Although access ser-vices remain, especially in rural areas. The high number of late diagnoses and cases of people with HIV shows that preventive actions are still insufficient. Moving forward, inequalities in and improve coordination between national and provincial plans. N o t e 1.

A recent Evaluation uses Global Burden of Study (GBD) data to analyze the global burden of HIV from 1990 to 2010 ( IHME 2013a ). Box disease (BoD). Although most of the global HIV burden falls on countries where HIV/AIDS is the first or second leading cause of death and disability, the data show an increasing burden on countries where HIV is not ranked in the top 10 causes of BoD. In 2005, for instance, countries where HIV ranked first or second carried the 15.5 percent of the burden in 2005, increasing to 20 percent in 2010. Although results, these data suggest that countries in which, similar to Argentina, HIV is not among the top causes of morbidity and through a comparative study of neighboring countries' experiences with HIV control. As such, this chapter will (a) introduce a description of the GBD approach, (b) situate the HIV epidemic in Argentina within the country's recent historical background, and (c) analyze the burden of HIV in Argentina compared with other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). 38 Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina: Global and Regional Comparative Analysis Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Global Burden comparative analysis HIV/AIDS burden in Argentina with similar coun- tries in LAC is conducted with data from the GBD and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ( [UNAIDS] 2012 ). The GBD scientific global assessment that quan- tifies the comparative magnitude of health lost to disease and injury. The GBD approach results from a worldwide collaboration between researchers and accounts for risk factors by time ( 2013a ). The guiding of the GBD is that the best estimates are generated by analyzing all available sources of information and then correcting for potential problems with the data. The GBD published by IHME, analyzes information for 291 causes, 20 age groups, and 187 countries, aggregating the data into regional and global esti-mates of BoD for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. The results are presented (DALYs), shows that is responsible for 0.84 percent of the total DALYs in Argentina in 2005 ( Borruel, Mas, and Borruel 2010 ). The analysis also that in men, HIV/AIDS DALYs account for of percent of the total YLDs, 1.06 percent in the case of men and 0.57 percent in the case of women. HIV/ Disease allows of years of life lost because of premature death and disability as a Disability-adjusted years the number years because of premature death and years lived with various types and severity of disabilities. Therefore, one DALY is one healthy year of life lost. To calculate a DALY for a given illness, one must estimate (a) the number of years lost and (b) the number of years lived with disability (YLDs) of specific two combined to obtain the DALYs for a given disease. Years of life lost (YLL) are calculated by subtracting the age at death from life expectancy at birth. YLDs are calculated from the beginning to the end of a disease. Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina: Global and Regional Comparative Analysis 39 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7AIDS was the fourth leading cause of disease burden in the communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders category, 1 which of total lost because of mortality and 2010. 35 to 85 years, with the highest burden among people ages 60 to 69 years. The main causes of death among men and women are cardiovascular disease and cancer, which represent a lowest in burden of HIV. Despite the low burden in 2000, the country has made progress in further reducing HIV/AIDS and Over past 20 years, the burden of HIV/AIDS has declined as a percentage of the burden of all diseases, at the expense of an from 1990 to 2010: HIV burden increased starting in 1990, peaked in 1995, followed by a decline beginning in 2000 with the introduction of antiretroviral treatment (ART), and stabilization around DALYs lost to HIV/AIDS. The YLD trend line remains stable Box 2.2 How Is a DALY Calculated? Murray (1994) first presents the technical basis to measure a disability-adjusted life year (DALY) by assessing the duration of time lost because of premature death. He then defines the social value of the time lived at different ages, which is calculated from an exponential function of the form Cxe x and the time are a rate using the time in each class is multiplied by the disability weight to make it comparable with the years lost because of premature mortality.

There was also a shift in the composition of DALYs by sex. Although there was a decrease in total YLLs to HIV for both sexes between 2000 and 2010, the decrease in DALYs among men (from 74,482 to 62,335) greater the decline DALYs among women (from 30,296 28,016). Consequently, in 2010 women made up 30.5 percent of the YLLs to HIV and men made up 69.5 percent of YLLs. The from HIV/AIDS in Argentina accounted for 0.7 percent of all deaths in 2000 and 0.58 percent in 2010. This reduction is explained by the decline in HIV incidence treatment deaths were percentage was 0.36 percent. The decrease in deaths from 2000 to 2010 was comparable for men and women, 10.5 percent for men and 14 percent for women (IHME 2013b). The burden of HIV by group decrease in HIV/AIDS DALYs among 80 percent of the BoD in 2010.

Nonetheless, there is a need to examine further the growing age gap in the burden between sexes. Among children younger than five years of age, there was around a 57 percent decline in the disease burden from 1995 to 2010, which coincides with the 1995 introduction of strategies to prevent vertical transmission of HIV in Argentina. In 2001, prenatal HIV testing became a mandatory part of prenatal care. In 2009, information on the births of HIV positive women was systematized. For males ages five to 14 years, there was a sustained decline and stabilization of the HIV BoD; among this age range, the trend is less clear. For ages 15-49 years, after a peak in 2000, there is a downward tendency in the burden in both sexes: BoD for men decreased by 30 percent in the past decade and 18 percent for women. The only age group that showed sustained growth in HIV BoD over time was ages 50-70 years. Between 1995 and 2010, their BoD increased by 39 percent among men and by among women, be a consequence of an evident increase in of persons living with HIV/AIDS ( figure 2.4) .

Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina: Global and Regional Comparative Analysis 43 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 From 2000 to 2010, the burden of HIV/AIDS increased by two from HIV/AIDS increased by 46 percent. In the LAC region as a whole, the story is different. Between 2000 and 2010, HIV/AIDS BoD, as measured per the number of DALYs per 100,000 people, decreased 22 percent, the number of HIV/AIDS-related deaths by 20 percent in the same period (IHME 2013b). The LAC region is very unequal and heterogeneous in terms of incidence, prevalence, access to treatment, and resource availability. Although the Caribbean is the second hardest hit region by HIV/AIDS in the world after Sub-Saharan Africa, many countries in LAC have stable epidemics with values around 0.4 percent of the total population. The past decade has seen a steady and significant decline in new infections in Latin America, from 93,000 in 2001 to approximately 83,000 in 2011. There has also been a decline in the number of people dying from AIDS-related causes, which declined by 10 percent between 2005 and 2011 (from 60,000 to 54,000). The Caribbean region has seen an even steeper reduction, of 42 percent, in new infections from 2001 to 2011 (from 22,000 to 13,000 new infections). Deaths caused by AIDS also declined from 20,000 in 2005 to 10,000 in 2011. However, adult prevalence in 2011 in the Caribbean was still around one percent, which is higher than any other region in the world outside Sub-Saharan Africa, making the Caribbean one of the regions most challenged by the HIV epidemic.

In the LAC region, the HIV prevalence rate among adults (ages 15-49 years) was around in 2011, which is a 17.2 percent decline since 2001. However, there are wide disparities between countries in the region, which has some of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS prevalence outside Sub-Saharan Africa (2.8 cases per 100 residents in the Bahamas) and one of the world's lowest rates (0.2 percent in 2011 almost half (47.3 percent) of the people living with HIV/AIDS in LAC are in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, the three largest countries in the region. Although Brazil has a relatively low HIV prevalence of 0.3 percent, 490,000 people live with HIV in that country. However, smaller countries, such as the Bahamas, Belize, Haiti, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, have the highest HIV prevalence in the region ( figure lower comparative 2012 concentrated in high-risk populations, mainly men who with injection drug users, and sex workers and their clients. in figure 2.5 , the majority the prevalence rate among vulnerable groups is as follows: 12 percent among men who have sex with ). Argentina is among the five countries in the region with the lowest notified AIDS cases among men, with rates four times lower than the incidence rate in the United States and nine times lower than the incidence rate in Brazil ( figure of men-to-women AIDS ratios, at 2.82, similar to rates in the United States and Canada (3.05 and five, Figure 2.5 HIV/AIDS the total adult population) S o u r c e : UNAIDS 2012 .

Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina: Global and Regional Comparative Analysis 47 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7exceptions arise in countries where ART was introduced in the late 1990s. Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay experienced a decrease in YLDs related to HIV/AIDS as a Argentina, although not showing absolute a very small increase in YLDs (10 percent). The data show the as for DALYs ( IHME 2000 were heterogeneous, as they are directly determined by the time of establishment, efficiency, and sustainability of the national programs to fight HIV/AIDS in different countries. In the LAC region, Mexico leads the reduction of burden during this period, decreasing the number of DALYs lost from 517 to 224. El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Peru also made remarkable efforts in the reduction of HIV burden in this decade. Nevertheless, all of these countries had among the highest burden of HIV/AIDS in the region in 2000, with DALYs in the 600s. As happens with infant and maternal it seems reductions easier to attain during the first of interventions and while there is a higher BoD. Within the LAC regional context, the change in burden of HIV/AIDS that occurred in Argentina is all the more remarkable, given that in 2000 the country had the fifth lowest absolute burden of HIV (284 DALYs per 100,000 people), yet the country was able to further reduce its burden by 21.2 percent. The size of the change was similar to that of El Salvador, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Peru, all of which had burdens over 600 DALYs ( figures 2.9 HIV/AIDS Burden in LAC The analysis below will focus on the current burden of HIV in middle-income countries in Latin America that can be compared with Argentina and that have had good performance toward the reduction of HIV BoD in the past decade (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru). In the framework of the analysis, it is important to understand where countries stand in current burden, as beginning and HIV/AIDS burden the region in 2010, actually showed an increase in the burden seemingly interventions, to modify their endemic channel and make improvements, yet have not achieved an extremely low rate of burden. From 2000 to 2010, there was a 57 percent reduction in the burden of HIV/ AIDS in Mexico, making the country a best performer in LAC. Although triple therapy for HIV was introduced in 1996, it was not until 2003 that waiting lists for access to treatment disappeared. The provision of universal access to treat-ment through the national health system allowed the country to significantly reduce the BoD and reach the low HIV prevalence of 0.2 percent ( Secretar\u00eda de Salud 2012 ). Chile is another good performer. ART was first introduced in Chile in 1993, after the creation in 1990 of the National Commission for AIDS, which 48 Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina: Global and Regional Comparative Analysis Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7was created to act as the technical body responsible for the design, executive coordination, and global evaluation of the HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention Program in Chile. However, it was not until 2003 that the public health system offered universal coverage to all patients. Before then, because of the high costs of drugs the low budget available of the illness, determined different combinations of treatments. It was not until the National Commission for AIDS and UNAIDS negotiation with the pharmaceutical companies in June 2001 that the price of treatment was reduced on average by 50 percent. Moreover, there was a 33 percent increase in 2.9 Change in DALYs, and YLDs in Latin America, 2000-10 c.

Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina: Global and Regional Comparative Analysis 49 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7budget in 2003, which helped ART coverage to 100 percent of diagnosed patients in the public sector and 100 percent coverage in the preventive treat-ment of HIV/AIDS vertical transmission through pregnancy. In addition, starting in 2005, the private sector began to guarantee 100 percent ART coverage. Chile does not use ART generics, which increases the cost of treatment ( C\u00e1ceres and Garc\u00eda 2012 ). Chile had the second lowest BoD in 2010, but experienced an increase of 28 percent in the number of DALYs lost to HIV between 2000 and 2010. This increase may have been because of improvements in case notification, diagnosis, and increased sharply until 2003, with a decrease in 2006 and a subsequent increase. From 2006 to 2009, the increase in the number of notifications achieved a maximum rate of 7.4 per 100,000 people (9.0 per 100,000 in men). This increase is once more related to the introduction of an online surveillance system When comparing Chile with Argentina, although the former had an increase in its HIV burden of 28 percent from 2000 to 2010, the latter was able to reduce its burden by 21 percent in the same period. Peru has taken many actions in the past decade to reduce its BoD by over 40 percent. As of 2010, it presented a BoD of 450 DALYs per 100,000 ( figure 2.12) . to address the HIV epidemic consistently until 1995, when there was a stabilization of the country's political situation, but it was not until the past few years that the country has incorporated several pre-vention programs, including Figure 2.10 Burden of HIV in Latin America, 2000 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000GuyanaPanamaHondurasColombiaPeruEl SalvadorBrazilMexicoBoliviaVenezuela, RBEcuadorParaguayGuatemalaArgentinaUruguayCosta RicaChileNicaragua HIV/AIDS DALYs per 100,000 c e : IHME 2013b.

One of the current major challenges in reducing the HIV BoD is the high prevalence of tuberculosis/HIV co-infection, which poses a major threat to the country ( Ministerio de Salud de Peru, Direccion General de Epidemiologia 2013 ). Although Brazil still has a large burden of HIV and is home to the majority of cases in the region, the country's efforts against HIV/AIDS are noteworthy. The National AIDS Control Program, which was established in 1986, has since Figure 2.11 Change in HIV Notification Rate in Chile, by Sex, 1984-2010 0 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 20102468101214HIV notification rate per 100,000 inhabitants Male Total Female S o u r c e : C\u00e1ceres and Garc\u00eda 2012 .

Brazil became one of the first countries to have free and universal provision of ARTs, including protease inhibitors, as of widely criticized of the high demonstrates that the very large increase in survival between the 1980s and 1996 could only be explained by the introduction of ARTs. Moreover, the context of these countries. Similar to Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Peru, Argentina is a middle-income country with a large territory and important disparities at the economic and social levels. Argentina was, together with Brazil, a pioneer in LAC in introducing a compre-hensive and universal health care program. Both governments prioritized treat-ment, providing universal access to ART for people with advanced HIV infections through public health systems. As a result, the burden of HIV/AIDS decreased by 21 percent from 2000 to 2010 in Argentina (equivalent to 14,467 DALYs). In 2010, there were lost to HIV/AIDS ( IHME 2013b ). In the past decade, Argentina has become one of the best performers in the reduction of the HIV/AIDS burden, measured by actual Although Peru showed higher than Argentina's (794 compared with 284 DALYs per 100,000 people in 2000), which likely contributed to a steeper and quicker reduction in the burden of HIV compared with that Argentina during Countries in Latin America, 2000-10 -50 -30 -10 10 03 0EcuadorChileBoliviaColombiaParaguayBrazilArgentinaPeru Percentage of change in DALYs 2000-10 S o u r c e : IHME 2013b.

All of these contributed only to burden reduction, but also to the sustainability of the reduction over time. Conclusion Argentina has the second lowest BoD in South America after Chile, a BoD that has continued to decrease since 2000. Analysis of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico shows that a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS, in which universal access and treatment coverage is provided for ART, has been the key to BoD reduc-tion. In these countries, national HIV/AIDS programs made access to treat-ment available to all. From the beginning of the epidemic, Brazil has evidenced a strong will to focus its strategy on universal access to treatment, strong prevention policy, and promotion of human rights. The partnership between the private sector, civil society, and the public sector has been the key to achieve a sustainable price of treatment through the manufacturing of generic drugs. This path has proven effective to tackle the epidemic and change the projected path of infection. Different from these cases, Chile has struggled during the past decade to find sustainable options to cover universal ART. Budget constraints, issues the use of generic drugs, and incentives to move from the private sector to the public sector have contributed to an expensive individual price for treatment. Although Argentina had the third lowest BoD in South America in 2000 and the fifth lowest in Latin America, it still managed to have the second largest percentage decrease from 2000 to 2010, after Peru. In this time period, Argentina's HIV burden decreased by 21 percent, saving 4,379 potential lives. This large decrease is evidence of the potential to reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS even when the burden is relatively low, thus setting an example in the region on what is possible to achieve through the creation of public policies to the reduction of HIV/AIDS. However, compared with similar economies in Europe, it is clear that Argentina remains behind in the burden of HIV/AIDS. This does not mean, however, that Argentina has to revisit its program in light of the national pro-grams or policies of other countries, since some of them have different approaches. But it does mean that Argentina needs to develop a more lessons learned in other situations, and innovate.

BoD varies across the 24 provinces that make up the federal structure of the country. Implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Program varies depending on the decisions made by each of the HIV/AIDS equation. Most of the total HIV cases in Argentina are concentrated in four provinces; in two of these provinces, HIV prevalence rates have decreased in the past decade, while they increased in the other two provinces. As a result, the epidemiological patterns and BoD are changing within provinces and slightly from men to women, generating a panorama that differs greatly from that of 10 years ago. The chapter will address the following: (a) the methodology used to calculate the burden of HIV in Argentina in 2005 and 2010 by province and sex; (b) the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS at the interprovincial level; (c) comparative burden Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [IHME] 2013), Argentina performed the first BoD study in 2010, with data from 2005 ( Borruel, Mas, and Borruel 2010 ). The study was supported by the Essential Public Health Functions Project (EPHFP) in an effort to improve the National Health Intelligence System. The goal of the study was to strengthen the 56 Subnational Analysis of the Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7formulation and implementation of evidence-based findings to reduce the BoD. The Argentina is a systematic assessment that calculates the diseases that cause life years (DALYs), a time-based measure Borruel 2010 The study by Borruel and others has been used as the baseline for a series of other BoD studies at the subnational level. In this chapter, we will present the results of a study performed in Argentina in 2013 on the comparative BoD of HIV/AIDS at the provincial level. The study provides data on the burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina by prov- ince and sex for 2005 and 2010. The data are analyzed with a new methodology from IHME's 2010 GBD study ( Murray and others 2012 ). 1 The data are pro- vided in tables 3A.1 - 3A.4 for all provinces for 2005 and 2010. Calculations were made to adapt the available data at the provincial level. The calculation of YLLs was done without applying the three percent social adjustment of death in different age groups, as is recommended by the 2010 GBD. The life expectancy table was set at 86 years for men and women, and values of the burden of disability for based on values from the 2010 GBD ( Murray and others 2012 ). Finally, ages were grouped in ranges compatible with the information available in Argentina; although the 2010 GBD methodology is based on 20 age ranges that include early neonatal, late neonatal, and post neonatal, the study utilized 16 age ranges of YLLs, the 2010 GBD methodology presents no challenges when disaggregating the database by sex and age. On the contrary, the methodology for calculating YLDs was not published and the results seem to be the product of the analysis of several distinct populations that are used as occur-rence IHME, on rates for incidence rates. The use of data countries where this information is available strengthens the calculation. In it allows incidence of disease on a population across many years or when one seeks to understand the result of an intervention to Incidence information was based on notification registries from the Ministry of Health (MSN) and related organisms in Argentina and its provinces in 2005 and 2010. The distribution of incident cases by jurisdiction was done by sex and age range according to available data. However, although the BoD data by sex are solid, 2 the age distribution is less reliable, as the number of cases by sex in age ranges is not published and the data are only available in proportion tables. Distribution by age must be calculated, but the numbers will not be as precise as Subnational Analysis of the Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina 57 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7the number of individual cases registered. For this reason, this study should not be used to identify the number of cases of HIV attributable to vertical transmission. In the methodology applied for burden of follows: \u0081 Of the population infected with HIV in Argentina, 30 percent is unaware of their condition as recognized by MSN. For the calculations, the study these asymptomatic. This the weight of 0.20, which was accepted by the 2010 GBD, and we consider that these indi-viduals will come to know of their HIV status within a five-year time span. \u0081 According to the 2010 under treat- ment is 0.053. We consider that weight for a period of 10 years, which is the average length of treatment from the start of highly active antiretroviral treat-ment (HAART), and we apply it to the 73 percent of patients who are in treatment in Argentina. \u0081 Twenty-seven percent of patients are not under 0.55 went of the disease before death. As such, we assigned a period of six months for the terminal stage with a weight of 0.56 and one month of stage disability of of patients younger than 15 years of age are under treatment and that they only add YLDs for their condition. For the number of deceased, we used the adjustment recommended by the Office of Statistics and Health Information (DEIS). The adjustment comes from the multifactorial statistical study conducted to present the real number of noti-fied deaths and the percentage by DEIS recommends a rate of percent for 2005 and a rate of 28.5 percent for 2009 and 2010. The study uses various sources of data. For mortality data, the study uses statistics and health information from DEIS for 2005 and 2010. Data on inci-dence are derived from an MSN database and specifically from the National HIV/AIDS and STDs Office (Direcci\u00f3n de SIDA y ETS [DSyETS]). 4 Population data were obtained from the 2005 National ( INDEC 2005 ). Finally, fol- lowing the classifications Ministry Argentina, provinces were grouped into the following regions: the City of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires (24 partidos of the province of Buenos Aires), the Center Region (the remaining 11 partidos of the province of Buenos Aires and the provinces of Santa Fe, C\u00f3rdoba, and Entre R\u00edos), the Northwest region (the provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta, La Rioja, Santiago del Estero, and Tucum\u00e1n), the Northeast region (Corrientes, Formosa, and Chaco), Cuyo (Mendoza, San Juan, and San Luis), and Patagonia (Chubut, La Pampa, Neuqu\u00e9n, Rio Negro, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego). 58 Subnational Analysis of the Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Subnational Epidemiological Analysis Because federal are significant differences across provinces in the quality of and access to health services. Although the disparities have decreased over time, Argentina in terms of HIV/AIDS burden when comparing provincial data. Ten years ago, HIV cases were concentrated in large urban areas (as is the case in the majority of middle-income countries); recent years have seen urban cen- ters. The provinces with the most HIV cases reported from 2001 to 2012 were Buenos Aires, with 42.8 percent of the cases, followed by the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, with 16.7 percent; C\u00f3rdoba, with 7.9 percent; and Santa Fe, with 5.5 percent ( MSN 2013 ). These of accu-mulated HIV cases over the past decade, while the other 20 provinces together accounted for the remaining 25 percent of diagnosed HIV cases. Nonetheless, the province of Buenos Aires, the City of Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe were the only localities to show decreases in HIV/AIDS from 2001 to 2011 (52.86, 41.13, percent decreases, respectively), while an increased in HIV infections ( MSN 2013 ) show similar behavior, although the disparities City of Aires, incidence rates decreased from 40.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001 to 23.9 per 100,000 in 2011; and in the province of Buenos Aires, incidence rates decreased from 21 to 9.9 per 100,000 in the same time frame. Although the trend is positive, the incidence rate in the City of Buenos Aires is double that in all other regions. In the Cuyo, Northwest, Northeast, and steadily increased 17 per 100,000, respectively. Following a peak in 2003, all three regions showed a sudden decrease tied to the introduction of ART. In the Center (C\u00f3rdoba and Santa Fe), where a high number of cases are concentrated, there has been a steady decrease since 2005, to the current incidence rate of 10.5 per 100,000 inhabitants. The analysis of notification rates can go as far back as 2001, when HIV became a notifiable disease (see figures 3.1 and 3.2) . At that time, 48 percent of total diagnoses were in the province of Buenos Aires, followed by the City of Buenos Aires (19 percent), C\u00f3rdoba (6.6 percent), and Santa Fe (4.9 percent). Between 2001 and 2012, in the City of Buenos Aires, the number of notified HIV diagnoses declined from 19 to of total nationally reported cases; in the province Aires, the HIV diagnoses declined from 48 to 30.5 percent during frame. In all other provinces, HIV/AIDS notifications increased in the last decade, which is likely related to service improvements in the provinces and During percent of came Subnational Analysis of the Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina 59 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7region, 5.3 percent from the Northeast region, 8.1 percent from the Cuyo region, 7.8 percent from the Patagonia region, and 34 percent from Buenos Aires and the City of Buenos Aires. Disparities across provinces and regions are even larger when analyzed by sex. Although a first look at the regional comparison shows that the regions with higher prevalence are the same for men and women, the burden rates vary. The data show that disparities in men are larger than those among women, which is likely related to access to health services and the type of transmission ( figure 3.3) .

Map 3.1 HIV Incidence in Argentina, by Province, 2001 and 2011 (continued ) HIV incidence rates among men in the City of Buenos Aires are more than double the rates among men in other regions. Although the City of Buenos Aires now has a rate of 43 per 100,000 men, other regions have much lower rates, from 21 per 100,000 in Patagonia to nine per 100,000 in Northeast. Northwest, Cuyo, Center, and the province of Buenos Aires have a rate of 17 per 100,000 men, in line with the national average. For women, differences across regions are smaller and have been diminishing over time. Today, the City of Buenos Aires has a rate of 26 per 100,000 women and all other regions are below 12 per 100,000. Subnational Analysis of the Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina 61 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Prevalence rates in women decreased by almost half in the past decade in the City of Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires. The regions with lower incidence (Patagonia, Cuyo, and Northwest) have seen a remarkable increase in HIV prevalence in recent years in men and women ( figure 3.4) . In the Patagonia region, the incidence of HIV among women increased 60 percent between 2001 and 2011; in men, the increase was close to 50 percent. Among men, Cuyo and Northwest had an increase of 87 percent in the same period; HIV rates among women have increased by 67 and 116 percent, respectively, in Cuyo and Northwest. Subnational Burden of Disease Analysis Results from the HIV/AIDS Argentina evidence high heterogene- ity across provinces and regions. In line with tendencies shown by the epidemio-logical data derived from the study, it is possible to make comparisons by province and sex in two time periods between 2005 and 2010. At the provincial level, the burden of HIV/AIDS varies from 12 per 100,000 inhabitants in Catamarca to 433 and 444 per 100,000 inhabitants in Salta (Northwest) and Tierra del Fuego (Patagonia region), respectively, with a national average of 194 per 100,000 in 2010 ( figure 3.5) . regions. Although there was a slight decrease in Buenos Aires and the Center from 2005 to 2010, the burden increased in Northwest, Northeast, Cuyo, and Patagonia in these years, in line with trends analyzed for notification and incidence.

Although the decline was achieved at a slow rate, it has been sustained over time. By contrast, other regions suffered a sharp peak in their rates during the same period: Patagonia increased its BoD by 75 percent from 2005 to 2010, going from 796 to 1,400 cases per 100,000. The region of Cuyo followed, with an increase of 73 percent, and Northeast and Northwest had rates around 37 and 28 percent, respectively. Among all 24 provinces, only six were able to reduce their BoD between 2005 and 2010 (Buenos Aires, City of Buenos Aires, Neuqu\u00e9n, Catamarca, San Juan, Figure 3.2 Changes in HIV Province, per population 051015202530354045 Buenos Aires (-53)CABA (41) Santa Fe (-7) Misiones (7) Tierra del Fuego Pampa (102)San Luis (109)Jujuy (111) Santa Cruz (126) Santiago del Estero (150)Catamarca (314)La Rioja (315) Percent 2002 2006 2004 2008 20102003 2001 2005 2009 2007 2011 Source : MSN 2013.

On average, in all other provinces, the HIV burden increased by 130 percent in five years\u2014an increase that was mostly concentrated in adult men. At the subnational level, there large disparities in HIV/AIDS burden, although this tendency seems over There is no clear evi-dence on why some provinces had a surge in their rates; however, there is a sense that prevention and treatment efforts in large urban centers\u2014where cases used to be concentrated\u2014are yielding reductions in rates. The study shows that 18 of the 24 provinces increased their BoD during 2005 to 2010. Although small increase in burden (less than 12 percent, with the exception of Misiones, which had an increase of 21 percent), 12 provinces had increases of 759 percent. Among these exponential increases, the provinces of the Patagonia region were the leaders in HIV/AIDS burden, with the exception of Neuqu\u00e9n.

The burden in the provinces in the Northeast region also had high rates of (Formosa, . Changes in the HIV/AIDS at the provincial level show striking results. Although there was a reduction in the HIV burden among women in some provinces, there was also an increase in the burden among men in those same provinces between 2005 and 2010. The reverse also occurred, with an increase in the HIV and a decrease in the burden among men occurring in the same province. Ten provinces (Chubut, C\u00f3rdoba, Corrientes, Formosa, Misiones, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Fe, Tierra del Fuego, and Tucum\u00e1n) showed opposite changes in the burden of HIV for men and women between 2005 and 2010. Among women, the burden in Chubut increased from Figure 3.5 HIV/AIDS Burden of Disease, by Province in Argentina, 2010 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 : Borruel, Mas, and Borruel 2010 .

The same situation occurred in C\u00f3rdoba, where the burden among women almost doubled from 2005 to 2010 (from 44 to 82), while it decreased among men (from 228 to 214). The HIV burden among women in Santa Fe, C\u00f3rdoba, Corrientes, and San Juan also increased, while it decreased among men. By con-trast, in San Luis and Tucum\u00e1n, there was an improvement in incidence among women, situation seemed to be worsening among men. Finally, Tierra del Fuego and Formosa had an exponential increase in the burden of HIV/AIDS among men, from 161 to 831 per 100,000 and from 45 to 224 per 100,000, respectively, from 2005 to 2010. Among women, disease prevalence seemed to decrease (from 218 to 22 per 100,000 in Tierra del Fuego and from 62 to 47 per 100,000 in Formosa). 5 The province of Tierra del Fuego, however, is a specific case, because of its low population and high internal and external migration, which could bias the data when comparing one year with another ( figure 3.8) . All rates and women, although the rates of change varied. While Buenos Aires, the City of Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Neuqu\u00e9n, and Santiago del Estero showed similar rates of HIV/AIDS burden reduction in the past five years, Chaco, Entre R\u00edos, Jujuy, and Salta saw an increase in rates for men and women.

Conclusion In 2013, a BoD analysis for HIV/AIDS was carried out at the provincial level of Argentina to assess differences in prevalence of the disease and changes over time. The study used the new GBD methodology from IHME's 2010 study. In line with tendencies shown by the epidemiological data, results from the national average DALYs due to HIV/AIDS was 194 DALYs per 100,000 people in 2010, 6 the HIV/AIDS burden varies from 12 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants in Catamarca to 433 and 444 per 100,000 inhabitants in Salta and Tierra del Fuego, respectively.

Finally, analysis by sex at the provincial level shows high discrepancies in BoD change between 2005 and 2010. During the past decade, Argentina was able to reduce its HIV/AIDS BoD by 21 percent, constituting the second highest reduction in South America after Peru. In 2010, Argentina had one of the lowest BoDs in the region. However, among all 24 provinces, only six were able to reduce their BoD between 2005 and 2010, two of which had the most cases in the region. Eighteen of the 24 provinces increased their BoD in the same period and, in line with the avail-able epidemiological data, these increases were particularly high in Patagonia and the Northwestern region of the country. The province of Santa Cruz had the highest burden increase, followed by La Pampa (190 percent), (175 percent), and Formosa (155 percent). Although reductions in large urban areas are related to strong policies of pre- vention and treatment, it is not clear why some provinces saw a surge in their rates during the past years. In particular, in some regions, it will be challenging for MSN to bring on changes, stigma, education may have affected increase treatment provision has posed challenges related to access to health services, some provinces.

The National HIV/AIDS Program has strengthened its territorial presence, working with provincial minis-tries to reduce gaps and increase access to treatment and prevention policies. According a recent supply-side study chapter 4), 90 percent of HIV/AIDS program heads reported an improvement in the supply of and access to preventive, diagnostic, and health care services for people living with HIV/AIDS. Moreover, there has been a substantial increase in the procure-ment and distribution of condoms throughout the country, as well as the instal-lation of fixed delivery points that ensure systematic distribution and improved accessibility. Results could be seen in the coming years. However, the demand side is still in need of new actions at the national and provincial levels. 72 Subnational Analysis of the Burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina Thirty Years of the in .

As the new methodology was published with general parameters for calculations, the team in Argentina recreated different analytical models to verify that the procedures used were similar to those of the IHME group. Moreover, there are no provincial-level data in the IHME results. 2. In HIV/AIDS bulletins from the Argentine National Health Ministry (MSN), there is information about the ratio of men to women for each region. With enough analysis time, it would be possible to obtain a more precise adjustment of the distribution of incidence by sex for each province. The time limitations and the publication of HIV/AIDS Bulletin Number 30 in the last days of December 2013 allowed for an adequate calculation of the HIV province. is in attributing disability until the moment of death. Although this is it is not known whether IHME considers this rationale in from table 3.1 , \"Cases and Rates of HIV per 100,000 People by Jurisdiction and Year of Diagnosis, Argentina (2001-11),\" page 69 of the HIV/AIDS Bulletin number 30, December 2013. 5. Information from the MSN HIV Bulletin 2013 shows that the rate of HIV among women and men in Tierra del Fuego was erratic between 2001 and 2011. The com-parison between two periods of time, then, should not be considered determinate of the future tendency of disease. 6.

The study was a partial replica of a similar survey conducted in 2007, which served as a baseline for the strategic planning for DSyETS from 2008 to 2011 ( Weller and others 2009 ). The 2012 study included the HIV/AIDS programs of the 24 provincial jurisdictions, 10 of the 12 health regions of the province of Buenos Aires, and 18 municipal AIDS programs that had been in operation for at least one year. The study also surveyed 191 hospitals and 348 primary health centers that are part of the national public health system. Although based on the previous survey, the 2012 study also incorporated a viral hepatitis investigation and surveyed a fragmentation between prevention and care was overcome at the local level. The study focused on four main areas: (a) access to prevention inputs; (b) access to diagnostic counseling; (c) comprehensive care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), viral hepatitis, and STIs and (d) management of epidemiological information. The research carried out by the Studies and Monitoring Area was developed through a participatory model involving 78 HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Thirty Years of HIV/AIDS Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7prevention, communication, and assistance teams programs defining objectives, formulating data survey instruments, conducting local surveys, and selecting health indicators to be included in the sample. In addition, this collaborative process became a vehicle for setting col-laborative HIV/AIDS agendas among program managers and local actors. The main objective of the study was to generate quality information that would support actions to and the of the research was designed inform deci-sion making with the goal of triggering changes at the local level. This chapter presents a comparison between the 2007 baseline data and the 2011 results from the supply of services survey. The chapter discusses prevention, diagnostic, and HIV/AIDS care service indicators that have been part of the Essential Public Health Functions Project (EPHFP) since 2009. Conceptual Definitions of the Participatory Diagnostic Study A few key concepts must be clarified to set this study apart from more traditional monitoring and evaluation studies. First, we understand health and sickness as complex and mutable processes that may have multiple determinations. As such, health care cannot be reduced to but must embrace various practices, ( Men\u00e9ndez 1994 ). Considering care as a process can help delimi- tate the sphere in which the state and other actors may act with the objective of producing better results in health. The health processes can only be understood in the historic context of the public sector's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and can be observed at the time of diagnosis and provision of health services for affected persons and popu-lations. These instances integrate the knowledge and practices of professional health care workers and those of the population that requires care. Access to health care involves health care professionals and the population seeking care. As such, considering access from only one side of the spectrum (most often the supply side) means fragmenting the full and complex reality. This one-sided view hides the fact that the population seeking health care is also involved in constructing the concept of access and should therefore have their health and life practices represented in studies of access to a health care system ( Comes and others 2007 ). In the particular case of the response of a survey instrument providers and the population that seeks care. Research as a tool for management was among the main conceptual contribu- tions from the previous study, since that study was the foundation for developing a participatory working method (Weller and others 2009). This method promoted of local programs HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment 79 of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7in systematically epidemic. Expanded management triggers a democratization of the forms of care, in which exchanges that incorporate new actors and new perspectives on of municipalities deepened the local point of view, since it assumed that the provincial and national levels bring different perspectives. Methodology Although the main focus of this chapter is the HIV/AIDS response in Argentina, the development of the study brought to light issues of accessibility to promotion, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up services for other diseases. The public health subsector is the universe of inquiry, while provincial, munic- ipal, and regional AIDS programs are units alongside hospitals and health care facilities. The sample includes all programs from the 24 provinces and 10 of the 12 sanitary health regions of the province of Buenos Aires. Eighteen municipal programs were selected based on their level year. Health centers were selected among those that were part of Programa Remediar, 1 a project financed by the of Response to HIV survey conducted in 2008. The sample is intentional, since the selection of health care facilities is not statisti-cally representative; each unit of study was selected by other criteria (the study objectives and the search for typical cases). Between eight and 10 health care facilities (hospitals and health centers) were selected per jurisdiction. Questionnaires from the 2008 research were the basis for developing instruments for this study and DSyETS suggested adaptations (Weller and others 2009). The survey included questions for capturing data from the municipal and local distinct were questions. DSyETS selected 53 interviewers from a list provided local program heads to disseminate the questionnaires in hospitals and health centers. Interviewers were trained and gathered survey data from 191 hospitals (13 of which were maternity hospitals) and 348 primary health care centers.

Comparative Analysis for 2007-11 This section analyzes the results of the surveys conducted in 2011 and compares them with the results of the 2007 surveys. The comparative analysis is divided into three areas: prevention materials, diagnosis, and health care. Prevention Materials The distribution of condoms increased 250 percent over four years, jumping from 8,550,780 distributed in 2007 to 29,841,880 4.1) .

Moreover, this policy trans-formed the main financing 2013\u2014three times the In and 2012, fewer condoms were distributed because of delays in the international bidding processes. 4 At the juris- dictional and health provider levels, the increase in condom distribution was greater than 200 percent over four years. The 2007 and 2011 surveys showed that health care facilities established requirements for condom distribution, such as a medical prescription or collection of personal data from those requesting condoms. Nonetheless, in 2011 only 10 the prerequisites, compared with varied greatly by jurisdiction and distribution largely took place events. In 2007, the average number of condoms distributed at fixed points in the 21 jurisdictions was 37 percent of all condoms distributed, fixed distribution points in each jurisdic-tion, as reflected in the 2011 data, which show that the jurisdictions accounted for between 80 and 100 percent of condom figure 4.2) locations are routinely visited by the population inside and outside the health system, at public institutions and civil society organizations. As of September 2013, there was a total of 3,156 fixed condom distribution points in all provinces, an 8.7 percent increase from 2012. The City of Buenos Aires and Central regions have the majority of these points ( figure 4.3) : 15 percent are located in the City of Buenos Aires, 38 percent in the province of Buenos Aires, 38 percent in Santa Fe, and seven percent in C\u00f3rdoba. In addition, DSyETS has been involved in the production of a variety of com- munication materials that target specific populations ( figure 4.4) . At the time of study, 79 percent of health facilities reported that the arrival of such material health centers was sporadic. In response, DSyETS prioritized production communication providers in 2011 reported 82 HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Figure 4.2 Number to the Negro S o u r c e : MSN 2012 .

In 2007, 17 Diagnostic Services Until 2007, DSyETS had no national policy to promote active testing. The 2007/2008 investigation served as a baseline for designing policies and population. This pol-icy resulted in the mobilization of resources and the creation of Centers for Prevention, Counseling, and Testing and other spaces to facilitate access to HIV testing and counseling, which counted on the financial support of the EPHFP ( figure 4.5) . In 2007, 25 percent of health care institutions counted on a specialized team for pre- and post-HIV test counseling. In 2011, this percentage increased to 32 percent. Similar to 2007, in 2011 counseling teams were more frequently found in hospitals than in health centers. In hospitals, the prevalence rose from 39 to 47 percent over four years; in primary health care institutions, it increased from 17 Figure 4.5 of Centers for Prevention, Counseling, Fuego 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 S o u r c e : MSN 2013.

HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment 85 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Testing for male partners of pregnant women remains one of the major systematic health challenges, as the supply of testing for this subpopulation has not yet been made universal. The 2011 survey did not find the anticipated increase the number of hospitals that provide testing increased from 36 to 71 percent and the number of health centers increased from 23 to 52 percent over the period analyzed. Last, DSyETS has been promoting the incorporation of rapid HIV testing in the public health system ( figure 4.6) . The percentage of hospitals that use rapid testing increased from 75 to 88 percent between 2007 and 2011. In 2007, rapid testing was used almost exclusively for peripartum HIV diagnoses. In 2011, in addition to the 77 percent (40) of HIV program managers who responded that their jurisdiction used the testing in peripartum, (29) confirmed use for post-exposure accidents, 44 percent (23) for rape cases, and 19 percent (10) for exposure through unprotected sex. Of the 168 hospitals that reported using rapid HIV testing, 69.6 percent rapid accidents, 51.2 percent (86) percent (35) in the case of unpro- tected sex, percent (79) percent (137) The use of rapid testing in most hospitals may be a result of recommendations from DSyETS Health Care Services From 2007 to 2011, there was a national increase in the number of institutions providing HIV/AIDS care services to adults, pregnant women, and children.

Most jurisdictions maintained increased the number providers that serve the seropositive population. From 2007 to 2011, the 28 jurisdictions that participated in both surveys showed an treatment (ART) used drugs provided by the Ministry of Health (MSN), while in 2011 that number rose to 70 percent. In 2007, 104 hospitals reported monitoring 26,670 people and 158 hospitals reported the percentage of multidisciplinary teams 5 increased from 58 to 62 percent. Nonetheless, the latest study shows that many of the multidis-ciplinary teams include members of civil society and PLWHA (in seven percent of all health care facilities). Although there has been a tremendous effort to disseminate information on the modes of transmission and standards of care for PLWHA, negative attitudes and discrimination are still present in the health care system. PLWHA face underlying discrimination even when seeking care for ailments not associated with their seropositive status. In 2011, 73 percent of favor-able outlook for the public response to HIV. However, 22.7 percent of health centers were not able to serve seropositive people because of the need services. Similarly, they mentioned problems with cross-specialty consultations for people with HIV, especially between mental health and emergency care, which are referred to other hospitals. In 2011, infectology services for HIV patients were mostly open during the mornings from Monday to Friday (30.4 percent) or once a week (25 percent). Some 34.2 (50) of the hospitals provided care on weekdays during the morning and early afternoon hours. Extended care hours (Monday to Saturday or Monday to Friday from 8:00 a.m. until after 5:00 p.m.) were observed in only eight hospitals. Although the 2007 study made no specific reference to opening hours, it is assumed that care offered during the afternoons and during extended recent changes. The study also examined the supply of viral load testing for PLWHA. The 2007 survey found that it took between 49 and 93 days from the time a viral load is requested until results are obtained. The data obtained in 2011 do not show substantial changes, with an average time between 45 and 75 days. Even longer delays were observed in a small number of health care institutions. In comparison, less time STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment 87 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7viral load tests. Data from 2011 indicate that the majority of surveyed hospitals (63 percent) take up to 30 days between blood samples and delivery of CD4 test results. There were instances of CD4 test longer than 30 days, yet delays never reached the wait times for viral load testing. In the absence of 2007 data on this item, it is impossible to make a comparative analysis. It should be noted that, although viral load testing requires prior approval from DSyETS, CD4 testing does not. An option to reduce delays in conducting viral load testing is to remove the requirement to request authorization. In (ARV) treatment in certain provinces. As a response, more distribution points were places that did not previously serve PLWHA, medicine services AIDS programs, among others. In the number ART medication increased by Most providers and health institutions (70 percent) did not report issues in the receipt or delivery of HIV medication in 2011. The 30 of of types stayed the or increased in 2007. two-thirds (114) the pharmacy, 10.8 percent (17) allowed access via other areas or services in the hospital, 9.5 percent (15) allowed access via the local or jurisdictional HIV program, and a small number accessed medication percent) or in addition to weekday mornings. According to data provided by the heads of the AIDS program, there was an increase from 151 hospitals and maternity facilities serving HIV-seropositive pregnant women in 2007 218 in 2008. Of the 127 maternity hospitals surveyed in 2007, 57 According to the mater-nity hospitals surveyed in 2007 women of 127 hospitals surveyed). percent of the hospitals and maternity facilities surveyed hospitals surveyed). These changes in the provision of to efforts DSyETS to Diagnosis, and Treatment Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 HIV testing was offered as part of prenatal care in the 175 hospitals that served pregnant women sampled in 2011. However, only 71 percent of these facilities offered HIV testing to both partners when the woman was seropositive. As noted in the previous section, there has been no substantial change in this regard since 2007. Regarding the supply of medication for preventing mother-to-child trans- mission (PMTCT) 2011. (AZT) available 90 in 2007 and 92 percent in 2011; replacement milk for exposed children was available in 98 and 92 percent of hospitals, in 2007 and 2011, respectively; and lacta-tion inhibitors were available in 87 percent of facilities in 2007 and 89 percent in 2011. As reported by the heads of the jurisdictional AIDS programs in 2007, 111 hospitals catered to children with HIV\u2014a number that rose to 140 in the 2011 study. In 2007, 43 percent of surveyed hospitals offered pediatric care to children exposed at the time of delivery. In 2011, 52 percent of the surveyed hospitals had equipment for the care of these children, while the remainder of the hospitals transferred these cases to other providers. Conclusion According to this study, 90 percent of HIV/AIDS program heads reported an improvement in the supply of and access to preventive, diagnostic, and health care services for PLWHA between 2007 and 2011. The reported improvements are based on a greater number of trained and skilled human resources for decentralized locations. In increased national purchasing in the procurement and distribution of condoms throughout the country as well as the installation of fixed delivery points that ensure systematic distribution and improved accessibil-ity. There has also increase in communication materials, including print materials (dominant in 2007) as well as audiovisual and other promotional mate-rials (key chains, fans, etc.). The 34 jurisdictions and 18 municipal programs reported having used the 0-800 telephone information line, and a large majority of them had consulted the website of DSyETS. Regarding access to diagnostic services, access of pregnant women to HIV testing improved between 2007 and 2011, but that improvement is not reflected in testing for couples. Although the HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment 89 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-725 percent of health in operation), is insuf- ficient information to evaluate the work quality of these teams. We also found that the integration of these multidisciplinary counseling teams into the health service system has not yet reached the goals established following the 2007 study. We that existing barriers to accessing HIV diagnostic services are linked to the structure of the health system and surpass the scope of specific issues related institutions preven- tive and health care to HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, inputs, diagnosis, and treat-ment, as well as the gradual development of technology that allows for monitoring. In 2007 and 2011, all regions counted health providers (hospitals and health these nationally for the care of adults and pregnant children with HIV. Nonetheless, intra-jurisdictional remain in of services offered by different institutions. Regarding service hours, there were no major differences between 2007 and 2011. In both years, all institutions served PLWHA at least during number of hospitals implemented extended service hours. We continue to observe a small rate of participation of PLWHA, civil society organizations, and sexually diverse people in health care services and support to the affected population. Another aspect that requires further improvement PLWHA in general hospitals and health centers. In light of three decades of knowledge on HIV/AIDS, dissemination of standards of care, and the distribution of state resources, all general hospitals are expected to care for PLWHA. However, 17 percent of the health facilities are to other centers to receive care, making the tracking of these patients through the health system a persistent issue. Although we observe some signs of improvement in the care of PLWHA (such as greater availability of testing of test results and discriminatory attitudes. The 2008 and 2012 studies aimed analyze key informants. A comprehensive under-standing of accessibility can only be obtained when the narrative is completed by those who compose the demand side of this system. 90 HIV/AIDS and STI Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 N o t e s 1. The Ministry of Health, with financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank, created Programa Remediar in response to the 2002 financial crisis as an effort to advance equitably the provision of primary health care and essential medications (http://www. remediar.gov.ar). 2. For the analysis of rates, we group the 24 provinces in the following regions, following the classification of the Ministry of Economy of Argentina (www.mecon.gov.ar): Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, Greater Buenos Aires ( 24 partidos of the province of Buenos Aires), Center region (the remaining 11 partidos of the province of Buenos Aires, the provinces of Santa Fe, C\u00f3rdoba, and Entre R\u00edos), Northwest (the provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Tucum\u00e1n), Northeast (Corrientes, Formosa, and Chaco), Cuyo (Mendoza, San Juan, and San Luis), and Patagonia (Chubut, La Pampa, Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego). 3. Hospitals included in the sample from the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires are \u00c1lvarez, Argerich, Durand, and Ramos Mej\u00eda. The data presented from responses on HIV, STIs, and hepatitis only include these four hospitals. 4.

There were two main challenges in conducting this study. First, the confiden- tiality law surrounding HIV/AIDS testing, diagnosis, treatment, and results in Argentina (as in many countries in the region) makes it difficult, if not impossi-ble, to obtain individual-level information or data to the patients a group. of HIV/AIDS. given the highly concentrated nature of the HIV epidemic in Argentina, country-level analysis that uses general data can misrepresent the size and direction of the relationship between demand-side risk factors and the HIV burden. This occur when the HIV-affected population has characteristics behaviors high-risk-of-infection group. The next section presents the methodology of the study and the following section presents analy-ses and results, which are last section Social and Economic Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 High-Risk Populations in Argentina Public to have for urban popula-tions in the province of Buenos Aires and the City of Buenos Aires. Continuing to reduce the HIV/AIDS burden will require cost-effective priority high-risk groups, while still providing universal preventive services and free access to HIV/AIDS treatment the In Argentina, sexual intercourse causes 90 percent of infections between men and women, most new with other men, 46.5 percent originated through sex with women. Vertical transmission caused one percent of new HIV infections among males in 2012 (compared with 3.4 percent in 2001) and about 3.4 percent among females (compared users from 2001 to 0.3 percent in 2012 among males, and from seven percent in 2001 to 0.1 percent in 2012 among females. Place of Residence From 2009 to 2011, 32 percent of new HIV diagnoses occurred in the Center of the country, 20 percent in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, 13 percent in the City of Buenos Aires, and 13 percent in Northwest (the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucum\u00e1n, Santiago del Estero, and Catamarca) (MSN 2013). S e x Sixty-seven percent of new HIV diagnoses occur among males\u2014a rate has remained The male-to-female ratio increases older older women. The male-to-female ratio is higher in the City of Buenos Aires than in any other region, at 3.1 new male diagnoses for every new female diagnosis (MSN 2013). Approximately one-third of new diagnoses occur among individuals ages 25 34 years for women, 22 percent of new infections occur among ages 15 to 24 years and 23 percent among women ages 35 to 44 years, with these two age groups accounting for a combined 45 percent of new infections. Among males, 26 percent of new cases occur in men ages 35 to 44 years and only 16 percent among males ages 15 to 24 years. The median age of new infections is higher among men (at 34 years of age) compared with Social and Economic Factors Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina 93 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7women (32 years of age). The median age of infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), 31 years, is lower than that of heterosexual men, whose median age of infection is 37 years (MSN 2013). Education Almost 50 women recently diagnosed with HIV completed primary education and some years of high school and 25 percent completed high school and some years of college. Among 32 percent of those recently diagnosed completed primary education and some years of high school and 30 percent completed high school and some years of college. Around 19 percent of recently diagnosed men completed college, compared with 10 percent of recently diagnosed women (MSN 2013). This analysis shows that the population most at-risk for contracting HIV in Argentina is males, ages 25 to 34 years, with a high school diploma, sexually active, engaging in sexual intercourse with men, and originating from the prov-inces of the Center territory of Argentina (including the province of Buenos Aires, the City of Buenos Aires, and most recently the Northwest provinces). Among young men ages 17 to 27, the analysis shows that 60 percent of transmis-sions occur through same-sex intercourse. In the case of men ages 56 and older, 20 percent of transmissions occur through homosexual percent heterosexual intercourse. This shows MSM and older heterosexual men are high-risk priority HIV groups, with an inflection point at age 30 (MSN 2013). Methodology Based on current knowledge of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Argentina, and on a review of the relevant literature, we identified several individual, interpersonal, social, and alcohol and nature the HIV/AIDS epidemic well as evidence-based literature related to key risk factors in the country, we chose to investigate how the following five risk (a) condom use, (c) education, (d) alcohol and drug use, and (e) income level. These five risk factors are widely used to understand the global spread of HIV; a brief review of the literature is included in each of the five case studies. An ideal analysis of demand-side risk factors would be based on individual- data at the individual level. Therefore, the data analyses are conducted at the country and provincial levels within Argentina. 94 Social and Economic Factors Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 This American countries.

In the next section, we analyze information from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) ( UNAIDS 2012 ). For the analysis on Argentina, we use additional information from the National Survey of Risk Factors 2009 ( MSN 2009 ) and the 2013 Epidemiological Bulletin of Argentina ( MSN 2013 ). We run a multiple linear regression and a bivariate analysis (simple correla- tions) to analyze relations exist relationship between HIV/AIDS burden ( y variable) and all the variables that we want to analyze ( x variables), to assess which x variables may have no relationship with y and which subsets of the x variables redundant disability-adjusted life years [DALYs] per 100,000 people). Data Analysis and Results Table 5.1 shows the results of the multiple linear regressions at the country level with selected economies (located in South America, the European Union, and the G7), based on epidemiological and economic characteristics. The dependent variable is the HIV/AIDS burden measured in DALYs per 100,000 people and the independent variables are education, alcohol and drug use, and violence. education ); is Social and Economic Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina 95 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7measured as the number of instances of self-harm and sexual abuse from GBD data in DALYs per 100,000 people; and alcohol and drug use is also measured in DALYs per 100,000 people, with data from GBD ( IHME 2013 ).

Violence According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS global estimates, 50 percent of people living with HIV are women. Although MSM, IDUs, and sex workers and their clients are the most affected groups in many areas of the world, the prevalence of HIV among other segments of the popula-tion has been growing worldwide over the past 10 years (WHO 2009). One of the key drivers of the HIV epidemic among women is gender-based violence. In Argentina, approximately 30 percent of people living with HIV are women ( MSN 2013 ). Physical, sexual, and emotional violence affects 10 to 60 percent of women ages 15 to 49 years worldwide. Forced sex can contribute directly to HIV trans-mission through tears and lacerations resulting from the use of Violence woman's ability and fear of violence can prevent women from learning and sharing their HIV status and seeking treatment, increasing their vulnerability to HIV (WHO 2009).

We use data from the GBD database to analyze two variables related to violence: (a) violence as a cause of disease or injury and (b) sexual abuse and violence as risk factors leading to BoD. Violence as a 1.5 percent, respectively, of the total DALYs in Argentina in 2010. The following analysis groups self-harm and interpersonal violence as abuse and violence account for 286.96 DALYs per 100,000 people in Argentina, which represents 1.07 percent of the risk factors of all causes in 2010. The sexual abuse and violence category is divided into two factor of DALYs for Argentine women in 2010. Analysis and Results Figure 5.1 presents time comparisons between for six countries in South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela. With the exception of Chile and Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela, the selected countries had a decrease in violence between 2000 and 2010. But they did not show a decrease in their levels of HIV/AIDS burden.

Argentina is at the other end of the spec-trum, with the lowest HIV/AIDS burden in South America after Chile, and is countries with the lowest self-harm and interpersonal violence bur-den, after Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay. There is an overall positive and significant correlation between self-harm also significant relation abuse and bur-den African and selected countries, but this relationship is insignificant in South America ( table 5.2 and figures 5.2 and 5.3) .

Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed of vari-ables. The about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used to reduce the set of variables in a data set. We use three highly correlated variables related to violence gathered from National Survey of Risk Factors data. These variables are based on answers to American countries disability-adjusted year.

The correla-tion ) and the women. However, there is no significant correlation between HIV and violence at the provincial level in Argentina, even when violence and HIV incidence were analyzed by sex. The lack of a significant correlation between violence and HIV incidence may be related to the concentrated nature of the epidemic in Argentina. As the epidemic is concentrated in specific subpopula-tions, there is a need to gather information pertaining to these populations transmitted infections (STIs). Research shows that a wide variety of individual, interpersonal, and social factors may influ-ence the choice engage in safe sexual For instance, in an analysis of 59 countries, Wellings others (2006) find that universal in premarital sex. The authors also found that men are more likely to have had two or more partners in the past year ( Wellings and others 2006 ).

Although condom use has global use remain low in many developing countries Wellings and others 2006 ). The use of condoms can still be associated with lack of trust ( King and Marston 2006 ) and the predictors of use, Adih Alexander 1999 ). find that even high-risk such as IDUs can reduce unprotected sex and increase use of the male condom through the help of interventions ( Semaan and others 2012 ).

For instance, only 81 percent of males and females ages 15-65 years were found to have used a condom during their last intercourse use increased segments in past decade, 90 percent of females and 88 percent of males diagnosed with HIV each year were infected through unpro-tected sex (MSN 2013). Given the high rates of new HIV infections through unprotected sexual intercourse in Argentina, this section seeks shed that we a probabilistic analysis with data from the National Surveys of Risk Factors (2005 and 2009) ( MSN 2005 , 2009). The determinants of condom use are proxy variables that influence the decision to condoms. We consider determinants education, medical insurance, and unemployment), individual risk factor determinants (age, sex, and being in a stable relationship), and social and cultural risk factors (habitual alco-hol consumption binge drinking). According of following risk factor determinants are considered independent variables: Age. Age is a discrete variable with the following categories: (a) 18 to 24 years, (b) 25 to 34 years, (c) 35 to 49 years, (d) 50 to 65 years, and (e) 66 years and older. Education level. Education level is a discrete variable that takes eight values: (a) no education, (b) incomplete primary special education. Income level. Income level is a discrete variable that takes four values: (a) no income, (b) low income monthly). . Medical a dichotomous variable. Unemployment: Unemployment is a dichotomous variable. Alcohol use. Alcohol use is divided into habitual alcohol consumption (more than one drink per day in the case of women and more than two drinks per day in the case of men) and binge drinking, which is the sporadic consumption of an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time (more than five drinks on one occasion). Stable relationship. Stable relationship is a dichotomous variable. A relationship is deemed stable from a \"married\" civil status or by people that cohabitate with a partner. Condom use is the dependent variable, which is attributed the value 1 if the individual or his or her partner uses a condom and 0 if the individual or his 104 Social and Economic Factors Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7or her partner does not use a condom, based on National Risk Factors question frequency of condom use between partners with the following answer categories: sometimes, always, they do not use protection, or they do not have sex. Since condom use is a binary dependent variable, we use a multivariable probabilistic model (i.e., probit) to establish the determinants that influence that variable. In statistics, a probit model is a type of regression where the dependent variable can only take two values (i.e., use of condom or no use). This model estimates the probability that an observation with particular characteristics falls into one of the two categories. After calculating the probit model, it is neces-sary to conduct a marginal effects analysis that takes the partial derivative of each independent variable with respect to the variable: = =Py xfi i[1 ]. The marginal the change in the conditional probability of occurrence times a marginal change in each of the other variables while holding everything else constant. We perform the probit as follows: condom use = (age, income level, education level, medical insurance, unemployment, alcohol use, stable relationship). We then conduct a marginal effects analysis to determine how much variation the dependent variable experiences when each independent variable increases by one unit, holding everything else constant. Since the analysis uses only discrete and dichotomous variables, the marginal effect analysis considers the increase from one category to the next. For discrete variables (age, education, and income level), a one-unit increase, for example, can be from 18-24 to 25-34 years of age within the age category. For the dichotomous variables (medical insurance, unemployment, habitual alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and stable rela-tionship), a one-unit increase could be from lacking medical insurance to having medical insurance within the medical insurance category, for example. The results show that sex, age, education level, and being in a stable relation- ship are the determinants with the highest marginal effect on condom use in 2005 and 2009 ( table 5.5) . With the exception of unemployment, all variables were significant in 2005, at least at the 10 percent significance level. In 2009, income level, unemployment, and habitual alcohol consumption were not significant. There is a positive relationship between the use of condoms and being male, and a negative relationship when the interviewee is in a stable relationship. Similarly, likelihood of use has positive and significant effect on the use of condoms in both years analyzed. In the analysis of the likelihood of condom use based on sex ( table 5.6) age binge are the most important predictors of condom use among Social and Economic to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina 105 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7women, although the marginal effects are small.

On the one hand, Argentina and Peru present a negative correlation (i.e., higher education, lower level of HIV/AIDS burden in 2010 compared with 2000); Chile and Venezuela, B.R., on the other hand, have a positive relation, showing an increase in HIV/AIDS burden and an increase in average years of schooling. Brazil and Colombia present almost no change in burden of HIV/AIDS, despite the increase in years of Argentina, find a positive relationship between mean level of schooling and HIV incidence at the provincial level. The City of Buenos Aires has the high-est level of schooling and the highest incidence of HIV ( figure 5.7) . Similar results are found in the analysis by sex, where there is a positive relation between mean level of schooling and HIV incidence. The City of Buenos Aires has the highest level of schooling among women and men, and men have a slightly higher educa-tional level (5.39 years for men and 5.34 for women).

Alcohol and Drug Use Alcohol and drug use disorders account for 2.89 percent of total DALYs Argentina, almost twice the global rate of total and 422.23 DALYs per 100,000 people in Argentina. Alcohol and drug use are also risk fac-tors that account for 1,604.43 DALYs per 100,000, which was 5.98 percent of the total DALYs in Argentina in 2010 ( IHME 2013 ). Moreover, alcohol and drug use is the risk factor responsible for 21.5 percent of the HIV/AIDS and tubercu-losis of 310.4 Injection drug use is an increasingly important cause of HIV transmission worldwide. Mathers and others (2008) estimate that about three million people, or about 19 percent of those who inject drugs, might be HIV positive. They find the largest numbers of IDUs in China, Russia, and the United States where HIV prevalence among IDUs is estimated at 12, 37, and 16 percent, respectively ( Mathers and others 2008 ). Similarly, (Map Network 1998) finds the HIV epi- demic Eastern Europe is drug use, prostitution, and behaviors Network 1998). This chapter has shown a negative correlation between habitual alcohol consumption and con-dom use among men in Argentina. Moving forward, we will unpack the relation-ship between alcohol and drug use and HIV infection.

Nonetheless, table 5.3 shows that GDP per explains the HIV controlling and drug use. Conclusion The analysis shows that income does not explain the HIV/AIDS burden in LAC or in Africa. Nonetheless, GDP per capita is highly correlated with HIV inci-dence at the provincial level in Argentina. It seems that income level could be associated with a set of behaviors that are risky for HIV infection in Argentina. 116 Social and Economic Factors Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7However, these findings should be further only allows us to establish correlations. Conclusion Since Argentina presents a epidemic, it to consider 25-34 year old sexually active man who has sex with men, with a high school diploma, and who is from the Central provinces of Argentina\u2014when designing policies, specifically for prevention. In the case of men ages 56 and older, 20 percent of transmissions occur through homosexual heterosexual find no significant correlation between HIV and violence at the provincial level in Argentina, even when violence and HIV incidence are analyzed by sex. The lack of a significant correlation may be because of the concentrated nature of the epidemic in Argentina. As the epidemic concentrates in a subpopulation of relatively young and educated MSM, more information is needed on the social behavior of this and other at-risk subpopulations. Regarding the use of condoms, the study shows that younger and more edu- cated Argentines are most likely to condoms inter-course. Although binge drinking is positively correlated to condom use for men and women, we found that habitual alcohol consumption negatively relates to condom use among men (but not among women). Moreover, men are more likely to use condoms with casual partners, although having multiple sexual partners does not reduce the risk of HIV infection. Although individual behavior change is central to improving sexual health, there is a need to address broader social determinants and risk factors of safe sexual behavior, including but not limited to the use of condoms. This study finds that education is positively correlated with HIV incidence at the provincial level in Argentina, a finding that is consistent with the priority HIV high-risk education programs must be adapted toward more edu-cated groups who are at higher risk of HIV infection. It is also important to con-sider the need for sexual and reproductive health education for all school age youth, which should be discussed openly in classrooms and in the Although there is a positive correlation between drug and alcohol use and the burden of HIV/AIDS in selected countries, we do not find a significant correla-tion between the use of those substances and HIV incidence in Argentina. These results are partially mediated by the absence of data on the use of injectable drugs\u2014which are a significant form of transmission\u2014at the provincial level within the country. Moreover, although we find that habitual alcohol consump-tion correlated to decreased condom use, this relationship does not Social and Economic Factors Related to the Demand Side of the HIV/AIDS Burden in Argentina 117 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7apply to binge drinking and no relationship is found between either habitual or binge drinking incidence. and HIV infection rates are the regional level in LAC, higher income does correlate with higher HIV incidence at the provincial level in Argentina. Once more, this finding is consistent with the profile of the most at-risk population in Argentina. The findings of this study reaffirm the need for behavioral interventions tailored to the social, economic, and behavioral characteristics of the groups at highest risk of HIV infection. For instance, although safe the relatively affluent and educated young who are most at risk for HIV infection. Similarly, additional data on drug use behavior in Argentina are needed to establish the real impact of IDUs on new HIV infections interventions to target population group that has a high prevalence of HIV and poses a substantial global health challenge. Behavioral interventions have shown there is no general approach to sexual and reproductive health education that will perfectly the the context. This will ultimately help to modify social norms to support behavior change and tackle that contribute to behavior relation and priority HIV high-risk groups vital possibility collection schemes that do not infringe on an individual's right to privately seek diagnosis, testing, and care for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.

Total health financing for all areas is US$40.889 billion per year (National Health Accounts, Argentina), 69 percent of which corresponds to general government expenditure on health. Argentina has consistently spent a relatively 122 Is Argentina Spending Its HIV/AIDS Progr am? A Cross-Country Comparative Analysis Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7high percentage of gross domestic product (eight to nine percent) on total health expenditures. General government expenditure on health fluctuates, generally remaining close to 60 percent of total health expenditures, while private insur-ance remains a small but significant portion of health spending. In 2012, total HIV corresponded to approximately expenditures. To conduct cross-country comparisons, we use data from 2009 to 2011. Total HIV domestic spending in Argentina in 2009 was US$287.1 million, a 65.5 percent increase since 2006, UNAIDS 2011) . among 23 LAC countries grew by 12 percent between 2008 and 2009, with only four countries (Grenada, Mexico, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago) showing declines in spending ( Ar\u00e1n-Matero and others 2011) 2012 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) Global Report data (UNAIDS 2012) show a 12.41 percent growth rate of total domes- tic HIV spending from 2009 to 2011 among the 11 countries with available information, 2 among which only Bolivia and Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela show a decline in spending. Given the increasing trend of HIV spending in Argentina and the region, it is vital to understand the source of funding, alloca-tion of funds between different HIV programs, and cost of treatment. Sources of Funding In 2009, external funding for HIV/AIDS in Argentina was only 0.25 spending on HIV/AIDS, percent of banks, 5.1 percent. Total spending from international funding came from bilateral sources (0.01 percent) and the United Nations (multilateral, 0.24 percent). 12.7 percent.

Among the LAC countries reporting 2009 and 2011 information to UNAIDS (2012), we find a seven percent average increase in external funding, with the exception of Bolivia, Cuba, Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

A Cross-Country Comparative Analysis Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Among the main multilateral donors, the World Bank and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis (GFATM) have helped Argentina in its fight against HIV/AIDS since 1997 and 2003, respectively. The World Bank has been a partner in Argentina's HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted disease Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Project (LUSIDA) and collaborated with the Ministry of Health of Argentina (MSN) to take immediate action and support the National Health Emergency Program ( World Bank 2004) . The program population, protection of the most disadvan-taged groups, and (c) continuity of public health services ( MSN 2004 ). LUSIDA invested US$15 million in HIV/AIDS (5.6 World Bank 2004) . The World Bank subsequently funded the Public Health Surveillance and Disease Control Project 1999, with a total committed amount equal to US$52.5 million to strengthen national, provincial, municipal, and other institutions responsible for public health policy and practice ( World Bank 2006 ). In 2006, the Essential Public Health Functions and Programs Project (EPHFP) ( World Bank 2013) (US$220 million) was approved with the objective to support Argentina's federal health plan ( World Bank 2004) and reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with communicable diseases ( World and US$29,335,432 for Argentina. 3 Figure 6.1, panel a, shows cumulative GFATM disbursements to Argentina since 2003, displaying 2008 and a subsequent leveling off. Figure 6.1, panel b, presents net GFATM disbursements since 2003, with negative net disbursements in 2009 and 2010. In 2013, GFATM net disbursements totaled US$1.49 million. In 2013, 62 percent of the 42 LAC countries and territories with available information reported being independent of external support for antiretroviral treatment (ART) funding, while 10 countries in the region highly depen-dent on external sources, as presented in table 6.3 (Pan American Health Organization [ PAHO] 2013) .

Since the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there has been debate on resource allocation to treatment versus prevention, a debate that is beginning to create consensus. On the one hand, some argue that money spent on prevention will save the most lives. On the other hand, other activists and researchers in the field argue that money spent medicines to treat already For instance, two pivotal studies of heterosexual couples where one of the partners has HIV have demonstrated that HIV-positive people who are on ART are about 20 times less likely to transmit the virus to their partners than people who are not taking treat-ment ( NAM 2014 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) and PAHO believe the expansion of combined HIV prevention and the provision of ART interventions can help achieve HIV-free generation. results burden of disease and based on universal treatment.

A ratio less than one indicates a broad expansion of ART and reduction of infectivity and that the response to the epidemic point 2012, based on data from 26 countries, was below one (with a value equal to figure 6.4) . A closer look at the budget of the National HIV/AIDS and STDs Office (Direcci\u00f3n de SIDA y ETS [DSyETS]) shows a constant increase in nominal terms over the past four years, more than doubling between 2009 and 2012. Table 6.4 shows that over 97.6 percent of the total 2009 budget was used to medicines and other used for personnel expenses, services, and consumption of goods.

In Argentina, the process has been improved and centralized, resulting in a break of the industry monopoly over retrovirals used for testing. There are wide differences in ART coverage in LAC (described in chapter 1). While Bolivia and Ecuador cover less than half of HIV patients, Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Mexico, and Cuba cover around or above 80 percent. Given the high proportion of HIV funds allocated to and the high variability of treatment costs among countries in the region, there is a pressing need for strategies to reduce costs. Regional and international organi-zations, such as the World Bank, WHO, and PAHO, may have a crucial role to play in supporting countries in reaching more competitive prices for ART at the regional level. Cross-Country Comparison of HIV/AIDS Spending The performance of the Argentine HIV/AIDS program can be compared with that of other economies in and outside the LAC region by calculating cost per DALY based on UNAIDS (2012) and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME 2013) data. To do so, expenditure (includ- ing international HIV/AIDS spending and HIV/AIDS burden in the LAC countries. 4 Countries with high HIV/AIDS spending have b). Argentina, one of the highest spenders per DALY in LAC, also has one of the lowest HIV burdens ( figure 6.8, panel a). Beyond LAC, is possible to find countries that spend less than an even lower HIV/AIDS burden ( figure 6.8, panel b). In LAC, Argentina spends the most per AIDS death and has the second largest expenditure on HIV/AIDS per person living with HIV after Barbados ( figure 6.9, panel a). Countries with high domestic spending per person living with HIV have fewer than countries with low domestic spending ( figure 6.9, is between HIV/AIDS spend- ing and deaths caused by AIDS in the region (i.e., low levels domestic figure b).

Since in Argentina treatment and prevention for HIV/AIDS are provided free of charge, and the program has been mostly independent of international funding since 2009 (0.25 percent of funds) (UNAIDS 2012), the annual funding of the program comes as a fiscal requirement. Hence, it is important to calculate the total treatment, and care are free at present, cost recovery options should be considered. The basic principle behind user charges is that users should pay the economic cost of services (i.e., treatment and care). The appropriate cost for users is, at most, the marginal cost of providing the service, with no profits being generated from the HIV/AIDS program. However, the government can regulate or set charges so that user fees only cover part of the costs by limiting free treatment and care to those in most financial need or subsidizing treatment for all.

To gain a better understanding of section estimates the costs of HIV/AIDS treatment for the next six years. The analysis considers only the costs of treatment and care, because they accounted for 77 percent of the total budget for the HIV/AIDS program in 2009 and 80 percent of the total budget for the program in 2012 ( UNAIDS 2011 ). In 2012, total HIV domestic spending was US$285.95 million and 80 percent of the funds were allocated toward treatment and care.

To calculate future HIV incidence and AIDS deaths, we use information from the 2013 AIDS Bulletin and United Nations population growth estimation data AIDS deaths, assum-ing growth rate over time. 6 There were 32,442 registered HIV cases until 2000 ( MSN 2008 ) and 63,453 HIV cases from 2001 to 2011, for a total of 95,895 registered HIV cases in Argentina. There were registered first HIV that HIV patients only died because of AIDS, there are at most 66,435 registered people with HIV alive in Argentina. 7 However, the Argentine government estimates that there were 110,000 PLWHA 2013 2013 ).

Conclusion Argentina had the third highest expenditures on HIV/AIDS per DALY in the region after Chile and Cuba in 2009-11. Although the average HIV/AIDS expenditure per DALY in LAC between 2009 and 2011 was US$1,052, in Argentina it was three times higher, at US$3,178. Furthermore, Argentina's total domestic 2006, making the country's spending the third highest in the region after Mexico and Brazil. In 2012, total domestic HIV spending was slightly less, allocates HIV funds in a similar manner to the LAC region, where treatment and care in Argentina represents 80 percent of total HIV spending (75 percent in LAC). Moreover, a wide variation in ART cost in LAC is associ-ated with the unit price of tenoforiv/emtricitabine. Argentina has one of the highest costs of the fixed-dose combination (four times two-tablet per DALY is three times higher than for LAC as a whole. Since a high portion of HIV spending is allocated to treatment and given the wide variation ARV among LAC and international organizations such as the World Bank, WHO, and PAHO may have a crucial role to play in supporting countries to reach more competitive prices for ART at the level. It is also important to maintain strict monitoring of inputs of Argentina's found that Argentina has one of the lowest burdens in the region. Some countries spend more than Argentina and have even lower HIV/AIDS burdens, reinforcing the negative relation between the cost per DALY and the HIV/AIDS burden found in the LAC region. Nonetheless, some other countries have lower burdens of HIV and expenditures, the similar HIV/AIDS burdens. Some countries spend more than Argentina and have more DALYs per 100,000; others spend less and have 100,000. Thus, although Argentina's spending is comparatively high, it is Switzerland, that had a significant reduction in HIV/AIDS burden to 2010 while relatively HIV/AIDS burden in 2010. We analyzed whether the HIV/AIDS program in Argentina will remain viable over time. We estimated the costs of HIV/AIDS treatment for the next six years 140 Is Argentina Spending Too Much on Its HIV/AIDS Progr am?

We found that treatment 83.3 same. If the government's estimations are correct, there were 110,000 people living with HIV in 2013. If this number is indeed stable, as mentioned in the latest HIV Bulletin, it represents 17 percent more HIV-positive people in need of treatment, making the future financial need even greater. We also assumed stable cost per patient per year over time, which may not be a likely scenario. Although HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care are free in Argentina at the present time, it is important to consider whether some cost recovery would be possible. that Despite economies with similar HIV burdens (in and outside the LAC region), Argentina could further reduce its HIV burden by spending more in cost-efficient manner. a in the costs and consequences of alternative interven-tions are expressed in cost per unit of health outcome. CEA is used to determine technical efficiency in given budget) ( National Institutes of Health 2013) . The CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio in which the denomina- tor is the gain in health\u2014in this case, DALYs\u2014and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain ( Gold and others 1996 ). The transformation of outputs into health outcomes poses the greatest chal- lenge when developing a CEA. On the one hand, detailed information on the costs (variable and fixed) of the different HIV-related programs is needed. On the other hand, it is difficult to estimate and independently assess the health outcome of program (i.e., link causation) with a comparable measurement (such as change in DALYs per 100,000 people), because the correlations among programs. For example, DALYs because of prevention while holding other interventions, such as treatment and care, constant. To overcome these challenges, we suggest the use of a dynamic, compartmental mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progres-sion to effective meet the objectives set by various stakeholders.

Between 1990 and 2000, there was a 164 percent increase in the HIV/AIDS burden in Argentina. 2 At the peak of the epidemic, in 2000, HIV/AIDS accounted and per 100,000 people), followed by a 21 percent decrease between 2000 and 2010 ( figure 7.1). In 1990, as described in the first the Argentine government declared its commitment to fighting the adoption of the National AIDS Law 23798. In 1997, the National HIV/AIDS Program began to expand significantly, introducing a comprehensive set of six key delivery solutions: (a) universal access to modern antiretroviral treatment (ART); as health education at schools to reduce the negative impacts of social determinants on health; (c) online supply and medicine tracking and monitoring system; and (f) social mobilizations and enactment of laws that protect people living with HIV/AIDS to create a legal human rights framework for preventing and fighting AIDS, including the 2010 law allowing same-sex marriage and the 2012 Gender Identity Law. 3 Over the past five years, the government has improved and innovated the HIV/AIDS program by adding two service solutions: (a) an online monitoring 144 Cost-Benefit Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7system that tracks efficient use and HIV/AIDS medicines supplies, and services. a result of these efforts, Argentina reduced HIV incidence by 25 percent and attained control over the epidemic ( National Ministry 2012 the HIV/AIDS BoD in Argentina decreased 21 2010 (a to 14,467 constituting South America during that time-frame, after Peru (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [ IHME] 2013 ). In 2000, Peru had an HIV/AIDS BoD 2.8 times higher than Argentina (794 com-pared with 284 DALYs per 100,000 people), which likely contributed to a sharper decline. Similar to infant mortality, the lower the burden is, the more difficult it is to reduce further burden of ( figure 7.2 4 Although Chile still America, its HIV/AIDS BoD increased analyzed.

CBA involves a process that is developed in the next two subsections: (a) estimation of the benefits derived from the reduction the HIV/AIDS burden between 2001 and 2010, using DALYs as the unit of measure, multiplied by the price of a DALY; and (b) estimation of the costs using data from the Ministry of Health of Argentina (MSN) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Estimation of Benefits To equation, we must find the monetary value of the change in the HIV/AIDS burden between 2001 and 2010, which is mea-sured in DALYs. Conducting a health-related calculation benefits. In three methods that can be used to calculate the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS: (a) individuals' value, (b) productive capacity, and (c) implicit value. After obtaining the price of a DALY from we estimate the num- have happened in the absence of a programmatic intervention and the actual values of total DALYs from HIV/AIDS. Price of a DAL Y As ethical concerns make it impossible to put a standard value on a human life, we calculate the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL), a statistical term used in cir-cumstances of saving lives as opposed to taking lives or \"producing\" lives. VSL is the value that individuals place on a marginal change in their likelihood of death. We consider three methods to estimate the value of a human life, as described by Card and Mooney (1977) . Individuals' Value Some that the value of a life should be self-determined. In that case, the VSL is estimated by simply asking people how much they would be willing to pay for a reduction in the likelihood of death, perhaps by purchasing safety improve-ments. These types to overstate valuation services, making it very difficult to obtain accurate information for determining 148 Cost-Benefit Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7the price of a DALY. Therefore, in this specific case, the individuals' value approach calculated based on the productive contributions an individual makes to society, equated to his or her earnings. The average societal production capacity can be equated to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at the higher end and to the yearly minimum salary and average personal consumption expenditure as a proxy for disposable income at the lower end. Table 7.1 presents a simple average of the value of these options for Africa, LAC, and Argentina. General Implicit Value This method operates lives. estimated by observing the risks people are volun-tarily willing to take and how much they pay for taking them. These types of studies, which look at people's actual choices, are values of a life distributed about a mean. Then, it is possible to estimate how much money is spent on a particular disease and divide that by the number of DALYs. Table 7.2 presents average public spending on HIV per DALY from UNAIDS and the average amount of grants committed for HIV/AIDS by the Global Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM).

Cost-Benefit Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina 149 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 The the revealed approach estimate the price of DALY, taking into account grant decisions made by GFATM, 5 which channels 82 percent of the international financing for tuberculosis, 50 percent for malaria, and 21 percent for AIDS. By the of 2013, (GFATM). Using information from GFATM, Brent (2011) calculated that the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS in 2005 in Africa was US$11,871. We replicated that method for LAC to estimate the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS in Argentina. According to Brent's theory, the price of a DALY is equal to: = = PU D U YDi iD Y where U = G i = b0 + bD D i + bY Y i + bZ Z i + ei and equal to the expenditure deci- sions for price function is three variables measured in per capita terms ( Brent 2011 ). programs and the magnitude of impact a grant can make in that country. Continued with large HIV epidemic may not always obtain comparable grants if they are unable to demonstrate the results that were or will be achieved with that money. In this way, the dependent variable is equal to the total grant amount com- mitted by GFATM to each country over the past 10 years in per capita terms. Since this methodology is guided by GFATM principles, it is important to note that we base calculations on commitments and not on disbursements, which can differ for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we use the cumulative total grant amount committed for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria through 2013 as the dependent variable, for which data are available for 49 African countries and 22 countries in the LAC region. To obtain the estimated price of a DALY based on income, both DALY and income must appear as independent variables in the estimation equation (i.e., D i and Y i respectively). measured in purchasing power parity international Y i is expressed in the same currency unit for all countries. To complete the specifications of the independent variables, Z i equals public spending on HIV using data from UNAIDS for each country in per capita terms. These individual expenditures are thus treated as proxies for determin-ing whether dealing with HIV/AIDS epidemic. 150 Cost-Benefit Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 In the following analysis, we use information gathered from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk (IMF), GFATM, and UNAIDS. We use data from for all independent variables and accumulated grants committed until 2013 as the the variables used to estimate the value of a DALY (i.e., grants approved for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis, D i , Y i , and Z i , respectively). We present information for Africa, LAC, and Argentina ( Brent 2011 ). The burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina, measured as DALYs per capita, is five times lower than the regional average and 31 times lower than the African average. Nonetheless, while international funds for HIV/AIDS represent 0.25 percent of total expenditures in Argentina, these are approximately 46 percent of total expenditures in Africa and 13 percent in LAC. Public spend-ing on HIV per DALY from HIV is 19 times greater in Argentina than in Africa and about four times greater than the LAC regional average. Following Brent's (2011) methodology, we run an ordinary least squares (OLS) calculation to estimate the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS. Since we use grant commitment data from GFATM up to 2013 and the data on all the independent variables are measured as of 2010 or earlier, the OLS estimation technique is suitable in this case. We present the estimations for the price of HIV for Africa and LAC in table 7.4 . Since we use a per capita measure, the estimated price of a DALY is Table 7.3 Summary Statistics Statistic Africa LAC Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; HDI = Human Development Index; IMF International Monetary Fund; PPP = purchasing = Joint Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Cost-Benefit Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina 151 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7also in per capita this value, we multiply the initial estimated price of a DALY by DALY from HIV per capita. The results show that the value of an average DALY in LAC is US$9,557, which is almost half the estimated price in Africa. The difference in the esti-mation of this implicit value of a DALY between LAC and Africa may be because of two fundamental differences in the calculation of the dependent variable: (a) The percentage of HIV spending that comes from GFATM is almost twice as large in Africa as in LAC. (b) The DALY per capita caused by HIV is six times higher in Africa than in LAC. In both cases, the estimated coefficient of D i is statistically significant at the one percent level and the coefficient of Y i is negative, as expected (i.e., the richer the country is, the fewer international funds it receives). The regressions were based on data from 37 African countries and 14 LAC countries; some observa-tions may have been lost because of missing data. Regarding the implicit value calculations, it is important to clarify that for GDP and public spending on HIV/AIDS (i.e., variables). dependent domestic product; Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; PPP = purchasing power parity; UNAIDS = Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. ** p < 0.5, *** p < 0.01. 152 Cost-Benefit Analysis of the HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7price accounts for cumulative commitments since for each country including Argentina, which received some compare values with what would have happened in the absence of any interventions. To do so, it is necessary to predict the of using differ-ent trends simulate first two stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as pre-sented by Levin, Bull, and Steward (2001) . The two stages are as follows: (a) during the first years of contact between HIV and a human population, the epidemic is driven by early transmissions that possibly occur before donors sero-convert to HIV-positive status; and (b) any given subpopulation may decline or stabilize the susceptible hosts rather than because of the natural evolution of the virus or the efficacy of public health measures. The first trend we construct shows what would have happened if the HIV/AIDS pandemic had remained in the first stage (i.e., high rate of attack and expansion of the epidemic without any intervention). We use data from 1990 to 1995, when the increasing rate was 12,011 DALYs per year (Delta 1). We calcu-late the logarithmic growth rate for the first trend. The second trend shows the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 (i.e., lower rate of attack, first interventions implemented, 1997). We use data from 1995 to 2000, when the BoD increased by 1,923 DALYs per year (Delta 2). Finally, a third trend simulates the second stage when there is complete saturation or stabilization of the epidemic, assum-ing that no additional interventions took place. The increasing rate in this case (Delta 3) was calculated so that the rate of decline from the first to the second trend is equal to that from the second to the third trend, as follows: = Delta Delta DeltaDelta Delta Delta(2 1 ) 1(3 ) 2 by 308 DALYs per year. Figure 7.3 , panel a, shows the total number of DALYs, deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) in Argentina between 1990 and 2010. Three clear trends can be identified: (a) rapid expansion of the epidemic before 1995, (b) decline in expansion of the epidemic between 1995 and 2000, and (c) decline in burden of HIV after 2000\u2014the data point that is closest in time to the start of large-scale HIV interventions in Argentina. Figure 7.3 , panel b, shows the three trend lines calculated with predicted values for DALYs. Hereafter, we will refer to these trends as cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

These ratios are similar to estimated returns on investment in health for low-income countries ( Jamison and others 2013 ) and are consistent with the visual analysis. In the case 3, we obtain a net cost using the price of a DALY and the net benefit using GDP per capita, with benefit-to-cost HIV/AIDS health pro- grams implemented in Argentina during the past decade had an overall net benefit. Conclusion As a result of the implementation and expansion of a comprehensive and evidence-based program to reduce the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Argentina, which includes state of the art universal access to treatment, prevention, and health surveillance, the HIV/AIDS burden has declined by 21 percent in Argentina since 1997. This reduction is the second highest in South America and is estimated to have saved 4,379 lives during the past decade under a con-servative scenario (case 2), 22,324 lives under case 1, and 2,258 lives under case 3. Although Argentina's expenditures on HIV/AIDS per DALY were the third highest in the region, our calculations show the state saved more than US$748 million from to 2010 in addition to potentially preventing 236,044 DALYs scenario ( table 7.5 , case 2). 8 this chapter was to assess between and 2010 outweigh the total costs of the HIV/AIDS program during the same period of time. We conducted a CBA to determine whether Argentina's level of expenditure is consistent should current HIV/AIDS program.

For the productive capacity method, we used Argentina's GDP per capita as the price of a DALY. For the implicit value method, we estimated the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS for LAC using the methodology presented by Brent (2011) . After obtaining the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS using these methods, we estimated the scenarios allow compare what in the absence of a pro-grammatic intervention during the time period in Argentina with the actual values of total DALYs from HIV/AIDS. The results show a net benefit when using GDP per capita as the value of a DALY under the three counterfactuals considered. This results in a benefit-to-cost ratio of 9.6 for case 1, 1.74 for case 2, and 1.09 for case 3. When using the implicit value method to calculate the price of a DALY from HIV/AIDS in LAC, we obtain a net benefit in the first two cases and a net cost in the last case. The benefit-to-cost ratios are 5.71 for case 1, 1.03 for case 2, and 0.65 for case 3 ( table 7.7) . The first case (i.e., high rate of attack) likely overestimates the benefits for two reasons: (a) there was possible underreporting before the implementation of the HIV/AIDS program in Argentina; and (b) it is unlikely that DALYs from HIV in Argentina would have continued growing at the same high rate because implicit epidemiological saturation of cases since Argentina had a concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemic, which is not the case in other parts of the world. The third case (i.e., complete saturation of the epi-demic) likely underestimates the benefits, since it is unlikely that the HIV would reached complete saturation in the affected population in such a short period of time in the absence of interventions ( MSN 2012 , 2013 ). The second case (i.e., lower rate of attack) presents a counterfactual that is clos-est to a natural evolution of the HIV/AIDS trend given no interventions, and includes a lower rate of attack because of the partial saturation of the epidemic. As the in Argentina were worthwhile, since the present value of all benefits exceeds the present value of all costs under the scenarios analyzed. In particular, the CBA for case 2 shows evidence that the country should maintain and expand the National programmatic to reduce the epidemic, especially with the introduction of universal access to prevention and treatment, which have the potential to further reduce the HIV/AIDS burden.

HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7 Conclusions Over the past 30 years, HIV/AIDS has joined the selected group of the world's health threats that challenge and will continue to challenge humanity. Almost three decades after the first case of HIV/AIDS, the disease continues to be the fifth leading cause of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). However, the past decade has seen significant efforts to reduce the HIV/AIDS burden in many countries in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, resulting in the highest regional reduction of HIV/AIDS in the world. Although rates are decreasing in LAC, Sub-Saharan Africa, the European Union, and European Free Trade Association countries, the incidence of HIV/AIDS is increasing in the rest of the world. Despite the improvement the LAC region has made, from being the region with the second highest HIV/AIDS burden in the world in 2000 to being the region with the fourth highest HIV/AIDS burden in 2010, the epi-demic remains heterogeneous within LAC. Thirty years after its first case, Argentina is currently among the five countries in LAC with and prevalence rates; HIV incidence decreased 2001 2011. Moreover, the burden of HIV/AIDS in Argentina declined by 21 percent from 2000 to 2010, when it reached the second lowest reduction in burden in South America. Throughout the studies in this report, we have presented a compre- hensive analysis of the HIV/AIDS response in Argentina during the past 30 years, including an analysis of the financial and programmatic policies of the past decade. We presented up-to-date information HIV/AIDS epidemiological policies, and laws implemented response to burden (BoD) comparing economies in and outside LAC, and providing BoD analysis at the subna-tional level to show current provincial differences, inequalities, and trends. We also presented an vices surveys completed by the Argentine government in 2007 and 2011. And an analysis of demand-side factors of HIV/AIDS identified group, leading demand-side risk and demand-side challenges. At the financial level, we conducted an economic and financial analysis of the National HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina and cross-country comparisons of HIV spending performances that explore the viability sustainability of the HIV/AIDS Program over time. Finally, we presented a cost-benefit analysis to assess from the reduction in the burden from 2001 to 2010 outweighed the total costs of Argentina's National HIV/AIDS Program. In following paragraphs, we highlight the key innovations and strengths of the National HIV/AIDS Program, as well as key challenges that are yet to be tackled. Key Advances Argentina is a world leader on HIV/AIDS. In the past 30 years, and particularly during the past 10 years, Argentina has been a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, outperforming several other economies with similar HIV/AIDS outside LAC. Argentina has made continued innovations in the legal frame-work to reduce stigma and improve human rights, as well as innovations in the quality and service delivery of the National HIV/AIDS Program, making it pos-sible to reduced its HIV/AIDS burden in the past 10 years. Argentina has the second lowest HIV/AIDS burden in South America after Chile, with 2.9 percent of the total regional HIV/AIDS DALYs, equivalent to 223 DALYs per 100,000 in 2010. This is less than half the regional average of 519 HIV/AIDS DALYs per 100,000. Colombia, a country with a similar gross domestic product (GDP) and population percent increase in the HIV/AIDS burden from to reduced burden largest reduction in LAC during that time. Between 2000 and 2010, the HIV incidence rate (identified cases) decreased by 25 the mother-to-child vertical transmission rate from 13.7 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 5.2 in 2011, a reduction of almost 62 percent. Currently, there are an people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and approximately 5,500 new HIV cases per year or 15 new cases per day. Argentina and Brazil have provided evidence that universal access to treat- ment with financial protection for the poorest is a key intervention for preven-tion. Over the past 20 years, Argentina has felt the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with HIV cases increasing from 1,000 in 1990 to 4,223 in 1997, and peaking at more than 6,700 new infections per year in 2004. Despite the expo-nential growth of new HIV cases, early financial coverage of antiretroviral treat-ment (ART), beginning in 1997, has been essential in keeping the number of AIDS cases under control. Argentina has shown that free provision of HIV Conclusions 163 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7treatment can help reduce the number of new infections, and Brazil and Argentina have shown that universal access to HIV/AIDS treatment with finan-cial protection from the state to those affected and in need is a key to reducing the HIV/AIDS burden. Argentina nearly achieved universal coverage with 79 percent coverage (universal coverage on HIV/AIDS was defined by the World Health Organization [WHO] as over 80 percent ART coverage). Both countries made an early decision to convert HIV/AIDS access to treatment to a public good, creating evidence of success. Argentina has shown that a comprehensive legal framework for sexual and reproductive rights matters for reducing stigma and discrimination. Although Argentina did not have a sexual and reproductive family health program until 2002, the country has gone from being one of the most backward countries in LAC regarding sexual and reproductive rights to becoming a leader in the field during the past decade. In 2002, the law on Sexual Health and Responsible Parenthood (Law 25673) mandated in primary health centers and the Marriage Equality Law (26618) recognized unions between persons of the same sex. And most recently, in 2012, the Gender Identity Law country (34 percent HIV prevalence among transgender people in Argentina) to change their gender. This new legal frame-work has created a positive environment for human and sexual rights, and built acceptability and a mandate in the society to reduce stigma and discrimination that prevents diverse populations from accessing health services. Argentina has an effective and comprehensive sex education program in schools to improve prevention knowledge among the youth. In 2006, another law (26150) established the creation of the National Comprehensive Sexual Education Program, which is part of the federal and state school curricula across the country and seeks to expand knowledge on safe sexual practices. Since the passage of this law, Argentina implemented a renovated sexual health education program in public schools. Recently, a Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO evaluation showed that Argentine youth have the highest knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention in the region, with 84 percent of young men and 89 percent of young women (ages 15-24) accurately identify-ing prevention methods and major misconceptions about HIV transmission, followed by Chile with 78 and 85 percent of young men and women, respectively. Argentina has transformed the HIV/AIDS health care line. By considering the demand and supply sides, the country has made health care more efficient, of higher quality, and with better governance than it had been before. On the demand side, Argentina developed a comprehensive prevention pol- icy for HIV/AIDS with four key measures: (a) inclusion of sexual and reproduc-tive health education in schools nationwide, (b) media campaigns with national and external financing, (c) use of a 0-800 confidential helpline phone, and (d) widespread distribution of condoms. The data gathered in the study through 164 Conclusions Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7surveys showed a and distribution condoms throughout the country, as well as the installation of fixed delivery points that ensured distribution accessibility. The dis-tribution of jumping from 8,550,780 units distributed in 2007 to 29,841,880 in 2011. The main condom supplier in 2007 was the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM), which funded purchase of approximately 50 percent by the National HIV/AIDS and STDs Office (Direcci\u00f3n de SIDA y ETS [DSyETS]), and 41.2 percent also received condoms from the National Program for Sexual and Reproductive Health. Currently, 81 percent of males used condom during inter-course a partner. There has also been an increase in communication materials, including print as well as audiovisual and other promotional materials. The 34 jurisdictions them had consulted the DSyETS website. On the supply side, Argentina has used surveys for strategic planning and evaluation of the health delivery model. Argentina conducted two surveys of the supply of services, in 2007 and 2011. The use of surveys for evaluating current status and informing strategic planning is a good practice. The comparison study of the results from the supply of services surveys shows that 90 percent of National HIV/AIDS Program heads reported an improvement in the supply of and access to preventive, diagnostic, and health care services for PLWHA between 2007 and 2011. In addition, jurisdictions and providers demonstrated a greater of in the care of PLWHA (such as greater availability of testing service which helped to reduce mother-to-child transmission. Argentina has reduced its mother-to-child transmission rate by 62 percent, from 13.7 per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 5.2 in 2011. This success was possible thanks to (a) a strategic alliance with the safe blood program, creating a comprehensive system for integrated prenatal testing of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, and other diseases, and (b) a strate-gic alliance with the public health surveillance system for the creation of epide-miological monitoring of health events for seropositive pregnant women and to analyze related of RBF by the National HIV/AIDS Program has increased overall systemic accountability and improved program performance. Under the Essential Public Health Functions Project (EPHFP), a package of guaranteed public health services was created with the use of RBF in six public health programs for the Conclusions 165 Thirty Years of the intermediate results were identified as out-puts. In the case of the National HIV/AIDS Program, a third-party external auditor verifies the completion of six outputs prior to authorizing payments to provinces. The use of RBF has since been expanded, and the use of out-puts has been consolidated throughout the country. Online eliminate duplication and boost efficiency. In 2009, the Ministry of Health (MSN) introduced an online monitoring system that tracks the use and distribution of HIV/AIDS sup-plies. The system was designed and accountability. Currently, implementation of the online monitor-ing system has been extended to half the country's provinces. Clinical governance systems have increased the National HIV/AIDS Program developed and implemented a patient system. online requests for authorizations, monitoring of patients' viral load other tests, as well as monitoring of drug regimens and treatment for assessment treatment adherence, and resistance to treatment. All provinces are linked into the system, which, by the end of 2012, included more than 30,000 patients. The HIV monitoring system for patients increased the efficiency of prescription and delivery of ART, as well as patient follow-up. The system is supported by Argentina's National HIV/AIDS Program are higher than the average for LAC, but the program is cost-beneficial and the savings are remark-able. HIV/AIDS expenditures per DALY in Argentina were the third highest in the region after Cuba and Chile (2009-11). Argentina spends US$3,178 per DALY, with domestic spending in 2012 of US$285.95 million, which was less than in 2009 when it was US$287.1 million. of HIV spending showed that Argentina's spending is high, but it the only country among countries with comparable HIV/AIDS spending that had a significant in HIV/AIDS burden to 2010, while relatively low HIV/AIDS burden. A CBA that used GDP per capita as the value of a DALY was done under three counterfactuals (i.e., high rate of attack, low rate of attack, and complete saturation of the epidemic). When the analysis used the implicit value method to calculate the price of a DALY of HIV/AIDS in LAC, a net benefit was obtained in the first two counterfactuals and a net cost in the last. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the government saved more than US$748 million between 2001 and 2010, in addition to preventing as many as 236,044 DALYs over the DALYs likely epidemiological scenario (approximately 440 lives per year). This is a direct consequence of all 166 Conclusions Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7the measures implemented as part of positive strides has made, are still areas that need improvement and upcoming challenges that must be addressed the HIV/AIDS burden and achieve the new goals for universal health coverage defined by the region: 90/90/90 (90 percent of people with HIV diagnosed, 90 of those and 90 treated being virally suppressed). the following, key challenges. Argentina needs to reduce subnational inequalities. From 2001 to 2012, the provinces with the most HIV cases were Buenos Aires, with 42.8 percent of the cases, followed by the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, with 16.7 percent; C\u00f3rdoba, with 7.9 percent; and Santa Fe, with 5.5 percent. At the provincial level, the burden of HIV/AIDS varies from 12 DALYs per 100,000 inhabitants in Catamarca to 433 and 444 per 100,000 in Salta (Northwest region [NOA]) and Tierra del Fuego (Patagonia Region), respectively, with a national average of 194 per 100,000 in 2010. There are two tendencies that should be considered: the increase in incidence and BoD in most provinces, with the exception of Buenos Aires and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, and the continued reduction of BoD and incidence in both provinces. Using current information, there is a need to revisit the focus of reduction in the most affected provinces with a greater burden prevention and treat-ment across all provinces. Knowledge use of condoms is not sufficient as prevention. There is a need to consider other key factors for improving behavioral change. Although young people in Argentina report some of the highest knowledge on HIV prevention in LAC, this knowledge does not seem to be translated into a practice of prevention among young males, given that 41.1 percent of new HIV infections among males between 2010 and 2012 occurred through same-sex intercourse and 47.9 percent through sex with women. Therefore, there is a need for renewed and better targeted HIV prevention efforts. For instance, we found that younger and more educated Argentines are most likely to use condoms when intercourse. Although binge drinking is positively correlated with condom use for men and women, we found that habitual alcohol consump-tion negatively relates to condom use among men (but not among women). Moreover, men are more likely to use condoms with casual partners, although having multiple sexual partners does not reduce the risk of HIV infection. Although individual behavior change is central to improving sexual health, there is a need to address broader social determinants and risk factors of safe sexual behavior, including but not limited to the use of condoms. In this area, further research is needed. In for behavioral interventions to Conclusions 167 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7the social, economic, and behavioral characteristics of the groups at highest risk of HIV infection. Behavioral interventions have shown there is no approach to sexual and reproductive health education that will perfectly the ultimately help to modify social norms to support behavior change and tackle prevention In Argentina, education programs must be adapted toward the more educated groups who are at higher risk of HIV infection. Although Argentina has developed a comprehensive legal framework for reducing stigma and discrimination, there is a need and transsexual Ensuring that there is zero discrimination in health facilities is the first step to combat inequitable access to health services for the priority populations. More research, monitoring, and education of selected needed masculinization The male-to-female ratio of new HIV infections increased from 1.8 in 2001 to 2.0 in 2011. While in many countries the male-to-female ratio of HIV prevalence has been declining over recent years, in Argentina the ratio had a slight increase. This means that HIV has become even more concentrated in the male population. In Argentina, men who have sex with men (MSM) should be considered as the Because the HIV/AIDS epi-demic in Argentina concentrated, it to the epidemiological characteristics of the country's when poli-cies. The priority high-risk group is males ages 25-34 years who are sexually active, have sex with men, have a high school diploma, and are from the central provinces of the country. Moreover, when analyzing the demand-side HIV/AIDS, education is positively correlated with HIV incidence at income Nonetheless, we found no significant correlation between violence and HIV incidence at the provincial level. Specific studies about knowledge, attitudes, and practices in the (young treated as a key pillar of the National HIV/AIDS Program in Argentina, at least from a budgetary perspective, since HIV spending on prevention 168 Conclusions of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7currently represents only 1.2 percent of total HIV spending, after a 30 percent reduction from 2009 to 2012. Prevention should be focused on the priority high-risk group. Argentina needs to improve the treatment of patients in the health delivery chain. Despite the fact that all general hospitals are expected to care for PLWHA, 17 percent of PLWHA are still transferred to other health facilities to receive care, making it difficult to track these patients through the health system or health networks. Other institutional barriers remain, such as The government needs to improve the diagnosis TB and HIV/AIDS patients. Although the number of new and relapse cases of TB in Argentina has remained stable since 2006, the high risk of death from TB among PLWHA makes receiving TB treatment and vice versa. Currently, only a small proportion of people with TB are screened for HIV (11 percent in 2012). Of tested 559 TB-HIV coinfected there is a increase coverage of HIV testing among TB patients, which could lead to an increase of cases of HIV among TB patients. In addition, country requires of HIV/AIDS testing among the general population, but in particular for pregnant women. Although the number of people diagnosed with HIV has increased, there is still a need to improve diagnosis in light of the recent regional 90/90/90 goals. In addition, there is evidence that shows that from 2009 to 2010, 47 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS-positive women were diagnosed in the con-text of pregnancy, underlining the need for early HIV testing among women of all ages. Argentina should revisit the procurement of HIV/AIDS medicines. A wide variation in treatment cost in LAC is associated with the unit price of tenoforiv/emtricitabine, and Argentina has one of the highest costs of the fixed-dose com-bination Argentina's HIV HIV/AIDS per DALY is three times higher than the LAC average. Since a high portion of HIV spending is allocated to treatment, and medicines. organizations a role to play in achieving more competitive prices for ARV treatment at the regional level. It is also important to maintain and expand management of patients, through the implementa-tion of rigorous management systems to track supplies and governance for improvements in and cost containment, all while improv-ing efficiency and effectiveness. In search of sustainability, it is time to be more efficient. Argentina no longer seeks external resources to finance its National HIV/AIDS Program, since the Conclusions 169 Thirty Years of the HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Argentina http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7program has been almost completely funded by national resources since However, Argentina still needs to improve its allocative efficiency National HIV/AIDS Argentina's total domestic HIV spending in 2012 was million, an increase of 65.5 percent since 2006, constituting third largest HIV spending in LAC in absolute terms, after Mexico and Brazil. In this study, we estimated that the government expenditure costs of HIV/AIDS treat-ment will increase 83.3 percent, considering trends similar to those of the past five years in incidence and prevalence. Growth of 83.3 percent in treatment costs will challenge the government to analyze whether it will still be able to cover theses expenses, or whether it will be pos-sible to reduce expenditures on medicines through more strategic procurement, or to use savings made on costs of medicines, for example, to reduce incidence. Should Argentina focus on cost recovery or reducing subsidies? There is a need to analyze potential mechanisms reduce cross subsidies to high-income allow the government to unit costs per patient on ARV costs, or potentially through cost recovery schemes to patients who have the means to pay, under public subsidies. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is needed. The analysis should use a dynamic, compartmental, mathematical model of HIV transmission disease be reduced subnational framework in the country, correcting of an increase in HIV/AIDS in some provinces. The country will face additional costs to increase diagnosis. An estimated 30 percent of people with HIV/AIDS are unaware of their status in Argentina, which implies the need to expand diagnosis and early detection, as well as ART, to the population that has been recently identified. In addition, Argentina could still make effective continue collection schemes that do not infringe on an individual's right to privately seek diagnosis, testing, and care for HIV/AIDS, but that simultaneously provide valuable information for of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.

The CBA can be reduced to a simple formula, where discounted bene-fits are compared against discounted as benefits divided by economic net costs of intervention and it is expressed in relative terms.172 Glossary in http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0596-7Cost-effectiveness analysisA cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is an economic evaluation in which the costs and consequences of alternative interventions are expressed in cost per unit of health outcome.
