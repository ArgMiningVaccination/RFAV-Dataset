Acupuncture for treating hot flashes in breast the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment option for hot flashes in patients with breast cancer, the main focus of this review was not specifically to compare TCA to SA. Instead, the authors reviewed many clinical comparing no treatment. The authors concluded that the evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for the relief of hot flashes in patients that that TCA not produce statistically superior results compared with SA, regardless of was TCA ineffective administered correctly or because SA also an effective treatment. From this perspective, we sought to update and present the state of the art on this particular issue, as SA has been a reliable E, Steineck S. placebo S. of the treatment of chronic daily headache: a sham-controlled clinical trial.

We believe that grouping, updating, and synthesizing the available evidence on this subject can not only guide further research but also support health professionals' decisions regarding the use of complementary therapies for cancer The goal is to enable safe and evidence-based use of these therapies to demystify them. Method The study is a systematic review of the literature, guided by recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration2828. The PICO strategy for the construction acupuncture for the relief of hot menopausal women with published in full up to the present time (July 2014) in English, Portuguese, or Spanish that included adult women (18 years old) with breast cancer and in menopause experiencing hot flashes and that analyzed the effectiveness of symptom. five electronic databases: the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online via PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Database (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS). The search strategy considered search terms related to the population (P), intervention (I), comparison with placebo (C), outcome (O), and study design (RCT). selected each term set with the Boolean connectors AND and OR. The main keywords adopted in the search strategy for the primary studies Neoplasm, Acupuncture, Acupuncture To locate the RCTs, we added a filter after the PICO search strategy that included the following terms: AND Clinical Trial OR Controlled Clinical Trial OR Randomized Controlled Trial. The search was performed at the end of July 2014, and 272 publications were initially found. Study selection To select the studies, two screened the titles identified In cases of doubt or disagreement, a third reviewer was asked to decide whether to include the used the Jadad scale3030.

The final score scale ranges from 0 to 5. Studies that score < 3 are classified as low quality, and studies that score 3 are classified as high quality3030. Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carroll D, Jenkinson C, Reynolds DJ, Gavaghan DJ, et al. Assessing the allocation considered unlikely to have serious problems with the reliability of their results. An uncertain risk of bias raises questions regarding the reliability of the study results, a high risk of seriously weaknesses we used a form that was designed for the present study, which considered the instructions provided by the Cochrane clinical characteristics, intervention in the experimental and control groups, data analysis, and outcomes). The data were extracted from each study by two independent reviewers. Next, all of the selected studies Jadad scale3030. Jadad AR, Moore RA, Carroll D, Jenkinson C, Reynolds DJ, Gavaghan DJ, et al.

The designated acupuncture points were manually manipulated to obtain De Qi, which is at that may radiate along the corresponding meridian. The target acupuncture points in needles were inserted 2- to 3-mm deep at eight points (four bilateral points) far from the TCA points. In study 33333.

Regarding the risk of bias in the selected studies, it was observed that the reliability of the results can be questioned in all studies because of both uncertain risk of bias and high risk of bias. Uncertain risk of bias prominent of (60%), and selective reporting (40%). High risk of bias was present in the following areas: random sequence generation (20%), allocation concealment (20%), blinding of subjects and health care providers (20%), and blinding of outcome evaluators (20%). In general, the areas where low risk of bias was prevalent were allocation concealment (80%), blinding of subjects and health care providers (80%), and random sequence generation (60%). Discussion Based on the interventions used and the acupuncture acts as a complementary therapy to conventional treatment for the control of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer. In the present review, three studies demonstrated that compared with SA, TCA was more effective for reducing the frequency and intensity of hot flashes(88. Deng G, Vickers A, Yeung S, D'Andrea GM, Xiao H, Heerdt AS, et al. Randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of hot in breast cancer patients.

Hervik J, Mj\u00e5land the hot flashes in breast cancer study conducted in South Korea that provided 12 TCA sessions for 10 post-menopausal women with breast cancer undergoing hormonal treatment with tamoxifen(r) or anastrozole(r). That study showed that the frequency of hot flashes was reduced from 9.3 to 1.5 daily episodes (p = 0.007) at the end of the treatment and that the intensity (measured using a VAS from 0 to 10) varied from 2.8 to 1.1 (p = 0.001), Shin IH, Bong JG, Park SH. Acupuncture for the treatment of hot flashes in patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen Med. 2013;19(8):690-6.). study(3737. Borud Neurosci. 2010;157(1-2):57-62.) examined the evidence supporting the effectiveness of TCA for hot flashes induced by menopause and found that TCA is an effective therapy for reducing such symptoms. The same TCA may affect the release of serotonin and beta-endorphins in the central nervous system, therefore influencing stabilizing the thermoregulatory center, hot Borud the emergence of hot flashes: dysfunction of the thermoregulation core, which keeps the body temperature within normal parameters (homeostasis). Women with complaints of hot flashes may have an alteration in this thermoregulation zone, which may be intensified by low levels of body estrogen that lead This review reinforces suggestions that TCA may influence the release of serotonin and is a therapeutic modality for the relief of flashes(11 Morrow PK, DN, Hortobagyi GN. and treatment modalities. Oncologist. 2011;16(11):1658-64.). A recent review literature that TCA improves immune function via the modulation of natural killer (NK) activity.

By to these receptors, -endorphin NK expression NK cell possibly secretion of May Stimulate Anticancer In addition hot flashes, TCA has been shown to be effective in relieving other symptoms in women with breast cancer. A study in the United States examined 51 women with breast cancer to evaluate treatment with aromatase inhibitors. The study compared TCA with SA and found that TCA was more effective than SA for reducing pain (p<0.001). The group undergoing 0.003) lower mean pain intensity score (2.6) compared with the group undergoing six weeks of intervention(1919. Crew KD, Capodice JL, Greenlee H, et al. Randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial of acupuncture for the management of inhibitor-associated joint symptoms the present systematic review suggest that both interventions, i.e., TCA and SA, are beneficial for the treatment of hot flashes because there was a reduction in symptoms, even though there no significant differences the intervention methods(3333.

It also stated that the a Ther 2014;22(4):724-30.). This premise is also study(4242. Azad A, John T. Do randomized acupuncture studies in patients with cancer Oncol. 2013;31(16):2057-8.) that suggests acupuncture involves an interpersonal and between study of the SA group in randomized trials, which should have study groups must be allocated except for the intervention under investigation because other differences could interfere with the study results(4242. Azad A, John T. Do randomized acupuncture studies in patients with cancer Regarding the methods used found that most studies used diaries as a resource for recording the frequency and intensity of hot flashes. A study conducted to examine the methodological issues of hot confounding biases. One source of reliability is the use of a control group to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention(4343. Clin Oncol. 2001;19(23):4280-90.). In the present review, we found that only one study(3535. Bao T, Cai L, Snyder C, Betts K, Tarpinian K, Gould J, et al. Patient-reported outcomes systematic that aimed to assess these effects on the relief of hot flashes in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer after oncologic that these effects lasted up to three months after the intervention with TCA. After treatment with TCA (from 5 to 12 weeks), an average reduction of 43.2% (general reduction for both men and women) in vasomotor symptoms was observed; and after at Hammar ML, Ingvar M, Spetz Holm AC. How long do the effects of acupuncture on hot flashes persist in cancer Care cancer patients with acupuncture for hot flashes. Springer Plus. 2014;3(1):1-6.) followed 61 women with breast cancer two years after the end of treatment with TCA and SA and identified that the effect of the intervention was sustained in the TCA group compared with the SA group. However, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. authors also claimed hot flashes associated with menopause when performed by a qualified and competent professional(4545. cancer patients treated with acupuncture for hot flashes. Springer Plus. 2014;3(1):1-6.). Study limitations Most of the included studies had small sample sizes, were not representative of the population, and did not report on the sample size calculation, may have compromised between in relieving hot flashes. Thus, to minimize type I and type II errors and to increase the accuracy of loss of participants, especially in terms of follow up, which led to selection bias in these studies. Furthermore, the short follow-up time (4 to 12 weeks) may have affected the measurement of some outcomes. Therefore, we suggest that RCTs follow-up times. In addition to methodological limitations, risk found reduces the large-scale a The results of this systematic review provide the following evidence regarding the effectiveness of TCA versus SA for the treatment/relief of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer: - There is no sufficient evidence to affirm the effectiveness of TCA compared with SA for the treatment of hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer; - It is possible to a slight in the effectiveness interventions have et al.
