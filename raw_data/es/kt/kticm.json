It can improve work-life balance, reduce traffic and time spent commuting, and decrease air pollution, all of which can, indirectly, improve physical and mental health. Telework can also have public health and social benefits. Telework settings may fail to meet the occupational safety and health standards available at traditional worksites. Poor physical environment and workplace design inadequate and support can result in musculoskeletal disorders, eye strain and injuries. Working within a digital in physical from co-workers, coupled with outside the direct control of the employer, can result mental health problems and health and well-being teleworking a comprehensive set of measures to provide a healthy and safe work environment, including adequate organization of the work. Governments, employers and workers all have a role in promoting health and safety while teleworking, including ergonomics, mental health and well-being, as defined by the ILO Convention on Occupational Safety and Health, 1981 and the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health for health and safety; workstation, computer and peripheral equipment, and remote ICT support. Occupational health services can ergonomic, and Workers should employers on the these measures, cooperating with their employer and fulfilling their own health and of telework Telework is defined as the use of information and communications technology (ICT) - such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones - for work that is performed outside the employer's premises. This includes work performed from home, a satellite office or another location (1). \"Hybrid\" work refers to a combination of premises. terms unifying characteristics of telework, as outlined International Labour Organization (ILO) technical note COVID-19: Guidance for labour statistics data collection: Defining measuring remote work, telework, work at home and home-based work (2) (), include work that is fully or partly carried out at a location other than the default place of work, and the use of electronic devices such as a computer, tablet or telephone to perform work. Telework affects the degree of control that the employer has over the working environment, and the employer's ability to plan and provide for a healthy and safe work environment. Prevalence of telework The public health and social measures introduced because of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented rapid transition to telework in many sectors and regions around the world. In Europe, for example, the proportion of workers engaged in telework increased from 11% before the pandemic to 48% during it, with about 40% of paid workhours during the COVID-19 pandemic taking place by telework (3, 4). In the region of Latin America and the Caribbean, more than 23 million people transitioned to telework in the second quarter of 2020 (5). Globally, most of the transition example, research conducted during 2020 indicates that 34% of jobs in the United States of America (USA) could plausibly be performed remotely (6). As the use of telework is likely to increase, it is important to employers, potential health impacts of in a manner that balances the needs of workers and organizations. About this document The aim of this document is to provide technical information to employers, teleworkers and worker representatives of safety well-being. It provides practical advice on organizing and carrying out telework in a way that protects and promotes physical and mental health and social well-being, according to the existing World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and ILO standards and guides. 2 Healthy and safe telework This document questions: What are the impacts of telework on the physical and mental health and social well-being of workers and their families? How can employers in a and manner? What the roles and responsibilities of employers in protecting workers' health and safety, and providing a supportive environment for telework? What are the roles and responsibilities of workers and their representatives in protecting and promoting health and safety while teleworking? How can occupational health services and primary health care providers support the health and safety of teleworkers? The methods used for the development of this documents are provided in the Annex. This document was developed based on rapid review of evidence about health impacts of telework, scoping of existing relevant WHO guidelines and ILO norms and standards regarding occupational safety and health, health behaviours and working environment. 3 Health impact of telework Physical health outcomes There is extensive evidence on the impact of prolonged computer work on a number of physical ailments (e.g. musculoskeletal damage and eye strain) in office settings, few studies have specifically assessed the impact of telework. The research has been undertaken on telework has shown both positive and negative impacts on physical health. A review of studies reported that home-based telework is generally seen having a positive effect on their self-reported can lead to problems arising from workstation design and long working hours (7). Two studies reported reductions in blood pressure with teleworking: a academic personnel found that teleworkers had fewer complaints about and a study of workers showed blood pressure to at the office than during telework at home (9). While the telework has recently been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the spread of the virus, it has been also found that some teleworkers have also struggled to continue to work when they are sick, which has been termed sickness presenteeism (10). These studies are preliminary; more research will be needed to determine the true impacts of telework for different workers and over longer periods of time. Mental health outcomes Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telework was often based on individual agreements to better address balance). However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, telework has in some cases been imposed on workers and employers as part of public health and social measures, resulting in a potential mismatch with a hours reported risk for depression among those who teleworked compared with those who did not telework (22). Research conducted in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic reported that participants working from home more quality time with pets and family members, although working from the office provided more opportunities to socialize and led to less conflict between work and family (19). A Spanish study conducted during COVID-19 home confinement demonstrated that not teleworking contributed to a better occupational balance, a balance of engagement in occupation that leads to well-being (23). 4 Healthy safe telework A review of studies found that telework was associated with more conflict between work and family than traditional 9 to 5 schedules, and that such conflict was higher when work demands were high (24). A study conducted in Japan at a time when telework was expanding because of the COVID-19 A study of employee showed a relationship between telework and lower health risks for alcohol abuse, tobacco use and obesity, with the varying A was associated with 71% higher odds of achieving 30 minutes or more of physical activity per day when compared with non-telework workdays (26). A study of employees teleworking of COVID-19 found frequency of physical activity carried out during this period and a change in the type of activity, with a preference for strength training and stretching exercises (27). A study of adults in the USA showed that those who worked from home spent more time on food preparation or consumption than those who worked away from home (28). The findings suggest that working from home may provide more time to prepare and consume food, possibly yielding health benefits because than food bought in or the Protecting and promoting health, safety and well-being while teleworking 1 This is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system. It applies theory, principles, data and methods to the design of work to optimize human well-being and overall systems performance.Physical environment and ergonomics workers in telework, they may face increased in relation to the physical environment and to as human factors/ergonomics1) because home settings often do not meet the same occupational safety and health standards as traditional worksites. The physical environment may present hygiene and air quality. Creating a good ergonomic environment for computer workers by providing an ergonomic chair, a large screen, a keyboard and mouse, adjustable or flexible workstations and training can minimize musculoskeletal and eye discomfort, promote inadequate set-up of the equipment available to the worker (e.g. ICT equipment, desk, chair and internet connection) can present health and safety risks (31). A poorly positioned set-up strain; it can also create mental health risks if it contributes to with their degree of control, employers should ensure that, as far as reasonably telework (32), in particular is performed on a regular basis. The following action points may be considered while setting up a telework station. They a dedicated workspace is private, quiet and secure. A workstation \"comfort zone\" can be created by arranging the computer monitor and input devices so that they are close to the person's body, allowing a station and detachable keyboard. A well-designed ergonomic office chair is a critical of the teleworker's home office. If used for full-time office and computer work, common household chairs can eventually create problems because of the lack of and and seat pan that has an appropriate width and length, so it fits the worker Healthy and safe telework Ergonomic checkpoints, published by the ILO and International Ergonomics Association, provides practical solutions for improving safety, health and working conditions from an ergonomic point of view (33). The ILO has also developed an Ergonomics checkpoints application (for workplaces. The app includes best practice recommendations for taking action and implementing effective improvements in ergonomics in the workplace (34). When up a computer workstation layout, the work surface should be large enough to ensure the proper placement of the monitor, keyboard and mouse, along with a document holder. When using a laptop, it is worth considering an external keyboard and monitor to allow for the monitor to be at the proper height for viewing, to or mousing, the worker should keep wrists straight, avoid positioning the wrists at an exaggerated angle or in a position that causes tension in the wrists. A palm rest (sometimes called a wrist rest) can provide support during to during moving the mouse. hands should be free to move when typing and should not be anchored or resting on a palm rest, table or thighs while typing. The fingers should be relaxed and nonrigid when operating a laptop or an input device, to reduce strain to the finger joints. Resting the palms while typing may be harmful because it can cause the person to bend and hold their wrists and fingers back, or it can apply pressure to the underside of the wrists. If a smartphone or tablet is used, its height should be raised to eye level or slightly below (e.g. by placing the device on a stack of or magazines). used needs to type text into a smartphone or tablet for a long time (35). Visual strain and eye fatigue can be reduced by positioning to overhead baffles can be used to redirect the source of any glare). To reduce eye strain from fixation on the screen, teleworkers should be encouraged to regularly focus on far objects and then rest the eyes (36). Risks of slips, trips and falls should be reduced by managing cables and placing them away from any walking areas, and by keeping the workspace organized and tidy. Electrical equipment be adequate to maintain the worker's normal level of job performance and safety in the home environment. Ambient noise level should be kept as low as possible and the use of safe listing devices checkpoints by the ILO and International Ergonomics Association, provides practical solutions for improving safety, health and working conditions from an ergonomic point of view (33) . The ILO has also developed an Ergonomics checkpoints application workplaces. The app includes best practice recommendations for taking action and implementing effective Varying computing postures and reduce the impact of sedentary prolonged sitting, and the static loads (i.e. stress caused by sitting or standing in one place for a prolonged period) and fatigue associated with computer work. If possible, teleworkers should be able to move through a variety sitting and standing postures to promote healthy work habits and Workers should be encouraged to change postures and take short breaks throughout the day to move. There are benefits trained on how properly adjust and use sit-stand avoid musculoskeletal symptoms (30). Integrating routine breaks daily work regimen and providing ergonomic reminders via wearable or software the recommended strategies (i.e. how to optimally set up and adjust a workstation to obtain various comfortable computing postures, habits and vary postures throughout working This training can be supported tele-ergonomics evaluation and surveillance implementation of corrective actions. Online and training on how to manage boundaries around work-life balance and simultaneous demands from work and family will help workers to gain a better sense of control and reduce stress, and will improve work performance. Psychosocial risk factors and carried out properly, telework can be beneficial for mental health and social well-being. It can improve work-life balance, reduce time spent on commuting to the workplace, and offer opportunities for flexible work arrangements, all of which may promote mental health and social Telework may present risks for psychosocial well-being, including pace, work-life balance, isolation and detachment. There The psychosocial impact on and family may be compounded in situations when the worker does not have access to a private, quiet and dedicated workstation. Communication can be challenging during telework, because it is limited to ICT channels with little or no face-to-face communication and can be limited by the bandwidth of the internet connection. Difficulties related to communication may make it difficult for workers to understand the task at hand, resulting in stress. Some workers may feel the effects of social or professional isolation, owing to decreased communication their of using open communication that the sharing of information (38) workers may experience sometimes working long hours or late into the night. If the set work times are not well established between workers and their managers, resulting in difficulty disconnecting from work and managing the work schedule.). This is exacerbated when a company works across multiple time zones. Employees working from home tend to work longer hours than when they are working at the premises of the employer, in part because the time to commute to the workplace 8 Healthy in routines and the blurring of the boundaries between paid work and personal life (1). Because telework relies heavily on ICT home, tension among family members or violence, and provide information about relevant resources and support for victims. The following action points may be considered to keep to a regular schedule, to ensure they do not to work an excessive number of hours. Timers and hour logs can help workers track their hours and stay within a healthy work schedule, but such tools must be confidential, and workers should not feel they are being monitored dedicated social time before and after meetings) may informal chats. Employers should provide teleworkers with ICT tools and software that will help them to connect efficiently with co-workers and managers. Regular communication with managers and peers about current happenings, sharing of information and problem-solving important for employers and managers to be aware of the number of online meetings employees during short telework, the early symptoms of mental ill health, and how and where they can access psychosocial and mental health supports. Teleworkers should be trained on work behaviour and digital etiquette while interacting with colleagues, and on how to identify respond abuse or bullying.9 Technical brief Work health and well-being. When telework is carried out in private homes and other premises outside the direct control of the employer, it may difficult to enforce the established workplace on tobacco smoking, of and Work-life balance may be affected as workers are faced with family duties, especially if young children or other family members are at home during working hours. Respecting boundaries between work and personal time can reduce psychosocial stressors and enhance worker performance. For many adults, the workplace is a key setting for being physically active and reducing sedentary behaviour. The trip to and from work, programmes behaviours while teleworking (42). The boundaries for work and personal time, to ensure that they maintain a routine the opportunity for workers to have flexibility and control of their schedules, to manage the competing demands of work and Excess screen time irregular workhours during maintain a regular schedule and refrain from screen time and work duties before sleep. Electronic devices can be set to have reminders for the worker to turn off the device before sleep. Workers and employers should work challenging during periods of telework because the long hours of sedentary work, the worker's routine can be set up to include times for physical activity; for example, by scheduling a recreational physical activity, WHO be to enable people with and limits intake of free sugars to 10% of energy intake and total fat to less than 30% of total energy intake is important for maintaining health. Workers can be Healthy telework to plan regular or water and avoid processed food and drinks with added sugar. WHO and the ILO recommend that all workplaces should be free from tobacco smoke (46, 47) . Employers can convey to programmes. can also remind those working at home that during working hours they are expected to comply with the workplace drug and alcohol policies. It may be helpful to information remote work-from-home policy, in accordance with the ILO's code of practice (48). All health information should be accessible, understandable and realistic, taking into of employers, workers and governments The Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 181 (No 155) (49) and its accompanying Recommendation (No. 164) (50) describe the responsibilities and rights of employers and workers, and the role of governments to ensure the right to safe and healthy working environments. At the national level, these standards define the obligation of ratifying Member States to formulate, implement and periodically review with the most representative organizations of employers and workers - a national policy on occupational safety and health that defines the functions and responsibilities of public authorities, employers, workers Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Convention, 2006 (No 187) (51), countries should also establish a national system (Article 4) providing the main framework for implementing the national policy, and a programme defining a time frame, priorities and means of action for the improvement (Article 5). At the workplace level, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Convention (49), employers ensure that, far as reasonably practicable, workplaces, machinery, equipment and processes under their control are safe and without risk to health (Article 16). In performing their work, workers should cooperate in fulfilling the obligation upon 19, a). There should also representatives all matters related to occupational safety and health. Cooperation between management and workers or their representatives is essential for the success of any approach to secure the health of teleworkers. The definition of a workplace in the Occupational Safety and Health Convention (49) includes \"all places where workers need to be or to go by reason of their work and which are under the direct or indirect control of the employer\" (Article 3, c) and defines health in relation to work as \"not merely the absence of disease or infirmity; it also includes the physical and mental elements affecting health which are directly related to safety and hygiene at work\" (Article 3, e). Sound management systems for occupational safety and health at the enterprise level contribute to and healthy working environments, with occupational elimination, substitution, relation with each and with their representatives over safety and health issues while teleworking. Organizations and managers can have in designing telework that promotes worker well- being (53). To reduce the risks associated with the physical environment and ergonomics, employers should that workers receive adequate of the job. For workers with physical disability, provision of equipment, tools and training to modify the telework environment should be planned in consultation with the workers and their representatives, in line with the ILO Code of Practice on Managing Disability in the recommendations, along with training on how to adjust the physical environment and how best to place (arrange) the computer and office equipment to reduce such and health promotion. This training should cover how to mitigate risk and respond to and Employers clear direction on maintaining confidential company information, enable security measures for workers working from home, and establish telework policies and procedures to support working from home (e.g., purchasing of equipment, technology including software, office furniture and supplies). ICT support and services (e.g., for telephone, internet and equipment) should be provided, and teleworkers should be informed of this. Legal issues regarding equipment and maintenance contracts and insurance (e.g., workers' compensation, homeowners' insurance and disability insurance) may be an understanding between workers and employers regarding hours of being in boundaries others in their household (56). Teleworkers must be provided with regular working hours and rest periods. International and national norms concerning regular working hours and Working time should be as flexible as possible. The Hours of Work (Commerce and Offices) Convention, 1930 (No 30) (57) established daily and weekly working hour limits Fig. 1: connectivity support Institute policies on telework Worker training Practice regular short breaks Health behaviour counselling Social interactions with coworkers13 Technical brief for commercial and office workers (i.e. 8 hours per day and 48 hours per week), which could be applicable to teleworkers. The Weekly Rest (Commerce and Offices) Convention, 1957 (No 106) (58) provides for an uninterrupted weekly rest period comprising not less than 24 hours in the course of each period of 7 days, which may also apply to teleworkers. The European Union Framework Agreement on Telework (2002) (59) established a general framework on the rules regarding telework; the aim was to promote such work while ensuring that it met the and employers. agreement the employer's employment conditions, data protection, privacy, equipment, health and safety, organization of work, training and collective rights). The pressure that teleworkers often feel pressured to constantly \"connected\" to their employer and co-workers can lead to many of the negative consequences of telework (e.g. longer working hours and tension in balancing paid work and personal life commitments). Hence, in \"the right to disconnect\" has been established, meaning that the worker has the right to disengage from work and refrain from engaging in work-related electronic communications (e.g. non-workhours. In other countries, existing time regulations with all relevant working time issues in general terms, and no additional laws have been introduced. In many countries where the right to disconnect has been established, the right to disconnect is meant for all workers, including office workers (who may be reached outside of office hours) and teleworkers. The right to disconnect can be also viewed as a way to limit working hours and ensure workers can get proper rest between work days. Therefore, it is important to organize telework to meet the needs of both workers and the organization; this requires a on emphasis is placed software that monitors computer usage or activates constant online video capabilities. Such measures reduce trust and may increase priorities; agreeing on a common system to signal availability for work and ensuring that managers and colleagues respect the system; encouraging workers to share when they are feeling overloaded, to serve as an early warning system to detect the risk of burnout, and know when tasks or team members should be reassigned; The European Union Framework Agreement on Telework (2002) (59) established a general framework on the rules regarding telework; the aim was to promote such work while ensuring that it met the and employers. agreement the employer's employment conditions, data protection, privacy, equipment, health and safety, organization of work, training and collective rights). 14 Healthy that and managers understand when task is completed satisfactorily, with the provision of positive feedback, when timely, regular constructive feedback to workers, describing what the workers did, and focusing on changes that will result in the most significant improvement to the task and will have the expected impact. 15 Roles of occupational health and moving to telework, occupational health services - as defined by the Occupational Health Services Convention, 1985 (No 161) (60) -need to expand their delivery channels. New channels could include online consultations, mobile applications and checklists to conduct risk assessments, online evaluation of worker health, digital tools for mental health and psychosocial support, and tele-ergonomic assessments workers and services. Teleworkers should be educated by occupational health staff, national health and safety authorities, or other appropriate persons on the potential risks to physical and mental health and introduced. Referral according low high or low demands, harassment by managers or colleagues, stressors (e.g., child elder care, and domestic violence). Regular screening of teleworkers for health outcomes depressive symptoms, isolation, the relevant health authorities is an important way to track the incidence of occupational health outcomes and monitor the efficacy of interventions. and arising out of telework, be less likely positive physical and mental health and social well-being. However, when the health and safety risks of negative on health. The general principles embedded in the Occupational Safety and Health Convention (49) - that is, the need to assess and manage risks, and the hierarchy of controls Current trends suggest that telework will continue to grow as an integral part of the world of work. By mitigating physical and mental health risk factors, and promoting safe, regardless of where they conduct their work. 17 References 1. Eurofound and the International Labour Office.
