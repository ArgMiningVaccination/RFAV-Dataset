Mar\u00eda Cristina Carrillo, Presidenta SAIC Estimados Miembros de la Comunidad Cient\u00edfica del \u00e1rea Biom\u00e9dica: Les doy la bienvenida, en nombre de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, a la LXV Reuni\u00f3n Anual, que este a\u00f1o se lleva a cabo de manera conjunta con la Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda y la Sociedad Argentina de Fisiolog\u00eda. En 2020, SAIC cumple 60 a\u00f1os. Durante estas 6 d\u00e9cadas, los trabajadores de la ciencia que han transitado y que transitan la Sociedad han hecho realidad lo que John Ruskin alguna vez cit\u00f3: \" El trabajo de la ciencia es sustituir apa - riencias por hechos e impresiones por demostraciones\". Durante 60 a\u00f1os la sociedad funcion\u00f3 teniendo como meta principal la realizaci\u00f3n de Reuniones Cient\u00edficas en donde pudieran confluir las teor\u00edas m\u00e1s novedosas, los dilemas m\u00e1s excitantes y las resoluciones cient\u00edficas m\u00e1s sorpren - dentes. Durante su existencia se produjeron acontecimientos pol\u00edticos y sociales que introdujeron importantes avances, pero tambi\u00e9n significativos retrocesos en el sistema cient\u00edfico y acad\u00e9mico. En l\u00edneas generales, podemos decir que en Argentina, hist\u00f3ricamente, no existieron procesos concretos de inte - graci\u00f3n de universidades, instituciones p\u00fablicas de I+D y empresas privadas promovidos por una red o urdimbre de actores de instrumentaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9rica, tal como los que se encuentran en las econom\u00edas desarrolladas. La ausencia de esta trama institucional motiv\u00f3 que se fueran incrementando, a lo largo de los a\u00f1os, formas de inte - graci\u00f3n subordinadas, al, por ejemplo, estandarizar la compra de instrumentos al exterior para equipar los laboratorios y al desarrollar una valoraci\u00f3n acr\u00edtica de los v\u00ednculos entre cient\u00edficos y grupos locales con grupos e instituciones de pa\u00edses avanzados. Esta situaci\u00f3n ha llevado al complejo de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CyT) a ser funcional, en parte, a los requerimientos de un sistema internacional de estados muy estratificado debido a la globalizaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica que se inici\u00f3 al final de la 2da Guerra Mundial y se profundiz\u00f3 en la d\u00e9cada de los '80. Lo que nos llev\u00f3 a tener un papel subsidiario en el sistema econ\u00f3mico mundial. Podr\u00edamos concluir que los v\u00ednculos de dependencia en CyT son una exteriorizaci\u00f3n fragmentaria de la dependencia cultural y econ\u00f3mica. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esta hist\u00f3rica realidad, tanto la dictadura militar que irrumpi\u00f3 entre 1976 y 1983, como el gobierno de caracter\u00edsticas neoliberales que hegemoniz\u00f3 la d\u00e9cada de los \u00b490, llevaron adelante pol\u00edticas que desarticularon sig - nificativamente la estructura del sistema cient\u00edfico-acad\u00e9mico y sus principales proyectos de desarrollo y condujeron al exilio forzado a miles de investigadores, tecn \u00f3logos y profesores universitarios con un alto nivel de capacitaci\u00f3n. En un contexto de crisis econ\u00f3mica y social sin precedentes, el gobierno que asume en mayo del 2003 se plantea como uno de sus principales objetivos la transformaci\u00f3n del modelo econ\u00f3mico-social del pa\u00eds, orient\u00e1ndolo hacia un crecimiento centrado en la mejora de las capacidades productivas y la reindustrializaci\u00f3n. Esta perspectiva coloc\u00f3 a la educaci\u00f3n, la ciencia y la tecnolog\u00eda como sustentos de la reconstrucci\u00f3n de una sociedad con mayor crecimiento e integraci\u00f3n social. Como resultado de estas pol\u00edticas, en el \u00e1mbito de CyT se produjo el aumento sostenido de la inversi\u00f3n y la incorporaci\u00f3n de un n\u00famero sin precedentes de investigadores, tecn\u00f3logos y becarios al sistema. No menos importante fue el fortalecimiento de una institucionalidad que permiti\u00f3 orientar las prioridades de la investi - gaci\u00f3n a las necesidades del desarrollo productivo del pa\u00eds. La creaci \u00f3n del Ministerio de Ciencia, Te cnolog\u00eda e Inno - vaci\u00f3n Productiva en el a\u00f1o 2007 fue uno de los hitos m\u00e1s significativos de esta etapa. Cabe destacar que, junto con los aspectos virtuosos de este per\u00edodo que, habiendo comenzado en 2003, culmin\u00f3 en 2015, es necesario mencionar un n\u00famero importante de limitaciones y asignaturas pendientes que no se pudieron afrontar o concluir exitosamente en esta etapa. Muchas de ellas impidieron avanzar en un proceso m\u00e1s profundo de transformaci\u00f3n productiva, relacionada con una escasa vinculaci\u00f3n entre el sistema cient\u00edfico-tecnol\u00f3gico y el aparato productivo del pa\u00eds y a la pobre integraci\u00f3n entre los distintos institutos de investigaci\u00f3n, universidades y empresas p\u00fablicas dedicadas al desarrollo e innovaci\u00f3n. A partir de diciembre de 2015 y hasta 2019, se puso en pr\u00e1ctica una concepci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica general que tuvo como obje - tivo el repliegue del papel del Estado como conductor del proceso de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico y promotor de la equidad social que implic\u00f3 el achicamiento del estado en todas sus funciones, y, por supuesto, eso incidi\u00f3 negativamente en el sector cient\u00edfico - acad\u00e9mico argentino. La disminuci\u00f3n de recursos aplicada al sector signific\u00f3 no solo que centenares de investigadores formados durante a\u00f1os quedaran fuera del sistema, sino tambi\u00e9n el fin de las pol\u00edticas de crecimiento de la carrera cient\u00edfica.Estas apreciaciones volcadas en este discurso no son nuevas. Repasando los discursos de presidentes y presidentas anteriores, estos comentarios han sido volcados en muchos de ellos. Aun as\u00ed, y m \u00e1s all\u00e1 de los distintos aconteceres de la realidad nacional y de la falta de una interrelaci\u00f3n eficiente entre los distintos sectores de I+D, la SAIC sigui\u00f3 funcionando y convirti\u00e9ndose para muchos becarios e investigadores j\u00f3venes que se quedaron en el pa\u00eds, en el escenario esperado adonde concurrir y debatir sus resultados, sus hip\u00f3tesis y sus teor\u00edas, de manera tal que el conocimiento en el \u00e1rea biom\u00e9dica pudo crecer sostenidamente, construido sobre la integraci\u00f3n interdisciplinaria. Y esto puede apreciarse en las instituciones que comparten las autor\u00edas de muchos de los trabajos presentados: Institutos de investigaci\u00f3n, hospitales, bio-empresas. Las ciencias experimentales lograron crear la urdimbre necesaria de manera emp\u00edrica, y en base a las necesidades reales de cada instituci\u00f3n. Muchos de nosotros comenzamos el a\u00f1o 2020 con muchas esperanzas. Se vislumbraba un cambio de direcci\u00f3n en las pol\u00edticas de CyT. La reposici\u00f3n del Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n Productiva era un s\u00edmbolo que indicaba el comienzo de un largo per\u00edodo de reconstrucci\u00f3n. En lo personal, como Presidenta de SAIC, mi intenci\u00f3n era realizar, tal vez siendo muy ambiciosa, una reuni\u00f3n Cient\u00ed - fica inmensamente rica y constructiva. Pero en marzo todo nuestro universo cambi\u00f3. La pandemia fue (y lo sigue siendo) la gran protagonista de este a\u00f1o y ha superado en popularidad a otras amenazas mundiales que parec\u00edan ser igual de peligrosas. En los primeros ocho meses de 2020 el coronavirus contagi\u00f3 a m\u00e1s de 24 millones de personas, produjo cerca de 1 mill\u00f3n de muertes alrededor del mundo y hasta hoy no da tregua, con rebrotes en zonas donde ya hab\u00eda bajado su circulaci\u00f3n. Sabemos que si hay algo que le puede devolver la normali - dad a nuestras vidas es el hallazgo de un medio de prevenci\u00f3n, y es en esa direcci\u00f3n en la que cient\u00edficas y cient\u00edficos de todo el mundo, incluido nuestro pa\u00eds, trabajan para llegar en tiempo record. En este contexto, la SAIC no se detuvo. Junto con la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva, decidimos seguir trabajando, tratando de adaptarnos a la dura realidad, inesperada y dram\u00e1tica. En junio realizamos el Simposio de COVID19, nuestra primera experiencia virtual, y en la que pudimos poner de manifiesto las \u00faltimas novedades que nuestros cient\u00edficos estaban produciendo en el combate contra el virus. El \u00e9xito alcanzado nos dio la fuerza para continuar y organizar la Reuni\u00f3n Anual con la misma metodolog\u00eda. A principios de septiembre nos vimos impulsados a publicar un Llamado a la Responsabilidad Ciudadana, debido a la intensidad que hab\u00eda adquirido la pandemia en todo el pa\u00eds. La situaci\u00f3n era de una relevancia dram\u00e1tica, y as\u00ed lo expresamos. La nota repercuti\u00f3 y fue repicada en redes y en muchos medios audiovisuales y gr\u00e1ficos de todo el pa\u00eds. La notoriedad que adquiri\u00f3 esta carta a la ciudadan\u00eda, publicada en nuestra p\u00e1gina web, puso de relieve la importan - cia y el nivel que tiene SAIC dentro de la comunidad nacional. La pandemia ha cambiado, a mi criterio, la concepci\u00f3n que ten\u00eda la ciudadan\u00eda sobre el sistema cient\u00edfico nacional, sobre todo luego que se pusiera en duda, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, la capacidad del mismo. La pregunta que recorri\u00f3 muchos portales durante el \u00faltimo gobierno liberal era: \u00bfPara qu\u00e9 sirve la ciencia? La reacci\u00f3n del sistema cient\u00edfico ante la pandemia ha dado la respuesta. Posiblemente haya un cambio esperanzador en el paradigma de lo que sig - nifica el desarrollo cient\u00edfico en la sociedad. Y se termine asociando el concepto de Soberan\u00eda con el de Desarrollo de Ciencia Nacional. Agradezco inmensamente a la extraordinaria Comisi\u00f3n Directiva con la que me toc\u00f3 trabajar. El entusiasmo, las ideas, la solidaridad de todos y todas permitieron un trabajo intenso y profundamente agradable. Agradezco especialmente al Dr. Alejandro Curino, vicepresidente de la SAIC, por su presencia y su soporte y por coincidir en que la forma de pensar la sociedad y el trabajo se pueden planificar por m\u00e1s de un per\u00edodo; al Dr. Enrique Sanchez Pozzi, nuestro tesorero y a la Dra. Mar\u00eda Laura Ruiz, nuestra secretaria, por el enorme e invaluable trabajo que han realizado. Les doy tambi\u00e9n mi agradecimiento al grupo G2, que trabaj\u00f3 codo a codo con todos nosotros, organizando esta tarea absolutamente nueva. Agradezco a los y las participantes, simposistas, coordinadores, evaluadores, a todas y todos los que presentaron trabajos, y en general, a los y las que confiaron en nosotros y se arriesgaron a esta aventura virtual. Agradezco, adem\u00e1s, a las otras sociedades que nos acompa\u00f1aron en esta experiencia. Entre todos hemos hecho posible este evento. Dra. Mar\u00eda Cristina Carrillo Presidenta de SAICDiscurso de la Dra. Anal\u00eda Trevani, Presidenta SAI Estimadas y estimados colegas, amigas y amigos En nombre de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de inmunolog\u00eda les doy una cordial bienvenida a una nueva reuni\u00f3n de Sociedades de Biociencias organizada de manera conjunta por la Sociedad Argentina de Investi - gaci\u00f3n Cl \u00ednica, la Sociedad Argentina de Fisiolog\u00eda y las Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda. Como es de p\u00fablico conocimiento, este a\u00f1o ha sido particularmente especial en todos los aspectos que incumben a nuestras vidas, y nuestra actividad profesional no ha resultado ajena, como tampoco lo vinculado a la organizaci\u00f3n de esta actividad cient\u00edfica. Luego de muchos meses de trabajo organizando el tercer congreso Franco-Argentino de Inmunolog\u00eda, con 25 disertantes extranjeros que hab\u00edan comprometido su participaci\u00f3n abon\u00e1ndose sus propios pasajes a\u00e9reos, un simposio conjunto con la \"Society of Leukocyte Biology\" de Estados Unidos proyectado y sponsors internacionales que hab\u00edan decidido acompa\u00f1arnos, debimos reprogramar la actividad, la cual, si la pandemia lo per - mite tendr\u00e1 lugar en 2021. A pesar de la decepci\u00f3n que esta situaci\u00f3n represent\u00f3 para esta comisi\u00f3n directiva, supimos aprovechar alguna de las ventajas que ofrece la virtualidad y logramos confeccionar para esta reuni\u00f3n, un programa que involucra la participaci\u00f3n de cient\u00edficos destacados internacionalmente, que abordar\u00e1n tem\u00e1ticas diversas de gran inter\u00e9s para los miembros de nuestras sociedades. A todos ellos les agradecemos su gentileza y generosidad por participar de este evento. Frente a la incertidumbre que representaba la realizaci\u00f3n de una reuni\u00f3n cient\u00edfica virtual, en un a\u00f1o en qu\u00e9 la mayor parte de las l\u00edneas de investigaci\u00f3n debi\u00f3 ser suspendida, nos sorprendimos gratamente una vez m\u00e1s con la respuesta de los inmun\u00f3logos, quienes presentaron 124 trabajos de investigaci\u00f3n 4 de los cuales ser\u00e1n defendidos para optar al premio Satz. Ello representa sin duda una muestra m\u00e1s de la fortaleza de nuestro sistema cient\u00edfico al cual nos sentimos orgullosos de pertenecer. Quiero aprovechar esta oportunidad para agradecer al CONICET que nos ha dado su apoyo mediante la l\u00ednea de financiamiento para reuniones cient\u00edficas y a las empresas privadas que nos han acompa\u00f1ado una vez m\u00e1s. Quiero agradecer tambi\u00e9n a toda la comisi\u00f3n directiva por su apoyo constante y su activa participaci\u00f3n en las acciones que mancomunadamente llevamos a cabo a lo largo de este a\u00f1o. Tambi\u00e9n al comit\u00e9 m\u00e9dico y al comit\u00e9 docente de nues - tra sociedad, en especial a Mar\u00eda Soledad Gori y Julieta Alca\u00edn por su trabajo en el manejo de las redes sociales de la SAI. Pero muy especialmente quiero agradecer a dos de los integrantes de nuestra comisi\u00f3n directiva; a la Dra. Carolina Jancic, la secretaria de nuestra sociedad, con qui\u00e9n diariamente compartimos todas las tareas que involucr\u00f3 esta gesti\u00f3n, y sin cuyo su enorme trabajo generoso, responsable y comprometido habr\u00eda sido imposible alcanzar los objetivos que nos propusimos; y al Dr. Mat\u00edas Ostrowski, por su activa labor a cargo de la tesorer\u00eda y por su ayuda en la organizaci\u00f3n de lo que iba a ser FAIC2020 y su compromiso con las actividades cient\u00edficas realizadas este a\u00f1o. A todos ellos quiero decirles gracias con may\u00fasculas. Tambi\u00e9n quiero agradecer a las y los integrantes de mi laboratorio por comprender mi menor interacci\u00f3n debido al tiempo que me demand\u00f3 llevar a cabo las actividades de la sociedad. Nuestro principal objetivo de gesti\u00f3n fue potenciar la participaci\u00f3n de los miembros de nuestra sociedad en las distintas actividades a realizar; fomentar la participaci\u00f3n y visibilizaci\u00f3n de los investigadores j\u00f3venes; incrementar la diversidad de miembros involucrados en la m\u00e1s amplia variedad de tareas y federalizar nuestra sociedad. Con este fin, para cada una de las actividades llevadas a cabo, convocamos a miembros de distintos lugares geogr\u00e1ficos y de diferentes es - calas de formaci\u00f3n tanto para actuar como disertantes como en su rol de coordinadores de actividades cient\u00edficas. En lo que respecta a la presente reuni\u00f3n, seleccionamos a disertantes nacionales que no hubiesen participado en a\u00f1os recientes en nuestras reuniones cient\u00edficas, con el objetivo de ampliar la difusi\u00f3n del trabajo de distintos miembros de nuestra sociedad. Aun cuando la pandemia signific\u00f3 un impedimento para la ejecuci\u00f3n de algunas actividades que ten\u00edamos proyectadas, logramos tomar ventaja de la situaci\u00f3n y perseguir y alcanzar otra de las metas que nos hab\u00eda - mos impuesto, como la de extender el alcance de nuestras actividades para que pudieran ser aprovechadas por todos aquellos interesados en la adquisici\u00f3n de conocimiento. Por ello, realizamos actividades de gran calidad acad\u00e9mica, abiertas y sin costo alguno, las cuales fueron aprovechadas no s \u00f3lo por colegas de nuestro pa\u00eds sino tambi\u00e9n de otros pa\u00edses latinoamericanos miembros de ALACI, gracias a la intensa campa\u00f1a de difusi\u00f3n que emprendimos. Ninguna de estas actividades habr\u00eda sido posible sin la generosidad y el compromiso de todos aquellos que invirtieron su ti - empo y esfuerzo para realizar las presentaciones que nos permitieron actualizarnos en las diversas tem\u00e1ticas que se abordaron. A todas y todos ellos, much\u00edsimas gracias! Tambi\u00e9n a los disertantes internacionales que generosamente, y a pesar de las diferencias horarias y en algunos casos, en medio de sus vacaciones, aceptaron ser parte de un proyec - to abierto de difusi\u00f3n del conocimiento cient\u00edfico. Nos deja un sabor amargo en esta gesti\u00f3n, el haber tomado conocimiento de que algunos miembros del \u00e1rea cl\u00ednica consideren necesaria la creaci\u00f3n de una asociaci\u00f3n que los nuclee por no sentir representados sus intereses en esta sociedad. Aun cuando entendemos que en muchos casos el curso natural de la diversificaci\u00f3n del conocimiento con - duce a la necesidad de generar espacios de discusi\u00f3n propios, para la mayor parte de los miembros de esta comisi\u00f3n directiva ser\u00eda m\u00e1s enriquecedor que los mismos se gestaran en el marco de la sociedad existente. Las sociedades cient\u00edficas deber\u00edan ser espacios din\u00e1micos en d\u00f3nde la discusi\u00f3n constructiva permitiese canalizar cambios org\u00e1nicos en acuerdo con el avance del conocimiento. Tenemos claro, sin embargo, que ninguno de esos cambios puede ser llevado a cabo sin el trabajo comprometido de todos los interesados. A la luz del desarrollo de esta nueva asociaci\u00f3n, esperamos que en el futuro ambas sociedades se comprometan a realizar actividades conjuntas peri\u00f3dicas, porque ello sin duda representar\u00eda un aporte mutuo. Quiero dedicar los \u00faltimos minutos de este espacio que se me ha brindado por mi papel dentro de la Sociedad Ar - gentina de Inmunolog\u00eda, para referirme al contexto en el cual transitamos esta gesti\u00f3n y su impacto. En este tiempo, hemos presenciado con enorme satisfacci\u00f3n la respuesta colectiva del sistema cient\u00edfico mundial para entender la fisiopatolog\u00eda de la COVID-19 y desarrollar estrategias terap\u00e9uticas para enfrentarla. Sin embargo, debido a la pan - demia, tambi\u00e9n hemos sido arrasados por una vor\u00e1gine de informaci\u00f3n con y sin sustento cient\u00edfico, divulgaci\u00f3n de resultados de investigaciones cient\u00edficas no evaluadas por pares y de informaci\u00f3n de estudios cl\u00ednicos carentes de un dise\u00f1o adecuado. Dado que ello puede conducir a la toma de decisiones cl\u00ednicas sin la evidencia suficiente y con consecuencias que pueden ser impredecibles para los pacientes y la sociedad, considero que como integrantes del sistema cient\u00edfico, esto merece que reflexionemos al respecto. Por otra parte, en este tiempo, tambi\u00e9n asistimos a la aparici\u00f3n en las redes y medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, de individuos que amparados en sus t\u00edtulos acad\u00e9micos, divulgan informaci\u00f3n pseudocient\u00edfica tergiversada a una sociedad que est\u00e1 ansiosa de certezas y esperanza, ocasionando un gran da\u00f1o a la sociedad ante esta situaci\u00f3n tan compleja que nos ha tocado vivir. Por ello, la SAI, as\u00ed como muchos de sus miembros de forma individual o colectiva, ha hecho un gran esfuerzo por divulgar informaci\u00f3n certera a trav\u00e9s de sus seminarios virtuales y su comunicaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de las redes sociales. La aparici\u00f3n de la COVID-19 tambi\u00e9n puso de relieve como nunca antes la capacidad de nuestros cient\u00edficos, los que a pesar de estar inmersos en un sistema que en la gesti\u00f3n gubernamental anterior sufri\u00f3 un enorme deterioro, con un Ministerio de ciencia degradado a la categor\u00eda de secretar\u00eda, con una inversi\u00f3n en insumos, equipamiento y salarios absolutamente devaluados, fue capaz de responder de manera colectiva para enfrentar esta pandemia. Fue gracias a la calidad acad\u00e9mica de sus integrantes que se pudo dar respuesta en tiempo r\u00e9cord al desarrollo de kits diagn\u00f3sti - cos, de protocolos de investigaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y cl\u00ednica, al de herramientas terap\u00e9uticas y vacunas, y al asesoramiento al sistema de salud. Esta capacidad de respuesta no se logra de manera repentina. Se sustenta en a\u00f1os de tiempo y esfuerzo para la formaci\u00f3n de recursos humanos altamente calificados e inversi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica; se sustenta en la capacidad de acceso a tecnolog\u00edas de vanguardia y en una planificaci\u00f3n estrat\u00e9gica pensando en un modelo de pa\u00eds soberano. La construcci\u00f3n de un sistema cient\u00edfico s\u00f3lido es un camino lento y sembrado de numerosos obst\u00e1culos, pero su destrucci\u00f3n puede ocurrir de forma acelerada, como lo han demostrado los a\u00f1os recientes, en que las pol\u00edticas aplicadas condujeron a la p\u00e9rdida de profesionales que costaron dinero y dedicaci\u00f3n en formar, e incrementaron la brecha tecnol\u00f3gica debida a una desinversi\u00f3n sostenida. En lo personal, celebro que la actual gesti\u00f3n gubernamental haya devuelto el rango ministerial a la ciencia, dado que esto no implica s\u00f3lo un cambio de nombre sino de pol\u00edticas y planificaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n celebro que sean nuestros colegas cient\u00edficos quienes est\u00e9n a cargo de dichas decisiones y su esfuerzo por retener los recursos humanos ya formados y por realizar una gesti\u00f3n previsible y transparente. Pero soy consciente de que esto no es suficiente; necesitamos incrementar la inversi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en ciencia dado que los insumos y equipos se encuentran dolarizados y nuestros subsidios pesificados. Entiendo las dificultades de lle - varlo a la pr\u00e1ctica en el contexto de una crisis econ\u00f3mica mundial producto de la pandemia. Pero como en todos los \u00f3rdenes de la vida, resulta necesario establecer prioridades, y la pandemia de COVID-19 ha puesto de manifiesto que el sostenimiento del sistema cient\u00edfico deber\u00eda ser una de ellas. Por ello, espero que los legisladores de las distintas fuerzas pol\u00edticas finalmente aprueben en el parlamento una Ley de Ciencia que garantice un incremento sostenido del porcentaje de la funci\u00f3n ciencia y t\u00e9cnica sobre el PBI, para llevarlo en los pr\u00f3ximos diez a\u00f1os al 1,5%. Para concluir, quiero expresar un profundo y sentido agradecimiento a todos los miembros de las sociedades cient\u00edficas participantes que han contribuido con su trabajo y esfuerzo al diagn\u00f3stico y atenci\u00f3n de los pacientes con COVID-19, a la investigaci\u00f3n sobre esta tem\u00e1tica y a la difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n a la poblaci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n quiero expresar el deseo de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la SAI de que esta primera reuni\u00f3n cient\u00edfica virtual sea fruct\u00edfera y que a pesar de la falta de presencialidad nos permita conectarnos y que sea el cimiento de cooperaciones futuras. Muchas gracias, un saludo afectuoso, Anal\u00eda Trevani Presidenta SAI Discurso de la Dra. Mar\u00eda Cecilia Larocca, Presidenta SAFIS Queridos colegas, compa\u00f1eros y amigos, Es un placer y un honor para m\u00ed darles la bienvenida a la Reuni\u00f3n anual conjunta 2020, en representaci\u00f3n de la Comisi\u00f3n directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de Fisiolog\u00eda (SAFIS). De m\u00e1s est\u00e1 describir el dif\u00edcil momento que estamos viviendo como sociedad, en el que el sentimiento de angustia se mezcla con la tristeza y la impotencia, pero tambi\u00e9n con la esperanza y la solidaridad. Analizando c\u00f3mo impacta este momento a la comunidad cient\u00edfica surge mi convicci\u00f3n de que el mismo nos ofrece una oportunidad de gran empoderamiento. No creo que sea necesario en este \u00e1mbito remarcar la importancia que ha tenido la investigaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica en la b\u00fasqueda de respuestas de fondo en este momento. Pero s\u00ed me parece importante observar c\u00f3mo cada uno de nosotros ha logrado cosas previamente inimaginables: continuar con nuestra tarea como investigadores respetando los protocolos de aislamiento a la vez que damos clases online, desarrollamos estrategias de evaluaci\u00f3n virtual, hacemos la escuela de nuestros ni\u00f1os, trapeamos y preparamos la masa madre. Y todo esto en medio de una situaci\u00f3n emocional muy dura. Por lo tanto, creo que este momento tambi\u00e9n nos puede hacer repensar la posibilidad de potenciarnos realmente como cient\u00edficos. La posibilidad de lograr un sistema cient\u00edfico con mayor representatividad, en el que todos nos sintamos protagonistas y demos lo mejor de nosotros. Un sistema donde exijamos ser escuchados, donde podamos defender nuestros proyectos, y tambi\u00e9n donde escuchemos a nuestros pares independientemente de su trayectoria. Un sistema que permita a los investigadores m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes irse en b\u00fasqueda de capacitaci\u00f3n extra y nuevas perspectivas, pero que tambi\u00e9n les genere expectativas para querer volver. Y, por supuesto, un sistema que no deje de trabajar por una ley que garantice un crecimiento sostenido de la inversi\u00f3n en ciencia. Es el sistema que nos garantizar\u00e1 ser m\u00e1s fuertes y estar mejor preparados para dar respuestas a las demandas de estos contextos. Respecto a las actividades espec\u00edficas del congreso, los invitamos a participar de los distintos espacios generados para compartir los resultados de nuestras investigaciones, incluyendo la plataforma de videoposters y sus respectivas salas de discusi\u00f3n y el simposio donde presentar\u00e1n sus resultados los investigadores j\u00f3venes preseleccionados para al Premio SAFIS. Tambi\u00e9n a participar de la Conferencia SAFIS (a cargo del Dr. Guillermo Lehmann, Weill Cornell Medicine, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) enfocada en la discusi\u00f3n de la gen\u00f3mica de c\u00e9lulas individuales aplicada a la biolog\u00eda ocular y al desarrollo de nuevas estrategias terap\u00e9uticas y del Simposio de Nutrici\u00f3n y Fitoterapia, en el que prestigiosas investigadoras de nuestro pa\u00eds y del exterior presentar\u00e1n y discutir\u00e1n sus estudios. Asimismo, la comisi\u00f3n de Educaci\u00f3n de SAFIS organiz\u00f3 un simposio donde analizar con especialistas c\u00f3mo educar en tiempos de aislamiento social. Los alentamos a generar nuevos v\u00ednculos, a consultar, a contestar y a escuchar. Aguardando que en la pr\u00f3xima oportunidad podamos encontrarnos presencialmente, y brindar por ello, los saludo afectuosamente. M.

SAIC HONOR LECTURE TO DR. ROBERTO COCCO EXPERIENCE WITH 1000 PROSPECTIVE CASES OF NON-INVASIVE PRENATAL TESTING FOR ANEUPLOIDY SCREENING AND THE REPORTING OF TRISOMIES, MONOSOMY X MICRODELETIONS. D Pereyra; F Fay; MP HERITAS, 210 Rosario, Argentina Introduction: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy screening has become first line of testing in many countries for pregnant women independent of the risk and age, mainly due to its high sensitivity and specificity for chromosomes 21, 18 and 13. However, many laboratories around the world report other chromosomes aneuplodies, monosomy X and even microdeletions / other international guidance. We developed the first non-invasive prenatal test in Argentina and hereby we report our experience with 1000 cases. Results: We used a cut-off of 3% fetal fractions. Prospective analysis of 1000 samples a total of aneuploidies distributed as following: trisomy 21 (49 cases), trisomy 18 (17 cases), trisomy 13 (4 cases), Monosomy X (8 cases) and other rare trisomies in chromosomes 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 22 (10 cases). All the detected cases presented ultrasound confirmed by invasive testing. There was a single false negative, which resulted in a triploidy, a known limitation of NIPT. There was a single positive related to monosomy X. Three abnormalities were confined as mosaics. The non-result rate due to low fetal fraction 2,53 %. To obtain better accuracy while reporting monosomy X, we yielded a correct result during the re- analysis of the false in this prospective cohort. We also developed an improved version of confirmation of the results by invasive testing. On the other hand, we did not observe accuracy problems in reporting rare trisomies since all of them were confirmed by invasive testing. SAIC HONOR LECTURE TO DR. SYSTEM CHANNELS.

Argentina has the sad privilege to have the highest in - cidence of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in the world. by the renal compromise, with an annual incidence of 6.23 per 100,000 children under 5 years of age. Most cases are associated with diarrheal prodromal and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) more than 70 % of the patients. HUS is the leading cause of acute renal failure, the sec - ond cause of chronic kidney disease and 3 % of the pa - tients die every year. Despite the huge experience in the diagnosis, treatment and control of this disease there are questions without a definitive answer: 1)Why do have the highest incidence in the world? The fact that Argentina is an agricultural and livestock country and cattle is the main reservoir for STEC, chil - dren start eating meat at an early age, the high meat consumption per person could explain in part the high incidence of HUS but the most important issue is the high prevalence of a hypervirulent strain. 2) Which patients with STEC-infection have more risk to develop HUS? The earlier the detection of STEC, risk. 3) Which patients with STEC-HUS have more risk to de counts, C3 levels and hyponatremia could help to improve the treatment. 4) Which patients with STEC-HUS have more risk to have a poor long-term renal prognosis?

As part of the mechanisms, the aforementioned results can be attributed to differences in the regulators of the level of fatty We found SREBP1c and the acids in IR rats, and were significantly related to the production of large VLDL particles, with a high content of TG.

CRISPR technology has generated great expectation in the field of gene editing. Since March 2020, Stanford's laboratory has become a world referent by offering an antiviral therapy. Up to date COVID-19 continues spreading relentless worldwide, mainly over winter time of the southern hemisphere. During this time, the virus has undergone mutations with uncertain impact on the efficacy of the crRNAs originally designed by Abbott. Our aim is to analyze the performance of Stanford's crRNAs the main contribution of GR (53%), G (24%), (15%) in GISAD. The alignment of crRNAs to SAGS resulted crRNA presenting an alignment efficiency lower 269 misalignments mainly on sequences from Brazil (74%), Peru (10%) and Chile (8%). Mis - aligned Brazilian sequences had a distinctive predicted a high efficacy score for 2 of the 4 crRNAs (Q4-Q3) and low for the remaining 2 (Q2-Q1). Conclusion .

Materials and Methods : Isolated to 30 min ischemia followed by 45 min reperfusion (R) in the presence or absence of 0.23 mM CoCl2 which was maintained or removed after 20 min of R. Aortic contractility was evaluated in an cubation with cumulative noradrenaline (NA) doses. After NA wash - ing, 20 min of simulated arterial ischemia (SI) and R with or without CoCl was performed, and NA response was re-evaluated. Results : During R, the presence of CoCl did not alter the cardiac resting pressure, nor the perfusion pressure, but increased the de - veloped pressure (p<0.05) until 20 min which then descend reach ing values. This decrease was prevented when CoCl was eliminated at 20 min of R. CoCl in R increased the contractile econ not at higher ones. CoCl in post -SI R did not affect (EC of the cardiac damage produced at least during the first 25 min of R and reduces the arterial adrenergic contractile response. These re - sults support the use CoCl as a potential cardioprotective tool of clinical relevance.

Muscular Dystrophies (MD) are a group of rare inherited diseases that cause weakness and progressive degeneration of hindering differential of paramount importance to estab - lish the standard of care. Among them, Dystrophinopathies are the most prevalent type of MD and are caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Genetic or molecular studies are the gold standard for reach - ing a MD differential diagnosis, for which molecular alterations in MD associated genes can be detected by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). One of the major challenges of the Next Generation Se - quencing (NGS) data interpretation is the occurrence of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS).

In our country, 16% of PCT patients are the same family as ABCG2, in the onset of PCT in HIV carriers was reported. The aim was to evaluate the role of the NM_004827.3:c.421C>A (rs2231142) variant of ABCG2 gene in the association PCT-HIV. A population of control, HIV, PCT and PCT-HIV individuals studied. was done by PCR- RFLP. The non-wild type allele A was in a very low frequency in all the groups. In PCT-HIV, the frequency of A (0.21) was ge - notypic in a very low frequency in heterozy - gosis in all the groups with higher values for PCT-HIV group (36%, p<0.01) than PCT (10%) and HIV (9%). The AA genotype (3%) was only found in PCT-HIV group. These results, although preliminary, suggest that NM_004827.3:c.421C>A variant the ABCG2 could be related to the manifestation of this porphyria only in HIV patients. The analysis of the other SNVs (NM_004827.3:c.34G>A, NM_004827.3:c.376C>T) will allow us to establish the presence or absence of risk haplotypes in the manifestation of PCT associated or not with HIV infection. The results of this analysis, together with those drug conclude about the risk haplotype for PCT triggering. 105.

Red blood cell (RBC) storage injury is the deterioration caused during its conservation in the blood bank. One of its causes is the autoxidation of for method. The objective was to the blood bank (DRG). The EOHb were evaluated with a spectral sweep between 500 and 700 nm at different concentrations and pH. The most influential factor was the Hb concentration of the sample, adjusted to 0.7 mg/mL, intracellular content of H2O2 as a fluorescence peak at 485 nm under excitation at 321 nm. The emission spectrum between 400 and 600 nm was analyzed at different concentrations and storage conditions. A peak was not observed at 485 nm, but the emission average between 470 and 490 nm was correlated with it and was more precise (CV 5.5% vs 11.4%, p <0.003). The Hb con - centration was adjusted to 50 uM to standardize the quenching. The results were stable for 18 days in samples stored at -80 \u00b0C. The esti - GRDs, their supernatants plasmas with and without Fe (II), and H2O2 calibrators between 0.1 uM and 100 mM were assayed. The DRGs did not produce a reaction, the quantification range in acellular me - dia was 15 to 100 mM and Fe(II) only acted as a catalyst. The best working conditions for EOHb are to adjust the Hb concentration to 0.7 mg/mL at pH 7.5, for FHP the Hb concentration must be adjust - ed to 50 uM, and use acellular solutions to estimate XOOH without Fe(II) for end-point reactions.

Finally, since a fu - ture vaccine supply is unlikely to suffice for massive vaccination, SEIR-HL and the Ro formula were used to estimate the impact of the selective vaccination of age groups, the 20-39 year population being the best target for the reduction of Ro (and therefore of the spread of the infection) and the population over 70 being the best target for the reduction of hospitalization and mortality. The model also predicts that the younger population with high contact rate is more likely to have a high fraction of recovered individuals as the ep that this a great extent redundant.

The frequency of tempo - ral appearance and the state of adaptation to the environment of COVID-19 can be determined through the Fractal indicate a decrease of the COVID-19 system response to the environment demands. It was proposed to investigate the predictive behaviour of COVID-19 according to its frequency of temporal appearance by the Higuchi algorithm (AH) in Argentine Republic (RA), Santa Fe Province (PSF) and Rosario City (CR). Observational, longitudinal and prospective study. Positive cases (CP) of COVID-19 were considered by testing (PCR swab - bing) according to daily reports from the Ministry of Health of RA and PSF, from the epidemiological week (SE) in which the first CP appeared in each territory until the SE-36. AH was applied by SE. DF and R\u00b2 were expressed as median (M) and Standard deviation (\u00b1).

FLENI-CONICET 2. University of Florida, USA The quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy images has a fundamental role in biology and medicine. One of the biggest challenges in the field is to detect cells stained for different markers automatically. The recent deep learning algorithms such as Cellpose is revolutionizing the field and bringing us closer to the wide adoption of image cytometry techniques. However, this algorithm returns its results in labelled image format, and its use is therefore limited to people with programming skills. The objective of this work was to develop a plugin for the FIJI / ImageJ software that would allow the use of segmentations generated in Cellpose by scientists with basic knowledge in image analysis. Our plugin ex - tracts the objects from the labelled images and returns them in the form of regions of interest or ROIs. We each (CSA) measurements of the were strongly biased by the type of staining used, being up to 30% higher than those manual segmentation. The incorporation of a segmentation erosion tool into our to correct this bias, making them practically indistinguishable those gener - ated manually by experts. We tested the use of Cellpose together with our plugin in muscle damage and regeneration tests, where there is an overall change of the average CSA. Taking into account that manual segmentation of each image can take days, the use of Cellpose and our plugin allows a very significant saving of time and wide adoption by users without programming knowledge. 151.

Long non-coding RNA genes (lncRNA) were identified more than a decade ago, and since, they have been shown to fulfill a diverse expres - sion through cis-regulatory regions (super-enhancers, SE). To this end, we first differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) into cardiomyocytes populations (FDR<0.05), of which 729 co-occurred with an active SE (in respect to cell identity) within the boundaries of a Topologically Associat - Domain (TAD). The co-occurrences were statistically significant when compared to a random distribution indicating a possible functional association between the two features. we implemented a protocol to modulate the DE-lncRNAs (4 expressed in hiPSC and 4 in CM) for the evaluation of their functional implica - tion in gene regulation. To do so, used a guides flanking region which includes to genomic DNA from transfected pools of cells.

NAC is also an antidote for acetaminophen (AP) hepatotoxicity in vivo , the aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities after 24 h NAC treatment. Our aim is to evaluate horticulture extracts Hep-G2 cells treated with 15 mM AP and HE for 24h. After these treatments, we evaluated cytotoxicity by MTT and In levels. Results: highest HE AO/mg were 88 + 5% (orange, OE), 74 + 1% (carqueja, CE), 70 + 2% (quebracho, QE) and 68 + 4% (cassis, CsE). CsE was toxic to Hep-G2 cells, but CsE treatment on AD resulted in a significant decrease in Chol (by 31%) and Tg (by 62%) levels, without toxic effects. AP treatment was toxic to Hep-G2 cells and increased by 3 folds AST and ALT activities compared treated cells (p<0.01); ALT decrease: 30 + 5, 34 + 1 and 62 + 3, respectively; AST decrease: 26 + 2, 19 + 1 and 35 + 1, respectively. The rest of HE with low AO, such as boldo (34 + 2%), could not decrease ALT or AST activities. Conclusion: Only non-toxic HE effect. Just QE could decrease ALT and AST activities to similar values of those of NAC. 161. (68) INTERFERON ALPHA 2B (IFN--2B) BUT NOT VI - MC1;2 1.

The high economic value that crocodilian leather and meat has today is recognized. However, there are other derivatives such as fats from these animals, which are discarded and could be used as sources of natural oils with potential applications in food. In recent years, the demand for natural oils by the industry has increased, seeking natural alternatives, especially when we mention fatty acids (FA) of -3 and -6 families whose relationship can have differ - ent effects on health. The objective was to obtain caiman oil from fatty deposits of latirostris for potential use as a dietary supplement. Oil was extracted from fat by melting at 60 \u00b0C. The FA profile was analyzed by gas chromatography. Oxidative stability was peroxide index (PI), anisidine index (AI) and Kreiss index (KI). A microbiological study was carried out on the oil, which showed absence of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total Likewise, the presence of 2% acid evidenced. The PI values were kept below 6 meq O2 / Kg oil, while KI was negative and AI was not detectable. Since the consumption of a product derived from caiman fat is not part of the usual diet of the population, it was essential to choose a analytical formance, high oxidative hydrolytic stability, without microbial load and cost. Nutritionally, obtained caiman oil results an excellent source of essential FA, being a healthy and sustainable alternative that could be incorporated as part of the human diet. ids 180.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli is responsible for Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a cause of renal failure in children. We have previously shown that C-9 and Eliglustat cytotoxic effects of Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2), in human cortical renal tubular epithelial cells (HRTEC) primary cultures and HK2 cell line. The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of EG, Cells were incubated with Stx2 (1 ng/ml, 24 and 72 h) and pre-incubated with or without EG (1-500 nM, 6 and 24 h), followed by co-incubation with same dilutions of EG and Stx2 (24 and 72 h). Total number of cells stained with Hoechst was counted in microphotographs and compared with cell viability mea - sured by neutral red uptake. Early and late apoptosis preincubated with EG (50 nM, 24 h or 500 nM, 6 h) totally prevented Stx2 effects on of HK2 cells with EG (1 nM, 24 h or 10 nM, 6 h) totally prevented Stx2 effects on cell se . In conclusion, EG renal being HRTEC more sensitive than HK2. Treatment with could be novel sub strate inhibition therapy to neutralize Stx2 action and prevent in patients with HUS.

We had previously shown that Endothelin (ET) inhibition with (20 a dual ET receptor antagonist (ERA), leads to alterations in both ET-1 and apopto - in the kidney and this could be a consequence of an imbalance between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-). It is known that delicate balance between and O2- , besides contributing to devel - opment, is important for renal sodium handling. The aim of this work was to evaluate in 7 day old rats (male and Westernblot and renal pre-pro ET-1 by real time PCR. Four experimental groups were studied: control males (Cm), males treated with bosentan (ERAm), control females (Cf) bosentan (ERAf). Two-way ANOVA was used for of sex for pre-pro ET-1 expression (p<0.05), be - ing higher f and for ETB expression being higher in f than in m. However ETA/ETB ratio was not significantly different between groups. On the other hand, we found a decrease in NADPHd activity in im - mature cortical renal structures only in ERAm (p<0. 05) and in mac - ula densa in both ERAm and ERAf vs their controls (p<0. 05) and a the to decrease expression renal pre-pro ET-1 and ETB receptor has sex differences in early life but it is not affected by ET inhibition at this stage. 185.

The aim of the present work is to study the effects of 17E on cell proliferation and the expression of NKA in a human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) and treated with (10 nM, 24 h) with or without an agonist (G-1) or an antagonist (G- 15) of control cells (p<0.05). The treatment of HK-2 with G-15 (100 nM) inhibited 17E effect on cell proliferation. The treatment the BrdU uptake as observed in HRTEC (p<0.05). The treatment of HK-2 with 17E and with G-1 (10 nM, 24 hs) decreased NKA expression compared with control in - crease of D1DR (dopamine receptor) expression was associated with the decrease of These results match with previous produced an increase of NKA expression in renal medulla while there was a de - crease of D1DR, both in cortex and medulla. Likewise, hormonal replacement on oVx animals with 17E diminished the expression of NKA in renal medulla.

We studied at 60 days of life. At 138 days of life, half of them were supplemented with 5 mg testosterone pro - pionate (s.c. pellets) and the other half ORX with choles - terol (ORX-cho) as vehicle. During the last 5 days of the study, half of rats in each group received normal Glomeru filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), sodium and water excretion and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. To an - alyze the response of renal function HS, subunit Na+,K+-ATPase mRNA (Atpa1a) expression by RT-PCR and the and total Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) as an activity index (dNKA/tNKA) were determined in renal cortex and medulla by Western blot. Results. MAP under NS was similar between ORX-cho and ORX- To and did not change upon HS intake. ORX-To rats showed an increased dNKA/tNKA ratio in renal medulla under NS and HS diet and a lower cortical Atpa1a than ORX-cho with HS. Sodium and water excretion in were lower than in ORX-cho HS (both p<0.05). GFR and RPF increased with HS in ORX-To and ORX-cho (both p<0.05), but the increment cho (p<0.05). Conclusion. The retention of sodium and water in To could be the consequence of a more active NKA. Despite sodium and water re - tention, MAP remains unchanged probably by a decrease in renal vascular resistance. Under HS intake the volume of the extracellular fluid and MAP are regulated through renal hemodynamic mecha - nisms. These findings provide better understanding the effect male on 190.

In order to investigate if these modified behaviours were due to Te prolonged exposition, in the present work a short treatment (21 days) of Te ad - ministration to mother rats in the lactation period was applied. At 30 day-old, all offspring were tested in the Double Lateral Hole Board Labyrinth (DLHB), and 24 hours later in the Intruder to Resident Test (IRT), as previously described.

Colorectal carcinogenesis (CRc) is a process that stems from genet - ic mutations induced by physical or chemical agents. Epidemiolog - ical studies that of diet could directly affect the development of the disease. His - torically, there have been mixed positions in what concerns yerba mate's pro or anti carcinogenic role. In 1991, the IARC classified hot mate as a probable carcinogenic beverage. In 2016, IARC again evaluated the carcinogenicity of mate under the hypothesis \"It is the temperature of the water and not the plant that is associated with cancer\". Due to insufficient evidence, cold mate could not be classified. There are no studies that evaluate the relation between consumption of cold mate and the carcinogenesis process. The aim of our research was to evaluate whether the consumption of cold mate modulated CRc. the model, we used 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Cold beverages of yerba mate extract (YMe) in a dose of 1.6 gr/kg/ day and Maltodextrin (MD - excipient of extract), with DMH (20 mg/kg/week) subcutaneously once a week for 14 weeks. Fourteen weeks after the last DMH injection, the animals In female mice we observed that control group (MD + DMH) developed tubulovillous adenomas while, in the treated group animals presented normal mucosa. In male mice, 37.5% of the MD + DMH group and 42% of the YM + DMH group showed adenomas. It is the first study that reports, on the one hand, that cold mate is not a carcinogenic beverage and on the other hand that chronic consumption of YMe would have Centro de Oncolog\u00eda Molecular y Traslacional, Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2 Centro de Medicina Comparada, Instituto de Ciencias Ve - terinarias del Litoral, Universidad Nacional del Litoral / CO - NICET Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the so-called westernized diseas - es and is the third most common cancer in both men and women. In a previous work, we reported that yerba mate extract (YMe) from Ilex paraguariensis, a native South American tree of compounds, inhibits CT26 cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis. The aim of this research was to determine the mechanism by which apoptosis is induced by YMe. To this end, in vitro and in vivo experimentation was carried out using CRC mod - els. The mechanism of cellular apoptosis has an sic or intrinsic pathway. It is reported that a key point pathway anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 murine syngeneic tumor model, we showed that oral ad - ministration of YMe significantly inhibited tumor growth. The tumor growth rate is the result of the balance between the proliferation and the induction to apoptosis of the neoplastic cells. Therefore, to deter - mine whether this reduction in tumor growth was due to an increase in cell apoptosis, a TUNEL assay on the tumor section was per - formed. In agreement with in tumor tissues.

EHEC for developing typical Hemolytic Uremic (HUS) and Argentina the highest incidence in the world. The endemo-epidemic behavior that HUS presents in our country was associated with person-to-person transmission. Since children below 5 years old are the most affected, our objective was to deter - mine an informative talk given by LuSUH, a non-governmental association, about good practices to reduce HUS transmission. Then, 63 of them voluntarily gave, under a signed written obtained commercial ELISA (Chemtest, Arg) was used to detect specific IgM and serotypes with in Argentina. The IgM finding was considered as indirect evidence samples were pos - itive for at least one type of LPS. Fifty-six percent of them IgM positive. Fifty percent of the positive samples were re - active for LPS O157, 26% for LPS O121, 12% for LPS O145 and 2% for LPS O103. Among the samples positive for LPS O157, 5% belonged to IgM isotype, 31% to IgG and 14% had both. The IgG isotype was the unique detected for LPS O145 and O103 (12 and 2%, respectively). For LPS O121, the IgM isotype was detected in 2%, IgG in 12% and both isotypes in 12% of the samples. The elevated frequency of reactive circulation of EHEC strains in our agrees carry suggesting that they would be in the active phase of infection.399.

The of - stimulatory molecules SLAM and ICOS was evaluated at 5 and 8 days post-infection (pi) in lamina propria cells increased - pared to control mice. SLAM levels were upregulated only at day 8 pi. A further characterization showed that more than 90% of the CD4- cells are CD8+ cells in MLNs, this was not the case in LPMCs, where less than half of the CD4- were in LPMCs both SLAM and ICOS were downregulated at day 8 pi. IFN- g produced by CD4+ and CD4- cells was only downregulated at day 5 pi in LPMCs. On the contrary, IL-17 production on CD4+ and was increased in infected mice compared to control on day 5 pi, with the highest levels on CD4- cells from LPMCs. At day 8, we observed a decrease of IL-17 production in Our that C. difficile modulates T course production and the increase of IL-10 could be associated with disease resolution. 424.

Cancer important role in breast cancer (BC) evolution and could be an interesting target in the de - velopment of future therapies. Many of them are -SMA + ,FSP + , FAP + , CD34 - and CD31 - spindle cells. CAF can originate from bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells and can be recog - nized by the expression of CD105 and 50% of CAF express CD105 in Previously, we found that the - tients (BCP) express CD105 non-malignant breast tissues. Considering that median overall survival (OS) from BC di - agnosis of 8.7 years, it is imperative to find a biomarker that can predict this event. propose that high CD105 expression could be a prognostic factor of the occurrence of BM in BCP, particularly the luminal subtype is known develop this type In study, we investigate the clinicopathological significance of CD105 in CAF, as of early We performed immunohistochemical expression associated with a higher risk of particular is the first demonstration that high CD105 expres - sion in CAF could be used as prognostic marker of BM occurrence and lower DFS, MFS, and early luminal BCP.

UBA)Emerging evidence shows that placental aquaporin-9 (AQP9) is not involved in the transfer of water between the mother and the fetus. However, its role in human placenta lactate. In transport lactate as an alternative energy substrate. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the participation of in the lactate transfer across the human METHODS: This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital Nacional Dr. Prof. A. Posadas. Explants from normal term placentas were cultured in low glucose with or without L-lactate, and in presence and absence of AQP9 inhibitors (0.3 mM HgCl2, not change compared to controls, suggesting that cell death is not due to necrosis. Moreover, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and apoptotic nuclei increased (n=5, L-lactate could be replacing glucose as an energy substrate. In this case, the blocking of AQP9 resulted in an increase in cell death p proposing that this has a role CONCLUSION: Our results show that placental AQP9 may have a key role in lactate transport as an alternative energy substrate.

The neurotoxicity caused by glyphosate variable such on activity by pesticides can with relatively simple techniques and may be used as a component of the FOB (Functional Observational Battery). The aim of this experiment was to determine the neuro-motor and tion in saline phosphate buffer (PBS). One dose of 70 mg/kg was tested every 48 hours for 14 days (n=12). A group of rats was used as control (n=12) that was injected with the vehicle. Body mass was recorded daily. Two tests were carried out in control and treated animals to determine the locomotor activity: open field and elevated plus maze, according to established proto - cols. The test recording was done through video camera, and then the data and statistical analysis were carried out by t student meth - od. We found that Glyph exposed rats showed decrease and distance traveled (p<0.05; p=0.0167) by Regarding elevate plus maze test, rats exhibited a decrease in motor activity time (p<0.05; p=0.0246). other hand, Glyph showed significant decrease on "}
