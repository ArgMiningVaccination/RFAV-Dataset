Palabras clavedenominaci\u00f3n de origen tomate Angol Introduction The literature shows that signaling of national or regional origin has effects on consumers' hedonic liking and that are favored over products from elsewhere. Like country of origin, region is also used as a quality cue and food safety signal (7, 37, 39, 40). However, the region of origin (RO) has some specific aspects. van der Lans et al . (2001) indicate that using RO for product differ - entiation can be compared to the effect (40), suggesting that a specific region creates positive emotions towards food from that area, enhancing the effect of origin (14). It seems that RO is a good strategy for adding value food products (9). Several studies that consumers value the regional origin of foods positively (4, 5, 7, 8, 19, 23, 26, 38), although they value more the protected designa - tions of origin (DO) than the protected geographical indications (GI). It should be pointed out that most of these works have considered processed foods and meat, and there are few studies with fresh products such as fruits and vegetables, even though greater effects can be expected from region of origin labeling for less processed foods However, two conditions are necessary for marketing based on RO (40). First, a significant proportion of the target market should be aware of the region. Second, consumers' regional associations should be favorable and relevant (9, 40). In keeping with this, 175Acceptance of a vegetable with designation of origin in two cities in southern Chile Tomo 47 N\u00b0 1 2015 Grunert (2005) found that origin has no effect on product quality evaluation when consumers lack knowledge about the region of origin. Similar findings were obtained by Teuber (2011) in Germany and by du Plessis and du Rand (2012) in South Africa. In this sense, Teuber (2011) concluded that the positive impacts of a region certification scheme must be communicated to consumers in order to be successful. Differences have also been found between countries - some give high importance to the regional origin of foods and others do not (9, 28) - as well as between different areas in the same country (28). Additionally, the acceptance of products with DO and GI may be related to some consumer characteristics, such as gender (9, 26), age (9, 20), education level and income (20). Although most protected DO and GI are registered in developed countries (26), in Latin America studies are underway to register DO and GI in order to add value to different foods (5, 12, 22, 24). Indeed, GIs and DO may represent an opportunity for developing countries to move into lucrative niche markets (22). For example, in Brazil Brand\u00e3o et al. (2012) found that consumer perception of GI in meat is generally positive, and this attribute is recognized as a quality indicator. Consumers believe that this meat offers security and is more reliable than the product that does not mention the source. In addition, consumers value this attribute and are willing to pay more for meat with the seal of GI. In Chile, GI and DO are recognized and protected by Law 19.039 on Industrial Property. It defines GI as that which identifies a product as originating from a country, region or location in national territory, when the quality, reputation or other is ascribable, essentially, origin.A DO identifies a product as originating from the country, or a region or location in the national territory, when the quality, reputation or other characteristic is ascribable essentially to its geographic origin, considering, in addition, other natural and human factors that affect the characterization of the product. The Seal of Origin program began in 2011 as an initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism and the National Institute of Industrial Property (INAPI) to promote the use and the protection of Chilean products by registering GI and DO so as to drive entre-preneurship and productive development in Chilean communities (12). The procedure to request a GI or DO in Chile establishes that \"any person, natural or legal, can request the registration of a GI or a DO by presenting an application to INAPI, as long as it represents significant or establishments of extraction, production, processing or development is within the area established for the GI or DO requested. Further, the national, regional, provincial or communal authorities may request this registration when a GI or DO for a product is within the territory of its competence\" (12). However, the Seal of Origin program and the official seal were launched officially by the Government of Chile only in July 2012 (27); therefore, there are still few certification. Among the primary agricultural products, currently the only one that is certificate is the Pica lemon (GI). Llute\u00f1o maize, oregano from Putre, olive from Azapa, watermelon from Paine, lamb from Chilo\u00e9 and cherries from Chile Chico are all in the process of certification (27). Although the Government of Chile has made considerable progress in promoting 176B. Schnettler et al. Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias the official seal of origin (websites, television news, electronic and written its recent implementation and the scant supply of products with this seal in the market explain that it is still relatively unknown by consumers and that its accep-tance or non-acceptance by the consumer has yet to be assessed. In this context, tomatoes of various varieties have been for the municipality of Angol (Araucan\u00eda Regions) to supply markets in southern Chile in the summer. In the popular culture of the south, consumers are convinced that tomatoes produced in Angol are of quality (particularly in organoleptic aspects) than the tomatoes produced in other regions of the country. This is demonstrated in the use of the name \" Angolino tomato\" on the shelves where tomatoes are sold. On this basis, FONDEF (Fund have dealt with the importance of country of origin in consumer preferences in Chile (30, 32, 36, 41), there are much fewer studies that have focused on the preferences for foods produced in a particular region of Chile. In Temuco, Chile, Schnettler et al . (2009) determined that consumers prefer the traditional variety of tomato produced in Angol over the same variety produced in central Chile. Nevertheless, little remains known in Chile regarding consumer acceptance of foods with DO and GI. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the importance of information referring to DO in tomato relative to other attributes in the decision to to distinguish and consumer segments in relation their preferences RO are thought to be an important source for their affective feelings related to regional products (14, 40). In this regard, recent studies have concluded food well-being (17, 33). It has been reported that there is a relation between satisfaction with food-related life and preferences for foods with different attributes (34, 35). Therefore, it is expected that the preference for a certain DO will differ to designation of origin. H2. Consumer preferences will be associated with their demographic charac-teristics and their degree of satisfaction with food-related life. Materials and methods Survey Accidental non-probability sampling was used to recruit a sample of 400 consumers in Temuco and Puerto Montt, over 18 years of age respon - sible for the purchase of vegetables for their The number of respondents was obtained using the stratified random sampling allocation non-finite populations (N > 100,000; 177Acceptance of a vegetable with designation of origin in two cities in southern Chile Tomo 47 N\u00b0 1 2015 Temuco: 245,347 inhabitants according to the 2002 census), considering 95% confi - dence and 5% estimation error with p and q values of 0.5 (13). Thus, 200 people were surveyed in each city. The survey was applied personally by previously trained interviewers at the exit of two supermarkets in Temuco and Puerto Montt between August and October 2012. The interviewers approached people as they were leaving the supermarkets, explained to them the objectives of the survey and the strictly confidential treatment of the information obtained, and then asked if they were prepared to answer the questionnaire (mall intercept type). The response rate was 65%. Prior to the application of the survey, the question-naire was validated by a preliminary test with 10% of the survey sample. The preliminary test was done in the two supermarkets selected in Temuco, using the same method of addressing the participants as in the definitive survey. As the validation of the instrument was satisfactory, no changes used to determine whether the respondent had received information about DO, if they knew what it meant and the weekly consumption of tomatoes in the home. The questionnaire included the SWFL (Satisfaction with Food-related Life) scale. SWFL was proposed and in eight European countries (Cronbach's : 0.81-0.85); the five items on the scale are grouped into a single dimension: 1. Food and meals are positive elements, 2. I am generally pleased with my food, 3. My life in relation to food and meals is close to ideal, 4. With regard to food, the conditions of my life are excellent, 5. Food and meals give me satisfaction in daily life. The respondents were asked to indicate their degree survey method was used as that used by Grunert et al. The categories for each item on the SWFL were presented with a verbal description. In this study, the Spanish-language version of the SWFL was used, which levels of internal with Cronbach's coefficients between 0.82 and 0.88. In this levels of internal consistency (Cronbach's : of the explained variance. Based on sum scores of the scale, the distribution of the answers over four scale categories questions were included: gender , age, size of family group, area of residence, studies of the head of the household, and the possession of ten domestic goods. These two last variables help determine the socioeconomic group, which was classified as ABC1 (high and middle-high), C2 (middle-middle), C3 (lower-middle), D (low) and E (very low) (1). Statistical analysis A conjoint analysis (CA) was employed to determine the acceptance of tomatoes with DO. CA is a decompositional methodology that allows the relative importance of the attributes of a product 178B. Schnettler et al. Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias and the part worth utility values for each level of an attribute worth how level an attribute is in the formation of consumer preferences for a particular combination, i. e., the degree of preference for each level of an attribute (18). Table 1 shows the attributes and levels defined in the study. The levels established for the attribute \"DO\" correspond to Angol, Rengo and without information. The level \"Rengo\" was included because it is an important tomato-producing area in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region of Chile, which in 2013 concentrated the greatest proportion of surface (20.7%) with tradi tomato varieties commonly sold in the cities of this study . It is worth noting that the \"tradi - tional\" variety was the most widely cultivated in Angol 20 years ago, subsequently being replaced mainly by the \"long-life\" variety . The level \"pink\" was included as an example of a product with local tradition. The \"pink\" tomato is an old variety that has been cultivated in the Angol area for more than 100 years; its origin is associated with the Italian immigrants who arrived in the Lumaco area of the Araucan\u00eda Region. This is why it is considered the first cultivated tomato of that area. It has characteristics of color, size, shape and flavor that The presen - tation products DO are sold packaged (12). Size was included because it is one of the attributes that defines the quality in tomatoes perceived by consumers (15). The price levels were established on the basis of the lowest, highest and average prices of tomatoes at the time of the survey in the cities where the study was conducted. From these attributes and levels, a total of 144 combinations (3 x 4 x 2 x 2 x 3) were obtained; however, to facilitate the respondents' be used, obtained with the macro MktEx from the SAS Institute (21).

The DO, variety , size and the Seal of Origin program was only officially launched by the Government of Chile in July 2012 (35), the month prior to the application of the survey in this study. Therefore, the infor - mation about DO was presented verbally similar to the information presented on wine bottles that have DO in Chile.

A hierarchical cluster analysis was chosen to determine consumer segments according to the with the CLUSTER procedure of SAS. The number of clusters was taken on the basis of the R 2 obtained and a Pearson Chi-square ( 2) test was applied for the discrete variables and a one-factor analysis of variance was applied for the continuous variables (99% and 95% confidence level). The continuous variables which the Levene's statistic indicated homoge - variances, statistic indicated non-homoge - variances discussion In the sample of consumers surveyed, there were more women, people between 35 and 54 years of age, people from families with three to four members, urban residents, and people from socio - economic group ABC1. The majority of respondents indicated that they had not received any information on DO and did not know its meaning. Respondents predominated where tomatoes are eaten in the home three times per week. According to the results of the SWFL scale, satisfied 2, 181). No significant differences were observed between the samples of the Importance of the attributes and preferences Using a conjoint analysis, it was established that in the total sample, the attributes of greatest importance in the purchase of tomatoes were the variety, followed by DO and price.

In addition, the respondents preferred the tomatoes with Angol DO and rejected the Rengo DO and the product with no information. Likewise, preference was observed for the tomatoes large these of price: utility or preference became more negative as the price increased, indicating there is no association between price and quality.181Acceptance of a vegetable with designation of origin in two cities in southern Chile Tomo 47 N\u00b0 1 2015 Table 2 .

The RMSE of the conjoint analysis was 0.15, which indicated a good goodness-of-fit (table 3, page 182). The higher value placed on the attri- butes related to variety, DO and price have some implications for agricultural policy. These implications are related not only to the agrifood sector, but also to the tomato producers.182B. Schnettler et al. Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias Table 3.

In addition, the results of this study shed light on the importance of registering those DO that are in the country's interest to protect, considering the attribute. This avoids the proliferation of a DO that may not be valued by consumer markets. Since DO are recognized and protected by Law 19.039 of the Industrial Property Act (Art. 92) in Chile, it would be important to convene definition of DO for their products. In this sense, the local producers themselves would be participants in the regulation of DO. Consumer segments A cluster analysis distinguished three consumer segments with significant differences in the preference for most of the levels of the attributes (P0.001 or P0.05), except in the preferences for the of tomato (P>0.05) and the DO Rengo (P>0.1) (table 3, page groups also the impor - tance assigned to and price segments did not differ in the importance assigned to the DO or the presentation (package) (P>0.1).

Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias Group 1 \"Consumers sensitive to variety\" (n = 210, 52.5% of the survey sample): gave the greatest importance (significantly more than other groups) to the variety (51.8%). The people in this group preferred the varieties bunch and long-life, although they did not differ statistically from Group 2. It is worth noting that this was the group that showed the greatest preference for the long-life variety. Although the consumers in this group preferred the lowest price, similarly to the total sample, Group 1 stood out for the low importance assigned to the price (7.6%). This group also stood out for the significantly lower rejection of the tomato with no information about its origin (table 3, page 182). Group 1 presented the greatest proportion of women (83.8%) and those extremely satisfied with their food-related life (22.4%) (table 4, page 183). Group 2 \"Consumers sensitive to variety, preferred to pay a higher price\" (n = 52, 13.0% of the sample): although the most relevant attribute for this group was the variety, the group valued the size of the tomatoes (14.3%) significantly more than the other groups. Regarding the variety, consumers in this group preferred the varieties bunch and long-life, standing out for the greatest preference for the tomato bunch variety (table 3, page 182). Group 2 is distinguished as being the only one that showed positive utilities toward the three price the price indicates that these consumers associate price with quality. Group 2 had the highest proportion of men (34.6%), from families with five or (48.1%) and with food-related life page 183).Group 3 \"Consumers sensitive price\" = 138, 34.5% of the sample): assigned greatest importance to the price (30.4%), significantly more than the other groups. The people in this group showed the greatest rejection to the three price levels. The second most-important attribute was the variety of values were significantly lower than Group 1. This group stood out for the lower rejection of the \"pink\" variety. Group 3 was distinguished for the significantly higher preference for the tomato with Angol DO and for being the only one to prefer the small tomato, signif - icantly more so than the other groups (table 3, page 182). Group 3 had the greatest proportion of people somewhat satisfied with their food-related life 4, Regardless of the importance assigned to the attributes, the most preferred variety for all three groups was in bunch and the least preferred was the \"pink\" variety. Likewise, the three groups preferred the tomatoes in bulk, but when offered the packaged tomatoes, the three groups preferred the Angol DO. The preference for the bulk produce may be associated with the opportunity to choose each tomato individually for purchase. In this respect, it be mentioned that consumer preference for tomatoes in have negatively affected the impor - tance assigned to the DO. This may be due to the conjoint design used in this study, which considered the requirement products with DO must be sold this aimed to adjust to the INAPI norms for marketing product with certification of origin, it does not reflect the current form of marketing tomatoes in the cities studied in terms of the packaging.185Acceptance of a vegetable with designation of origin in two cities in southern Chile Tomo 47 N\u00b0 1 2015 Table 5.

This result suggests DO vegetables must also include consumer acceptance of the packaged product, DO negatively to share simulation. The largest market share (25.5%) was for the tomatoes without information about DO, long-life variety, small, at the lowest price. The next largest share (23.8%) was for the tomatoes with Angol DO, bunch variety, packaged in a tray, large, at the lowest price. The third largest share (16.0%) was for tomatoes with Angol DO, long-life, packaged in a tray, large, at the lowest price. It should be emphasized that the market participation of Angol 45.1%, long-life variety 45.5% bunch price reached 62.9%. The literature indicates that region of origin is used by consumers as a quality cue and food safety signal (37, 38); however, the results of the conjoint analysis reveal that the DO information was an attribute of secondary importance in both the total sample and the three consumer segments. This is consistent with previous studies into olive oil in France and Tunisia (8) and cider in Germany (38). The result of the total sample and that corresponding to Groups 1 and 2 (65.5% in total) is consistent with what was obtained by Schnettler et al. (2009) in a previous study on tomatoes, in which the variety was more important than the crop's area of origin. The results from Group 3 (34.5%) reflect the greater importance given to price over RO in lamb meat in South Africa (10). In this respect, the importance of information regarding the origin depends on the availability of additional information.186B. Schnettler et al. Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias Consumers will rely on origin labels only if no better indicator to evaluate the product is available (26), as is the case for the variety in this study. However, in Spain Resano et al . (2007) found that regional origin was the most influential attribute in the choice of cured ham. Therefore, it may be suggested that the importance of RO in the decision to purchase is associated with the country, the food and the attributes origin is compared to. Another aspect worth noting is the knowledge of the regions where the food is produced. In this regard, Teuber (2011) attributes the low importance of RO in Germany to the awareness and knowledge about GI and DO being very limited. Dekhili et al . (2011) determined that RO was more important in the election of olive in Tunisia than in producer of olive oil, and consumers identify the region where the oil is produced, whereas in France, where this product is imported, consumers give more importance to the country of origin. This underscores the importance of consumers being aware of the positive aspects of foods produced in a particular region, which must be communicated to consumers in order to be successful (38). This offers another possible explanation for the secondary importance of DO in this study, given that over 70% of the sample had no prior information about DO and did not know its meaning. Therefore, for the DO to be an attribute valued by consumers, the benefits associated with the DO must be conveyed beforehand so this attribute is positioned in the another possible cards did not certifi - to ensure such the seal of by of seal origin. the secondary importance of DO, the preference for tomato with Angol DO in the total sample and in the three segments partially value the regional origin of foods positively (3-9, 19, 23, 26, 37). Accordingly, the consumers did not prefer the product with DO over the one without this information, but rather they preferred only the product with Angol DO. This confirms the need for consumers to be aware of and know the region of origin (9, 16, 39), which is what occurred with the tomatoes produced in Angol in southern Chile, but not with tomatoes produced in other areas of the country, such as Rengo. Although these results suggest there would be acceptance of tomatoes with DO from Angol among consumers of southern Chile, because there would be knowledge of the product, the opposite effect is to be expected in cities of central Chile, where the Angolino tomato is likely not as well known and there is greater familiarity with the tomatoes produced in Rengo. This will have to be treated in new investigations in other cities in Chile. Despite the positive acceptance of the tomatoes with Angol DO, one relevant aspect for the producers to consider is the variety of tomato. The greater impor - tance assigned to this attribute over the origin in the total sample and the three segments indicates that the variety dominated consumer preferences in the choice of tomato, which is consistent with the previous study conducted by Schnettler et al. (2009).187Acceptance of a vegetable with designation of origin in two cities in southern Chile Tomo 47 N\u00b0 1 2015 Nevertheless, in that study the consumers preferred the traditional variety (Cal Ace) over the long-life variety. In this study the consumers preferred the tomatoes in bunch first and then the long-life tomatoes, which represents a change in consumer preferences. Although the causes of this behavior will have to be dealt with in future investigations, it is possible to suggest that the preference for tomatoes in bunch is related to the presence of the stems, which the consumer probably associates with greater freshness or a more natural product. With respect to the long-life variety, it is possible that the consumer has become accustomed to the constant supply of this tomato throughout the year, which has led to its longer life being valued over the traditional tomato, the supply of which is almost exclusively the summer months. The total rejection of the \"pink\" variety could be Angol DO must consider consumer preferences for the varieties, which according to the of study the impor - tance assigned to the variety and the price than for the DO information. However, the significantly higher presence of men in Group 2 than Group 1 is consistent with studies that report that men value the regional origin of foods more positively (9, 26). Indeed, the significantly greater preference of Group 2 for the tomato with Angol DO compared to Group 1 is also consistent with the results obtained However, the relation between gender and preference for Angol DO are not clear, because the greatest preference for Angol DO was in Group 3, which had a higher proportion of men than Group 1, but its gender profile did not differ statistically from the total is it possible to establish a clear relation between the size of the family group and consumer preferences, because the only segment that differed from the total sample was Group 2, which is not really big enough to be representative within the total sample. The differences in the degree of satis- faction with food-related life between the groups confirm the between satis-faction with food-related life and prefer - ences for foods different (34, 35). the cannot establish the affective regional products and the level of subjective well-being in the domain of food. However, there may be a relation between the level of satisfaction with food-related life and the importance assigned to price. Group 1 had the greatest proportion of people extremely satisfied with their food and was the one that assigned the least importance to price. By contrast, Group 3 greatest importance to this attribute and showed greater sensitivity to the increase in price, at the same time concentrating the highest proportion of people somewhat delve more into causes of this it is possible to suggest that a smaller preoccupation by the price of foods would affect a greater level of well-being. By contrast, if the consumer selects what foods to buy based mainly on the price, preferring clearly the lowest, their well-being in the domain of food can be clearly reduced in light of the restriction 188B. Schnettler et al. Revista de la Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias that price imposes on access to the desired foods. Although the segments did not differ by socioeconomic level, and this is not a problem of spending power, being able to choose foods priority to the price probably makes it possible to access food of better quality or to choose on the basis of personal preference, which would positively affect a greater level of satisfaction with food-related life. One aspect to emphasize is that significant differences between the segments were not detected according to the city of residence. This reaffirms the positive possibilities of a successful introduction of tomato with Angol DO not only in the Araucan\u00eda Region, but also in other cities in southern Chile. However , as has been suggested, the success of the launch of this product onto the market must be accompanied by a commercial strategy that incorporates promotional instruments that present this attribute to the consumer and communicate the advantages to acquire a product with DO. The development of DO endeavors to add value to food products (9), which according to the results of this study could affect the preference for the prepared to pay a higher price for this attribute, in contrast to what was reported by Brand\u00e3o et al . (2012) on meat with GI in Brazil. Therefore, considering the characteristics and preferences of the identified consumer segments, the focus should be on Group 1 as the target market for the introduction of the tomato with Angol DO. Although it was not the group that showed the greatest preference for the Angolino tomato, the low importance assigned to the price in the decision to purchase and the lower rejection of the packaged are that may facilitate acceptance by these consumers.Nevertheless, the producers must bear in mind the preferences for tomato varieties before introducing the tomato with Angol DO to the market. Limitations of this study include the non-probabilistic nature of the sample, which does not allow generalization of the results. At the same time, the sample is not representative of the country's population distribution. However, the consumer distri - bution in this survey was similar to the samples obtained in previous studies on supermarket consumers 34, 36). Therefore, although the results and conclusions of the present study may not be applicable to the whole population, they might be that variety was the attribute that dominated consumer preferences. The information referring to DO in tomato and price were attributes of impor and in bunch, with Angol DO at the lowest price. For the DO to be an attribute valued by consumers, the benefits associated with the DO must be conveyed beforehand so this attribute is positioned in the consumer's mind. From an agricultural policy point of view, the high value placed on the attributes variety and DO have implications not only to demand, but also to tomato producers.189Acceptance of a vegetable with designation of origin in two cities in southern Chile Tomo 47 N\u00b0 1 2015 Three market segments were identified with differences in gender, size of family group and degree of satisfaction with their food-related life. The first was sensitive to variety.The second was also sensitive to variety, but preferred to pay the highest price. The third was sensitive to price. All three segments preferred the tomato with Angol DO. Likewise, preferred long-life and bunch varieties. The results of this study indicated a good acceptance of tomatoes with Angol DO. However, a successful introduction of a tomato with Angol DO must consider consumer preferences for the varieties and package. This must be considered by the producers in the selection of the variety to cultivate, but it must also be taken into account by the retailers who market vegetables, in the sense of promoting the advantages associated with the purchase of these packaged products. Additionally, the launch of this product onto the market must be accompanied by a commercial strategy that incorporates promotional instruments that present the certification of origin to the consumer and communicate the advantages of acquiring a product with DO. Although the producers and retailers are responsible for these campaigns, the Ministry of Agriculture, through the Seal of Origin Program, must support the communicational strategies that the DO.
