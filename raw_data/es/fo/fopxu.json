Thus, the the conjugate vaccine could improve outcomes by antibiotic-resistant disease. Additionally, costs associated with could be substantially reduced, particularly in developing countries. The time has come for fully applying this new advancement against S. pneumoniae, to benefit the children of the world. The Spanish version of this paper is uno de los principales agentes causantes de enfermedades invasoras y no invasoras en la poblaci\u00f3n pedi\u00e1trica y sigue representando uno de los principales problemas de salud p\u00fablica a nivel mundial. La incidencia creciente de cepas resistentes a diversos antimicrobianos ha complicado el tratamiento y manejo de varias de las manifestaciones de la enfermedad neumoc\u00f3cica. Con \u00e9stas consideraciones, la mejor estrategia de manejo es la prevenci\u00f3n de \u00e9stas enfermedades a trav\u00e9s de la vacunaci\u00f3n. A pesar de que se han estudiado diversas vacunas neumoc\u00f3cicas conjugadas en ni\u00f1os, solo una vacuna 7-valente conjugada (PNCRM7; Prevnar\u00ae/Prevenar\u00ae) se encuentra aprobada para la prevenci\u00f3n de enfermedades invasoras en ni\u00f1os. La vacunaci\u00f3n con PNCRM7 es segura y efectiva en infantes y ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os. La vacunaci\u00f3n rutinaria con la vacuna conjugada podr\u00eda mejorar el resultado de los tratamientos, previniendo el desarrollo de cepas resistentes de S. pneumoniae y simplificando el manejo de las enfermedades neumoc\u00f3cicas. Adem\u00e1s, los costos asociados con el tratamiento de estas enfermedades se reducir\u00eda substancialmente, particularmente en los pa\u00edses en desarrollo. El tiempo ha llegado para aplicar este nuevo avance contra S. pneumoniae y obtener todos los beneficios que as\u00ed merecen los ni\u00f1os del mundo.

In a survey of 560 pneumococcal blood isolates from patients in Southern Sweden between 1981 and 1996, the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia increased from 5.2 to times the last two decades, as judged by the number of isolates of S. blood and 1993, surveillance studies in Latin American countries -coordinated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and performed by the Sistema Regional de Vacunas (SIREVA)-network- have revealed a high incidence of pneumonia and meningitis in children younger than two years of age. Children of this age group are more likely to be infected by pneumococci and the results of a pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PNCRM7; Prevenar\u00ae/Prevnar\u00ae), the objectives of to: a) review the characteristics and methods of transmission/carriage of pneumoniae; of diseases and rationale for vaccination against this pathogenic organism; and d) review efficacy been one of the most extensively studied microorganisms since its first isolation in 1881. In 1928, Griffith observed that when heat-killed encapsulated pneumococci could the encapsulated with same capsular type as the heat-killed strain.20 Years later, the nature of this therapeutic efficacy of penicillin; b) the role of the bacterial capsule in resistance to phagocytosis; c) the ability of polysaccharides (PS) to induce antibodies; the first demonstration of antigen-specific tolerance or e) the regulatory thymus-derived T lymphocytes; and f) the recognized as Pneumococci are lancet-shaped gram-positive bacteria that grow in pairs or short chains. The capsule of the bacteria consists of high-molecular weight polymers of repeating oligosaccharides, which contain between 2 and 8 monosaccharides. The capsule has long been recognized as the major virulence factor of S. pneumoniae. On the basis of difference in capsular structure, pneumococci be those in the incidence of certain S. pneumoniae serogroups have led to the that, from an epidemiologic standpoint, each should be considered as a potential is considered a constituent of the normal upper respiratory flora in humans and the main source of person-to-person transmission. Pneumococcal infections are preceded by bacterial colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosa,28 where the bacteria can persist as part of the commensal flora without causing disease. Nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae is more common in young children than adults, and children play an important role in the transmission of pneumococcal disease in the community, due to this high to adults without children is compared with carriage from 18% to 30% among adults with children. Carriage in preschool children is as high as 60%, in primary school children, 35%, and in high school students, 25%. The duration of carriage varies, depending on strain; include ability for recognition of and attachment to human nasopharyngeal cells and internalization to other body sites. Other events, often derived from the host, may contribute to the development of symptoms referable to the infected site. An excellent review of molecular events contributing to targeting pneumococci to various treatment on nasopharyngeal colonization. Dagan and associates investigated the dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in pediatric patients during the first pneumococci from 67% on Day 1 to 31% on Days 4 or 5. In contrast, cefaclor did not reduce pneumococci recipients on Day 1 of 25% of isolates were azithromycin-resistant. The study also showed that on Days 4 or 5, a new serotype was isolated in 16% of patients, 84% of which resistant Standards, with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.1 as having intermediate resistance to penicillin, and strains with an MIC of 2.0 \u00b5g/ml or are considered highly or fully resistant.32 Highly resistant strains they have become a worldwide in Boston first reported clinical resistance to penicillin in S. pneumoniae in 1965, did not recognize the significance of that resistance.34,35 Subsequently, this phenomenon was reported in Australia in 1967 and in South Africa in 1977, where strains with both a high level of penicillin Africa,36,37 Spain,38 Hungary,39 Czechoslovakia,40,41 Asia,42 and other European countries.46-48 In Latin American countries (i.e., Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay), the SIREVA network in 1998 studied 1 649 sterile-site isolates from children younger than 5 years of age. The study reported that 24.9% of group recently reported overall in children; since then, resistant strains have been shown to be more common in children than in adults. The reason for this association is unclear, but probably reflects the widespread use carry resistant strains, the coexistence the evolution of pneumococci suggests that the global increase in involves importation and spread of a small number of resistant clones, with advantages over local strains, in an environment in which antibiotics are often misused.53-55 The second is the in with modified interspecies or homologous recombinational events, or by the acquisition mutations pbp genes.52,57,58 and others that are under investigation that might play an important countries, studies from the SIREVA network done as part of a collaborative project with Rockefeller University in New York, have shown the presence of resistant international clones circulating in the region, mainly the Spanish 23F clone in Mexico and Colombia62,63 and the French 14 clone in Uruguay and Argentina.64,65 This suggests that a major part of the antimicrobial resistance within the region is due to the spread of a limited (pneumonia), respiratory tract (sinusitis), and auditory the preponderance pneumoniae-related mortality. Independent of race, children younger commonly occurs in the very young and the elderly; the spectrum of disease varies from an of pediatric CAP, has been demonstrated in European and North American settings. In Finland, in order to investigate the etiology of pediatric CAP, a prospective, conducted on the total population younger than 15 years of age (n=8 851) in municipalities. The number of patients was 201. Chest radiographs were for cases and paired sera for serologic assays were available for over 90% of cases. The specific of the patients. Bacterial infection was diagnosed in 102 cases (51%) and viral infection in 51 cases (25%). S pneumoniae was the most common agent with 57 cases (28%), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (22%), syncytial Chlamydia spp. (14%). H. influenzae was identified in only 6% and Moraxella catarrhalis in only 3% of the children. More than one specific infection was found in 51 patients (25%). The proportion of pneumococcal cases varied by age from 24% to 36%. Consistant with the results, patients months to years of age) with CAP, presenting to an emergency medical center in Texas.69 They used culturing, PCR, and to verify the bacterial pathogen of patients the study. Their results infection to S. pneumoniae in 27% of by M. pneumoniae in 7%, and Chlamydia pneumoniae prevalence of acute chronic sinusitis for vary widely. Between 0.5% and 5% infections may be complicated by acute sinusitis; in cases, S. pneumoniae, nontypeable H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis are the most common etiologic agents.70-73 Otitis media, the most common respiratory and early pathogens: pneumoniae, a lesser M. of media are implicated otitis media (35%-40% of cases) and the least likely to resolve without treatment.75-77 The disease affects at least 7 out of every 10 children; one third experience repeat episodes, and 5% to 10% of the cases develop chronic otitis media with effusion.78 In chronic otitis media with effusion, and sequelae the current birth cohort will have had a total of 9.3 million episodes of acute otitis media by the time they reach two years of age.80 In USA, the total annual treatment costs for otitis media and otitis media with increasing rate of resistance to rate of eradication of pathogens from middle ear fluid, which in turn, is associated with clinical failure. A bacteriologic cure rate of 80% to 85% is observed and nontypeable H. influenzae when serum concentrations exceed the a led to the emergence of S. pneumoniae strains that harbor resistance to multiple Despite antibiotic-resistant forms of the pathogen. As a component of public health policies, vaccines are the most cost-effective medical intervention and disease. Childhood immunization with vaccines represents the gateway to the provision of comprehensive healthcare which all children should be entitled.82,83 is especially important in developing countries, where more than 80% of the children up to one year of age could be vaccinated against six childhood diseases (UNICEF). Development of Pneumococcal Vaccines The history of the development of pneumococcal vaccines began early in the 20th century. However, the development of a vaccine with adequate coverage was complicated by the existence serotypes.24 obstacle was overcome with of a polyvalent vaccine through the persistent efforts of Dr. Robert Austrian. In 1977, a vaccine containing 14 of the most prevalent serotypes was licensed; of invasive pneumococcal isolates in the USA. In 1983, nine other serotypes were added (totaling 23 serotypes), increasing the total more of isolates in developed 23-valent polysaccharide (23PS) vaccine has been available for use persons older than two years S. pneumoniae been demonstrated in the USA and for several countries in for 23PS of 50% to 81% for vaccine-specific serotypes in adults with bacteremic disease.88-91 A major limitation with 23PS is that these vaccines are not immunogenic or protective in children younger than two years \u00be the age group at highest age prevaccination values within 3 to capsular antigens to In this way, the antigen acquires the immunogenic character of its carrier and now becomes recognized by the immune system as T-cell dependent. Proteins are broken down into peptides that associate with class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on the cell surface, and then are presented to T cells to antibody production Such infants, especially meningitis. In the USA between 1989 and 1997, the use of Hib conjugate vaccines vaccines carrier-mediated suppression of the antibody response; the frequency for immunization; c) the use of adjuvants; and d) the age and immunocompetency of the host.2,97 Fortunately, not all with pneumococcal disease.98 each serotype must be individually conjugated to the carrier, and there is concern about limiting the total dose of carrier protein to control carrier-induced tolerance.74,99 Other limitations may include the of vaccine would be required for administration if more conjugated 23PS was included and the overall cost of the vaccine. Serotype Specificity of Conjugate the of infections caused by serotypes included of conjugate vaccines and to evaluate the appropriateness of their use in various geographic areas and age groups, it was necessary first to understand the serogroup-specific epidemiology those the that 8 serogroups composed at least 75% of pneumococcal isolates in young children and 10 to 11 serogroups composed the same percentage of isolates adults. Serogroups in the 7-valent formulation (i.e., 4, 6, 9, 14, 18, 19, and 23) caused 70% to 88% of IPD in young children in the USA, Canada, Oceania, Africa, and Europe, and over 65% of IPD in Latin America and Asia. Serogroups in the 9-valent formulation (the 7-valent vaccine plus serogroups 1 and 5) caused 80% to 90% of IPD in each region except Asia (66%). Serogroup 1 accounted more than 6% of IPD in each region, including Europe, but not in the USA, Canada, and Oceania. In contrast, several conjugate (the 7-valent vaccine whether site (as a proxy for different disease states).101 In all age groups, serogroups 1 and 14 were more often isolated from blood, and serogroups 6, 10, and 23 were more often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. In young children, serogroups 3, 19, and 23 were more often isolated from ear from the cerebrospinal fluid of young children in Europe, the USA, and analyses in [Table several 7-valent conjugate vaccine was performed Anderson and associates.102 This study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and immunologic private practices. were vaccinated at four, and six months of age with Pnc-OMP, followed by a single dose of 23PS (n = 20) at 12 to 15 months of age. Thirteen infants who had not received Pnc-OMP as and were given a single dose of 23PS at 12 to 15 months of age. Pnc-OMP was well tolerated by the increasing to all seven serotypes after two or three injections. At 12 to 15 months of age, infants who had been primed with the conjugate vaccine had brisk immunologic 4 of the 7 serotypes and low responses to the other three serotypes. of 23PS. In 1997, Dagan and colleagues published a report detailing the safety a double-blind fashion (25 infants per group) at two, four, and six months of age. At 12 months of age, all 75 children were boosted with the conjugate vaccine groups than in the placebo group. After the booster with 23PS, both the geometric antibody greater higher in the Pnc-T or Pnc-D groups than pneumococcal was studied Mbelle on 9-valent vaccine was administered at ages 6, 10, and 14 weeks in a double- blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 500 infants in Soweto, South Africa. No serious local or systemic decreased in the group receiving PNCRM9 compared with the placebo group (18% vs 36%). However, carriage of nonvaccine-specific serotypes was found to be more (36% vs 25%), suggesting the potential for nasopharyngeal replacement by serotypes not included the penicillin-resistant pneumococci (21% vs and immunogenicity of PNCRM7 administered at two, four, six, and 12 vaccine (control). Concomitantly six months, and either measles-mumps-rubella vaccine or HbOC at 12 to 15 months. Active safety surveillance was conducted for 3 days fewer children experienced local PNCRM7 injection site than at the DTP/HbOC site. There was no increase in the incidence or severity of local reactions at the PNCRM7 site with increasing doses of the vaccine. Mild-to-moderate postvaccination fever was common in both the PNCRM7 and control vaccine groups, which may have been related to the concurrently administered DTP/HbOC. All seven of the immune responses was serotype-specific. After three doses of PNCRM7, 92% to 100% of children had an antibody of 0.15 \u00b5g/ml or greater, and 51% to 90% achieved a level of 1 \u00b5g/ml or against specific in 302 healthy infants in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, in which infants received either PNCRM7 or meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine (control) at two, four, and six months of age and a booster at 12 to 15 months.106 The primary objectives of the study were to: a) determine the safety and immunogenicity of PNCRM7 in infants, and b) examine the effects of concurrent hepatitis B immunization during the primary series and the effects safety and immunogenicity determined on before month after the primary series and the booster dose. of all subjects had a Postdose 3 titer of 0.15 \u00b5g/ml or greater for all serotypes, and the percentage of infants with a Postdose 3 titer of or greater ranged from 51% for serotype 9V After the and Predose 4 In the primary series, there significant given PNCRM7 alone concurrently hepatitis B vaccine. toddler dose, concurrent administration of PNCRM7 and a Postdose and Shinefield the results from a study conducted by the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center to determine the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PNCRM7 and its effectiveness against was to efficacy against clinical episodes of otitis media. The conjugate vaccine was administered to infants at two, four, and six months of age, followed by a booster dose at 12 to 15 months of age in a double-blind trial; 37 868 children randomly assigned PNCRM7 efficacy against estimated in an analysis of spontaneously draining ears. Through August 1998, no cases of pneumococcal infection due to vaccine serotype pneumococci had occurred in those children receiving PNCRM7. There were 17 cases of IPD caused by vaccine serotypes in fully vaccinated children and five among partially vaccinated cases in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 100%. Blinded case ascertainment was continued until April 1999. At that time, 40 cases of IPD in fully vaccinated children caused by vaccine-specific serotypes had been identified, all but one in the control group, for an efficacy of 97.4% (95% confidence interval, 82.7%-99.9%); and 52 cases in the intent-to-treat analysis, all but three were in the control group for an efficacy of 93.9% (95% confidence interval, 79.6%-98.5%). There was no 2000 after extensive research, PNCRM7 (Prevenar\u00ae/Prevnar\u00ae ) was licensed for use in the USA for the prevention of IPD in infants and young children caused by pneumoniae. The efficacy of PNCRM7 in preventing acute otitis media had been documented in the Kaiser Permanente trial as well as the Finnish Otitis Media trial (FinOM).103 of acute otitis media regardless of etiology was approximately 6% in studies. In the FinOM efficacy acute otitis and some associated replacement with nonvaccine serogroups. An increased nonvaccine serotypes; serotypes not included in the vaccine have the potential to be pathogenic as well.108 In the Kaiser Permanente trial there was no evidence of increased disease due to nonvaccine serotypes.

As shown in [Table III](#tabela3), administration of a reduced number of doses is recommended for children 7 to 23 months old who have not received previous doses of PNCRM7. Two doses of PNCRM7 are recommended for children 24 to 59 months old at high risk of IPD -including children [Table IV](/img/revistas/spm/v43n4/5902t4.gif)). Recommendations high-risk children of antibiotic prophylaxis in children younger than five years of recommended. Children who have IPD and who have received the recommended pneumococcal immunizations may discontinue prophylaxis after five years of age. The safety and efficacy of PNCRM7 and 23PS in children 24 months or older at moderate or low risk of invasive pneumococcal infection remains under investigation. Current FDA indications administration of PNCRM7 to children children at moderate risk of IPD, including all children 24 to 35 months old, children 36 to 59 months old who attend out-of-home care, and children 36 to 59 months old who are of Native American, Alaska Native, or African American descent. However, all children 24 to 59 months old, regardless of whether they are at low or moderate risk, may benefit from the administration of pneumococcal immunizations. Therefore, a single dose of PNCRM7 23PS be given to children 24 months or older. 23PS is alternative response and reduction favor Vaccination Against of US and associates designed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente randomized trial and other published and unpublished sources. The study used a hypothetical four, six, and 12-15 months), catch-up vaccination of children 2 to 4.9 years of age requiring one dose, and children receiving no intervention. Study objectives were the determination of cost per life-year saved and cost per episode of meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media prevented. would prevent more than 12 000 cases of meningitis and bacteremia, 53 000 cases of pneumonia, one million episodes of otitis media, and 116 deaths due to pneumococcal Before for vaccine costs, vaccination save $342 million in medical costs and vaccine cost less than $46 per dose, and savings for the if the vaccine cost less than $18 per dose. At the 000 per case prevented, and $28 000 per meningitis case prevented). The cost-effectiveness of an additional program to administer one dose of vaccine to children 2 to 4.9 years of age would vary, depending on the children's ages, relative risks and vaccine and of routine vaccination model was created to estimate the cumulative numbers of cases and costs to age 10 years for acute otitis media, tympanostomy and related procedures (TRP), and CAP children who did or did not receive PNCRM7. Seven hypothetical cohorts of 1 000 age at initial vaccination, were followed. Outcome measures included cost of numbers of cases of acute otitis media, TRP and CAP to age 10 years, and related disease costs, including medical treatment and parental 000 children against pneumococcal cost between $57 000 on age. Acute otitis media, TRP and CAP to age 10 years would decline by 139 cases to 330, by 8 cases to 22, and by 15 cases to 30, respectively; costs of medical treatment and work-loss to $15 000 for children younger than two years of age, and from -$1 000 to $31 000 for those 2 to 5 years of age at vaccination. Results showed that routine vaccination for children younger of age appears to be cost increasing, but would be cost-saving for children 2 to 5 years of age who would require only a single dose of the vaccine. There is little information at present, however, on the duration of protection afforded that pneumococcal disease decreases after five years of age. The study by Weycker and associates assumed that immunity would extend to age 10 years for children younger than two years of age at initial vaccination, but at half the initial rate after five years of age. Long-term potential of being cost-effective. The financial costs of medical use and work-loss resulting from common vaccine-associated symptoms are significant, and vaccines the that their use may increase carriage of and disease from serotypes not included Replacement has occurred Hib vaccines. In the controlled trial done Soweto, Africa by Mbelle and associates, results differ only in the linkage of a single sugar in the carbohydrate molecule, and it is of some concern that the vaccine did not reduce carriage of serotype of in the study was serotype 6A. to include extensive work Briles and associates regarding pneumococcal proteins and useful vaccine vaccines are PspA, PspC, pneumolysin, and In a mouse of PsaA and PspC were the most efficacious vaccine proteins. these proteins, was a recombinant family 1 PspA demonstrated that the protein was mice from these preimmune of the major PspA families (1 and 2) and both of the pneumococcal capsular types tested (3 been examined.

Concern about IPD among young children who present with fever of unknown origin is a common reason for antibiotic prescription in this age group. The importance of such empiric therapy has been questioned in may be reduced in settings with high vaccination coverage.124 formulations herein. Natural populations of pneumococci may switch and the selective pressure of conjugate vaccination may lead to resistance genes to strains with nonvaccine-associated capsules.125 As the capsule is the major virulence determinant of the pneumococcus, it is rates of in developing countries, the geographic and temporal variation S. pneumoniae from children and the more control and improve the outcomes of S. pneumoniae and other bacterial infectious agents. Summary As one of the leading causes of meningitis, pneumonia, and otitis pneumoniae represents a significant public health of pneumococcal disease has become complex because of S. pneumoniae; thus, the best only PNCRM7 is currently approved in the USA for the prevention of IPD in infants and young children. Vaccination with PNCRM7 is safe and effective in infants associated with treatment reduced. The cost of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may determine the ability of the to use these vaccines, for priorities.126 However, in light of the global importance of S. pneumoniae as a cause of illness, sequelae, and death, and the emergence of drug making these infections advances clinical and public health importance.127 Acknowledgments We are grateful to Kenneth Glinka for his careful review of the manuscript and helpful comments.
