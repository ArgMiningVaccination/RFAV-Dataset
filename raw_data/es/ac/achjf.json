The goal of this Study is to analyze how energy prices (those ruling until September 1992) could be raised to cover their economic costs and what effect this would have on the economy, on the level and structure of consumption, and welfare adjustments but they would still have important positive effects on public finances (on the fiscal deficit and its financing, thereby lowering inflation) and on price adjustments would cause modest increases in costs of production in general and have some negative effects on the welfare (and on the budgets) of low-income consumers (especially urban and rural The effect of higher prices on household budgets are being analyzed through a survey conducted in late 1992, whose results are presented and analyzed in a companion report, to be issued in the near future. 2. Very little hard data were available about the energy consumption habits of low-income households in Ecuador, although A recently completed report pricing in Latin America concludes that the share of and electricity is highly correlated with incomes. A survey of energy consumption (national, urban, and rural) commissioned by ESMAP appears to support the above conclusion also for Ecuador. 3. Since this Study was initiated, the government of Ecuador made important changes in the prices of energy products (on September 4, 1992 and in May 1993) which have gone a long way toward resolving the main issue analyzed in this report. While an effort has been made to clearly label \"prices\" as referring to either before or after the adjustment, this may not have been done everywhere. Generally, however, the context will make clear whether the \"prices\" referred to are those before or after the adjustment. Electric power tariffs were adjusted a second time, in May 1993. 4.

Executive Summary iii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. This report was written to assist the new Ecuadorean Government which took August 10, 1992, in taking urgent, important decisions with respect to energy pricing and energy sector reforms. Energy subsidies in Ecuador have been large, persistent and their social effect had never been verified, although the main justification for low prices had always been that they helped the poor. This subsidization policy has had a 20-year history; the first steps away from it were taken on September 4, 1992 with substantial price increases for oil products and electricity. 2. Low energy prices, and the concomitant subsidy (i.e. negative taxes), however, obvious year, energy typically exceeded the Consolidated Public Sector Deficit (for example, in recent years, the Consolidated Public Sector Deficit has varied between 1% and 4% of GDP; for 1991 the estimate of energy subsidies exceeds US$600 million or about 6% of GDP). Without access to external savings (except through the of between 50% and 80% p.a., that has existed during most of the last decade. 3. The rationale behind this report's recommendation to essentially eliminate energy subsidies is threefold: (a) The energy subsidies were, by and large, regressive (i.e., they helped the rich more than the poor); data from a recent ESMAP study of power losses show the highly regressive nature of electric power subsidies (see paragraph 1.32); as for oil products, the results of survey that has been recently taken broadly support this statement. (b) The elimination subsidies would go a long way toward reducing, if not eliminating the, generally small, structural public sector deficit and its associated, persistent rate of inflation. (c) Efficiency economic costs. Furthermore, energy would, of refined products to Colombia and Peru) and, in the longer run, stretch out Ecuador's crude oil reserves into less and consumed for any given growth in 1991 are estimated at million annually, about $400 million on petroleum products and about $223 million on electric power. The total subsidy to power users was about US$223 million and the subsidy per connection annum was US$1,092 for residential consumers kWh/month. Mission calculations that up until July of 1992 a major share of electric power subsidies (US$68 million out of a total of US$128.2 million all residential users) subsidy to power users was reduced to US$104.8 million per year, of which the lion's share (that is, 100%) went to residential users. As for petroleum, calculations made Chapter I, paragraphs 1-26.9 and Annex Tables 1-7) show to consumption of petroleum derivatives was equivalent to 4% of GDP, about equal to the total public sector deficit for that year. After the September pricing measures, the subsidy was by surpluses social and energy consumption was commissioned to obtain empirical data on the energy (especially modern fuels) by Ecuador's poor households. survey those obtained in countries. The of the survey are presented in a companion Report to be issued shortly. New Pricing Measures 5. With the new pricing measures enacted in September 1992, subsidies on oil consumption as a whole were eliminated and a surplus of US$3.4 million has emerged (only LPG, fuel oil and kerosene consumption are receiving a cross subsidy of about US$90 US $3.3 and million respectively,' measures taken represent a substantial step in the right direction, much still remains to be done. With the further gasoline price increase of February 1994 and the in world oil prices, average internal oil prices are now above the former. power, structure of tariffs needs to be changed to reflect the cost of service to different users, although the level of tariffs after the September 92 measures is close to 75% of LRMC. After the adjustment of May 93, tariffs are close to LRMC but their structure is not. This Report strongly recommends the implementation completed tariff study. While this ' It should be noted that these magnitudes are only approximations as there are no really accurate data on internal marketing costs. Furthermore, these magnitudes are changing daily (i.e. the surplus is being reduced) pari-passu with the depreciation of the Sucre and the variation in world prices of oil and oil derivatives. Executive Summary v report suggests some methodological improvements (see Annexes I, II and III), they represent refinements but do not imply that the implementation of the new tariff methodology should be delayed. In the case of petroleum products, the average price is now above versus has not been well thought the problems income households. While the new price cut the subsidy, the fact that low-income to LPG. This recommends of trade in kerosene to eliminate the monopolization from which it has suffered under the so-called \"Plan Bandera\" of restricted sales. As documented in Chapter IV and Annex 5 on the marketing of kerosene, none of subsidy on kerosene reached This report recommends the sale of kerosene at a reasonable discount diesel for correct the few remaining aberrations in energy pricing. First, with respect to electric power, there is, at present, no accepted system of raising tariffs; they have been fixed at the level set in September 1992,and adjusted again in May 1993. A socially-inspired, life-line for residential users could be justified but it should: (a) apply only to those consumers who use the life-line quantity, say, 50 kWh per month (and not to the first 200 kWh of all residential users as has been the practice recently); low income household uses less than 50 kWh/month; (b) be set as a percentage of the cost of service to those consumers, say, 50% so that t h e subsidy should not get out of hand and the price become so low that the costs of billing and collection exceed the sale revenue for these consumers; as has been the case until April 93; and (c) that this subsidy than specific cost of service. These measures are all consistent with the adoption of the new tariff methodology, serving the government should prepare a plan to raise the price of LPG to its economic cost over a reasonable period of time. The economic cost of LPG approximates the current import and internal handling and distribution costs. Alternatively, the average financial cost of supply (import plus domestic production) could be used as a price setting guide. This financial cost is of the order of about US $200/ton (rather than for internal distribution costs which is September near tripling to economic costs. Sold at financial cost, LPG would continue to have an economic subsidy, but not a financial one. 8. This Report further proposes that kerosene be chosen as the fuel for poorer households, especially those in suburban areas who do not have access to traditional fuels (which will continue being important in rural areas). Before kerosene can play this role, however, its marketing must be freed and its price must be raised to within a reasonable margin of those of Diesels 2 and 1 (which is really kerosene sold for industrial use). The current official price of S/.60 per gallon is merely the first in a chain of prices that reach to the final consumer. The final consumer price, especially in small quantities and in rural areas exceeds the price of its substitute (Diesel 1 at and larger quantities for industrial use, the upper limit of the price is set by Diesel 1. So, under the current system, virtually obvious that both prices be after it gasoline as there are only a few hundred users in Cuenca (and they should be compensated, possibly, with the gift of kerosene stoves replace their gasoline burners). revenues due higher energy prices could be enough to practically eliminate the fiscal deficit and allow an increase in social expenditures to compensate poor consumers. This would be so, provided that the price level and the exchange rate stabilize. If prices continue to to cutting the deficit but cause higher expenditures) then another round of price increases will be inevitable to maintain real prices at their September level (although some this help in keeping real oil prices estimated at nearly 2 (or about 17 years at the current rate of production) of which approximately 1.5 billion are of light crudes (API of 290) and the rest, of heavy crudes (API of 150 to 200). These reserve figures are higher than the official figures published by the National Directorate for Hydrocarbons, but lower than figures used by Petroecuador and the private oil companies. Similarly, the potential for increasing current output in the short run is the object of intense debate, with the private oil companies again being the most optimistic, claiming that output could be raised by 100,000 b/d, in the fields produced by Petroamazonas. This report suggests the truth may lie somewhere between the middle and high scenarios reported in the text (see below Annex this case, Executive Summary vii output would peak in 1996 at about 400,000 b/d but this would be highly dependent on massive investments (of the order of US$1.2 billion) by the private oil companies over 1992-95, as well as in the fields now operated by Petroecuador. Whether this investment is from public or private sources will depend on what happens to Petroecuador who is just entering the study phase of a privatization process. Since the public sector has neither the resources nor the enthousiasm (or the will) to commit itself to such high levels of expenditures, and the private sector is no longer excited about prospects, given the poor quality of low crude prices, investment will probably lag. 11. No exploration contracts were signed during the Borja Government (1988-92) decline significantly. or direct and opening up to foreign companies areas reserved for Petroecuador. In addition, discriminatory needs to be has the support of the new government's energy-policy makers. On the other hand, the huge enhanced recovery project proposed for the Petroamazonas fields seems no longer justified, and primary and secondary recovery methods are sufficient, for the time being, to recover almost as large a share of in situ oil than with the vastly more expensive tertiary methods. At the time of this writing, the seventh round of oil exploration negotiations was just setting under way (Dec 93). 12. In downstream activities, present refining, storage and pipeline capacities appear sufficient the short to medium term. Except for minor increases in crude oil storage and pipeline capacity (including use of the crude pipeline spur through Colombia) the only other investment that could be justified is a minor capacity increase in the Esmeraldas refinery, (and smuggling has already started to decline) and so, the additional refining capacity may well be postponed. Therefore, the idea of building a new grass-roots refinery in the Peninsula (with public funds) is an risky gamble of light Oriente Crude that can be refined at Esmeraldas will, for many years, exceed domestic demand while the output of likely remain below 50,000 b/d until the of the when there do so. Some efficiency gains, however, could be achieved by closing the refineries of the Peninsula while upgrading the Esmeraldas and, possibly, Amazonas refineries. viii Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution Electric Power 14. The financial crisis in the electric power subsector has been caused mostly by the lackof a forward-looking late 1970's and early 1980'sby large transfers of oil resources, which paid for major power investments over the last decade.This crisis has led to delays (of several years) in investments so that the system has no back-upcapacity for meeting incremental demand forthe medium energy constraintsare getting worse because the hydroelectric solutionsbut the thermal support plants that were required As result, Ecuador now hasto scramble to build gas turbines which may or may not be least cost, to meet demand over thecoming several years. In addition, the expansion plan calls for further investment on the Pauteriver, where 90% not been much can be gained in theshort and medium term by reviewing the generation expansion plan, in the longer run, such areview could help correct any potential flaw in the program, and should definitely be carried out,together with a general strengthening of the planning process to give greater weight to economicvariables, risk and the environment. Electric Power Subsector Reforms 15. Given the rather poor performance of the electric power subsector, this Study suggests thatmajor reforms are in order. These reforms regulatory framework, tariffpolicies and This report suggests that the new regulatory agency(possibly for the energy sector as a whole)2would need to be independent of the politicalprocess (as much as possible) yet have access to the highest levels of betechnically some excess manpower (especially in theEngineering and Projects, and Distribution and Marketing Departments) and cut lose theelectricity distribution companies (which could be easily privatized as they have the legal formsof private or has recentlybeen Bank funding this report recommends its speedyimplementation.

Executive Summary ix general manner, suggesting a broad framework of actions that need to be taken whatever the precise manner in which Ecuador ultimately decides to reform its power subsector. Similarly, a study should be undertaken to set up of competition, especially in downstream operations. x INTRODUCCION 1. El objetivo de este Estudio es analizar c6mo los precios de la energia (aquellos vigentes hasta septiembre de 1992) podrian ser incrementadog para cubrir sus costos econ6micos y que efecto esto tendria en la economia, sobre el nivel y la estructura del consumo, y en el bienestar de (especialmente) los consumidores de bajos ingresos. Los ajustes que se requieren son sustanciales, no gigantescos pero sin embargo tendrian efectos positivos importantes en las finanzas publicas (en el deficit fiscal y su financiaci6n, disminuyendo de ese modo la inflaci6n) y en la eficiencia econ6mica (mejora en la asignaci6n de recursos). El ajuste de los precios causaria en general modestos aumentos en los costos de producci6n y tendria algunos efectos negativos en el bienestar (y en los presupuestos) de los consumidores de bajos ingresos (especialmente en las comunidades urbanas y rurales de bajos ingresos, mujeres y ninios). El efecto de precios mas altos en los presupuestos de las familias esta siendo analizado a traves de una encuesta llevada a cabo a finales de 1992, cuyos resultados son presentados y analizados en un informe separado, que sera publicado en un futuro cercano. 2. Muy pocos datos concretos eran disponibles acerca de los habitos de consumo de energia de las familias de bajos ingresos en el Ecuador, aunque estudios hechos en otros paises latinoamericanos podrian ser considerados a grosso modo representativos. Un informe recientemente publicado, elaborado conjuntamente entre OLADE y ESMAP acerca del precio de la energia en Latino America concluye que la porci6n de los subsidios a la energia que efectivamente reciben los consumidores de bajos-ingresos es tipicamente pequefia debido a que el consumo de GLP, de la mayor parte de los productos derivados del petr6leo (excepto el querosen) y de la electricidad esta altamente correlacionado con los ingresos. Una encuesta sobre el consumo de energia (nacional, urbano y rural) encargada por ESMAP parece apoyar la conclusi6n anterior tambien para el Ecuador. 3. Desde que este Estudio se inici6, el gobierno del Ecuador hiz6 importantes cambios en los precios de los productos de la energia (el 4 de septiembre de 1992 y en mayo de 1993) que han contribuido sustancialmente a resolver la cuestion principal analizada en este informe. Aunque se ha hecho un esfuerzo para designar claramente los \"precios\" como antes o despues del ajuste, puede haber casos en que esta designaci6n no aparezca. Generalmente, sin embargo, el contexto aclarara si los \"precios\" referidos son aquellos antes o despues del ajuste. Las tarifas de energia electrica fueron ajustadas una segunda vez, en mayo de 1993. 4. El gobiemo del Ecuador cooper6 ampliamente con el equipo de estudio.

Este informe fue escrito para ayudar al nuevo Gobiemo Ecuatoriano, el cual se posesion6 el 10 de Agosto de 1992, en la toma de decisiones urgentes e importantes con respecto al precio de la energia y las reformas del sector de la energia. Los subsidios a la energia en el Ecuador han sido grandes, persistentes y su efecto social nunca habia sido verificado, a pesar de que la principal justificaci6n a los precios bajos siempre habia sido que ellos ayudaban a los pobres. Esta politica de subsidios ha tenido una historia de 20 afios; mas los primeros pasos apartandose de ella fueron dados el 4 de septiembre de 1992 con unos aumentos sustanciales en los precios de los derivados del petr6leo y de la electricidad. 2. El precio bajo de la energia, y el subsidio concomitante (ej. impuestos negativos), sin embargo, tuvo un impacto evidente en el desempefio macroecon6mico. En cualquier afno dado los subsidios a la energia tipicamente excedieron el Deficit Consolidado del Sector Puiblico (por ejemplo, en afios recientes, el Deficit Consolidado del Sector Piublico ha variado entre el 1% y 4% del PIB; para 1991 el estimativo de los subsidios a la energia excede los US$600 millones o cerca del 6% del PIB). Sin acceso a ahorros externos (excepto a traves de atrasos en el pago de la deuda) y con dificil y costoso credito interno, una gran proporci6n del Deficit Consolidado del Sector Puiblico ha sido financiado hist6ricamente a traves de la emisi6n monetaria. Estas causas explican ampliamente la tasa de inflaci6n persistente, que varia entre un 50% y 80% al aflo, y que ha existido durante casi toda la uiltima decada. 3. El raciocinio tras la recomendaci6n de este informe, de esencialmente eliminar los subsidios a la energia, es triple: (a) Los subsidios a la energia fueron, de una manera general, regresivos (ej. ellos ayudaron mas a los ricos que a los pobres); datos de un estudio reciente de ESMAP sobre perdidas electricas muestran la naturaleza altamente regresiva de los subsidios a la energia electrica (ver parrafo 1.32); para los productos derivados del petr6leo, los resultados de una encuesta que se hizo recientemente apoyan ampliamente esta afirmaci6n. (b) La eliminaci6n de los subsidios a la energia iria muy lejos hacia la reducci6n, sino a la eliminaci6n, del pequeflo deficit estructural del sector puiblico y la persistente tasa de inflaci6n asociada a este. (c) Se aumentaria la eficiencia,tanto en la demanda como en la oferta al fijar los precios de la energia a un nivel mas cercano de sus costos econ6micos. Ademas, a corto plazo, la conservaci6n de energia permitiria el crecimiento de las exportaciones (y precios mas altos desalentarfan el importante contrabando de productos refinados hacia Colombia y Peru), y a largo plazo, extenderia las reservas de petr6leo crudo del Ecuador hacia el futuro. Tambien habrian beneficios ambientales si menos energia fuera xiii producida y consumida para cualquier tasa de crecimiento y/o nivel del PIB. La Incidencia de los Subsidios a la Electricidad 4. Calculos hechos por la Misi6n muestran que hasta julio de 1992 una gran proporci6n de los subsidios a la electricidad (US$68 millones sobre un total de US$128.2 millones para todos los usuarios residenciales) se otorg6 a familias de mediano y alto ingreso. El subsidio total para los usuarios de electricidad fue de cerca de US$223 millones y el subsidio por conexi6n al afno fue de US$ 1.092 para consumidores residenciales que usaran 1.000 kW h/mes o mas, versus US$21.60 para aquellos que usaran menos de 80 kW h/mes. Despues del aumento de las tarifas de septiembre de 1992, el subsidio total para los usuarios baj6 a US$104.8 millones por afio, de los cuales la casi totalidad fue para los usuarios residenciales. En cuanto al petr6leo, calculos hechos para este informe (ver capitulo I, pirrafos 1-26.9 y cuadros Anexos 1-7) muestran que en 1991, el subsidio al consumo interno de productos derivados del petr6leo fue estimado en cerca de US$400 millones equivalente al 4% del PIB, casi igual al deficit total del sector publico de ese afio. Despues de las medidas de precios adoptadas en septiembre, el subsidio fue eliminado en terminos globales (precios intemos promedio, incluyendo impuestos, ahora exceden los valores CIF) y aunque un subsidio sustancial permanece para el GLP y el querosen, es mas que contrabalanceado por el superavit en otros productos, particularmente las gasolinas. En cuanto al impacto social, estudios hechos en paises vecinos muestran que, excepto por el querosen, los subsidios se correlacionan fuertemente con el ingreso y son por lo tanto regresivos. Una encuesta fue encargada para obtener datos empiricos sobre el consumo de energia (especialmente combustibles modemos) por familias pobres del Ecuador. El estudio esta casi completo, y sus resultados preliminares confirman aquellos obtenidos en paises vecinos. La totalidad de los resultados del estudio se da a conocer en un Informe complementario que sera emitido en breve. Nuevas Medidas de Precios 5. Con las nuevas medidas de precios tomadas en septiembre de 1992, los subsidios al consumo del petr6leo en conjunto fueron eliminados, y un excedente de US$3.4 millones ha surgido (s6lo el consumo de GLP, el combustible residual y el querosen estan recibiendo un subsidio cruzado de cerca de US$90 millones, US$3.3 millones y US$5.1 millones respectivamente,' financiado por los precios mas altos de la gasolina). Mientras que las medidas tomadas representan un paso sustancial en la direcci6n correcta, todavia queda mucho por hacer. Con el aumento adicional en el precio de la gasolina en febrero 1 Debe observarse que estas magnitudes son s6lo aproximaciones al no haber realmente datos exactos sobre los costos del mercadeo intemo. Ademas, estas magnitudes estan cambiando diariamente (ej. el excedente esta siendo reducido) a paso con la depreciaci6n del Sucre y la variaci6n en los precios mundiales del petr6leo y los derivados del petr6leo. xiv de 1994 y el reciente descenso de los precios mundiales del petr6leo, el promedio intemo de los precios del petr6leo esta ahora por encima del primero. En electricidad, la estructura de las tarifas debe ser cambiada para reflejar el costo del servicio a los diferentes usuarios, aunque el nivel de las tarifas despues de las medidas tomadas en septiembre de 1992 esta cerca del 75% de los CMLP. Despues de los ajustes de mayo de 1993, las tarifas estan cerca de los CMLP pero no su estructura. Este Informe recomienda firmemente la puesta en practica del sistema de tarifas propuesto en el estudio sobre tarifas recientemente acabado con fondos del Banco .Mientras que este informe sugiere algunas mejoras metodol6gicas (ver Anexos I, II y III), ellas representan refinamientos pero no implican que la implementaci6n de la nueva metodologia de tarifas debera ser aplazada. En el caso de los derivados del petr6leo, el precio promedio esta ahora por encima de los costos de oportunidad (US$0.63/gal6n versus US$0.57/gal6n valor CIF mas costo intemo de mercadeo) pero el problema de los combustibles de uso dometico no ha sido bien solucionado, especialmente en relaci6n con los problemas de las familias de bajos ingresos. Mientras que el nuevo precio del GLP cort6 el subsidio, el hecho de que los consumidores de bajos ingresos siguen siendo estimulados a usar el GLP (en lugar del querosen) sugiere que el gobierno no eliminara el subsidio restante al GLP. Este Informe recomienda la liberalizaci6n del comercio del querosen para eliminar la monopolizaci6n de la cual ha sufrido bajo el Ilamado \"Plan Bandera\" de ventas restringidas. Como ha sido documentado en el Capitulo IV y Anexo 5, en el mercadeo del querosen, casi nada del subsidio al queros6n llega a los consumidores pobres. Este informe recomienda la venta abierta del querosen a un descuento razonable del diesel (no con el inmenso diferencial que actualmente existe, a saber S/60 por gal6n de querosen versus S/1460 por gal6n de los diesels 1 y 2) y la facilitaci6n del abastecimiento de estufas eficientes de querosen a los precios mas bajos posibles. 6. Este Informe ademas sugiere algunas medidas especificas para corregir las pocas aberraciones que quedan en el precio de la energia. Primero, con relaci6n a la energia electrica, no hay actualmente un sistema aceptado para el aumento de tarifas; ellas han sido fijadas al nivel determinado en septiembre de 1992, y ajustadas una vez mAs en mayo de 1993. Una tarifa socialmente-inspirada, \"life-line\" para usuarios residenciales se podriajustificar, pero deberia: (a) aplicarse s6lo a aquellos consumidores que usen menos de la cantidad \"life-line\", por ejemplo, 50 kWh por mes (y na a los primeros 200 kWh para IQdo los usuarios residenciales como ha sido la prictica hasta recientemente); el promedio de las familias de bajos ingresos usa menos de 50 kWh/mes; (b) fijarse como un porcentaje del costo del servicio a aquellos consumidores, por ejemplo, 50%, para que el subsidio no se vuelva inmanejable y el precio baje tanto que los costos de facturaci6n y cobranza excedan los ingresos por ventas a estos consumidores; como ha sido el caso hasta abril de 1993; y xv (c) que este subsidio sea directamente financiado por el Presupuesto del Estado o, menos justificable te6ricamente, mediante el cobro a los consumidores mas adinerados ligeramente mas que el costo especifico de servirlos. Todas estas medidas son consistentes con la adopci6n de la nueva metodologia de tarificaci6n, es decir, el establecimiento de una estructura de tarifas que refleje los costos del servicio de cada categoria de usuarios. 7. Segundo, con relaci6n a los hidrocarburos, el gobiemo debera preparar un plan para aumentar el precio del GLP a su costo econ6mico en un periodo razonable de tiempo. El costo econ6mico del GLP se aproxima a los costos presentes de importaci6n, manejo intemo y distribuci6n. Alternativamente, el promedio de los costos financieros de suministro (importaci6n mas producci6n domestica) podria ser usado como guia para establecer un precio. Este costo financiero esta por el orden de US $200/ton (en vez de US $260-300/ton por costo de importaci6n mas US $100/ton por costo de distribuci6n interna el cual es actualmente considerado el costo econ6mico) y por lo tanto requerira duplicar aproximadamente el precio de septiembre de 1992 en vez de casi triplicarlo para alcanzar su costo econ6mico. Vendido al costo financiero, el GLP continuara teniendo un subsidio econ6mico, mas no uno financiero. 8. Este Informe ademas propone que el querosen sea escogido como el combustible para las fanilias mas pobres, especialmente aquellas en las areas suburbanas donde no se tiene acceso a los combustibles tradicionales (que continuaran siendo importantes en las areas rurales). Sin embargo, antes de que el querosen pueda desempefiar este rol, su comercio debera ser liberalizado y su precio aumentado hasta liegar a un nivel razonable en relaci6n con el precio del Diesel 2 y I (que es realmente querosen vendido para uso industrial). El actual precio oficial de S/.60 por gal6n es tan s6lo el primero en la cadena de precios que liega al consumidor final. El precio final al consumidor, especialmente en pequefias cantidades y en areas rurales excede al precio de su sustituto (Diesel 1 a S/1460 por gal6n). Cuando el querosen domestico es arrinconado y vendido en grandes cantidades para uso industrial, el limite superio del precio es establecido en base al Diesel 1. Por lo tanto, bajo el sistema actual, virtualmente ninguno de los ingresos no percibidos por el Estado (S/1460 -60 = 1400/gal6n de lucro cesante) beneficia a los consumidores de bajos ingresos pero si a usuarios industriales. Es obvio que ambos precios deberian ser aumentados simultaneamente despues de que sean tomadas las medidas para mejorar el suministro de estufas mas eficientes de querosen .El querosen dej6 de ser distribuido para uso residencial en junio de 1993, o mas bien dej6 de ser vendido a S/60 por gal6n. Adicionalmente, el abastecimiento de la Ilamada gasolina \"regular\" podria ser eliminado ya que hay s6lo unos pocos cientos de usuarios en Cuenca (y ellos deberian ser compensados, posiblemente ,con la donaci6n de estufas de querosen para reemplazar los quemadores de gasolina). 9. Finalmente, los ingresos adicionales provenientes de los precios mas altos de la energia podrian ser suficientes para eliminar practicamente el deficit fiscal y permitir un xvi aumento en gastos sociales para compensar a los consumidores pobres. Esto podria ser, con tal de que el nivel del precio y la tasa de cambio se estabilicen. Si los precios continuaran subiendo (o sea, que los ingresos adicionales no corten el deficit sino aumenten los gastos) entonces otra ronda de aumento de precios sera inevitable para mantener los precios reales al nivel de septiembre, (aunque algunos aumentos selectivos de precios fueran todavia necesitados, por encima de los precios de septiembre ej., para el abastecimiento de GLP, querosen y electricidad para uso residencial). Afortunadamente, sin embargo, la inflaci6n parece estar disminuyendo y esto ayudaria a mantener los precios reales del petr6leo constantes, sin tener que aumentar los precios nominales frecuentemente. Asuntos sectoriales de mediano plazo 10. Reservas Petroleras y Producci6n: En la actualidad (finales de 1992) el total de reservas probadas de petr6leo crudo esta estimado en cerca de 2 mil millones de barriles (o alrededor de 17 afios a la presente tasa de producci6n) de los cuales aproximadamente 1.500 millones son de crudos ligeros (API de 290) y el resto, de crudos pesados (API de 15'a 200). Estas cifras de las reservas son mas altas que las oficiales publicadas por la Direcci6n Nacional de Hidrocarburos, pero mas bajas que las usadas por Petroecuador y las compafnias petroleras privadas. Igualmente, el potencial para incrementar la actual producci6n a corto plazo es objeto de un intenso debate, siendo las compafnias petroleras privadas una vez mas las mas optimistas, sosteniendo que la producci6n podria ser aumentada de 100.000 barriles/dia, principalmente en los campos de producci6n de Petroamazonas. Este informe sugiere que la verdad se ubique en algun lugar entre la situaci6n media y alta reportadas en el texto (ver mas adelante Cuadros Anexos 18-20). En este caso, la producci6n Ilegaria a su maximo en 1996 con cerca de 400.000 b/d pero esto dependeria de inversiones masivas (del orden de US$1.200 millones) por las companiias petroleras privadas durante 1992-95, asi como en los campos operados por Petroecuador. Que esta inversi6n provenga de una fuente puiblica o privada dependera de lo que suceda con Petroecuador, quien esta entrando en la fase de estudio del proceso de reestructuraci6n. Ya que el sector publico no tiene ni los recursos ni el entusiasmo (o el deseo) en comprometerse en tan alto nivel de gastos, y el sector privado no estA entusiasmado con las perspectivas, dada la baja calidad de los recientes hallazgos y los bajos precios del crudo, la inversi6n probablemente se retrasara. 11. Durante el Gobierno del Dr. Borja (1988-92) no se firmaron contratos de exploraci6n lo cual necesita ser remediado para evitar un descenso precipitado en las reservas de petr6leo, especialmente si la producci6n actual aumentara significativamente. Este informe sugiere la simplificaci6n de la legislaci6n de exploraci6n producci6n compartida/ \"production sharing agreements,\" concesiones o negociaciones directas), y hacer accesible a compafias extranjeras de petr6leo areas reservadas para Petroecuador. Fuera de esto, la tributaci6n discriminadora de las companlias extranjeras de petr6leo debe ser eliminada -esta medida tiene el apoyo xvii de los responsables de la politica energetica del nuevo gobiemo.2 Por otro lado, el inmenso proyecto de recuperaci6n mejorada propuesto para los campos de Petroamazonas parece no justificarse mas, y los metodos de recuperacion primaria y secundaria son suficientes, por el momento, para recuperar una proporci6n de petr6leo in situ casi tan grande como con los metodos terciarios sustancialmente mas caros. En el momento en que se escribi6 esto, la septima ronda de negociaciones de exploraci6n de petr6leo estaba empezando. (diciembre de 1993) 12. En actividades posteriores a la extracci6n (downstream), la presente capacidad de refinaci6n, almacenamiento y oleoductos parece suficiente para el corto y mediano plazo. Excepto por aumentos menores en el almacenamiento de petr6leo crudo y en la capacidad de los oleoductos (incluyendo el uso del ramal del oleoducto de Colombia) la unica otra inversi6n que podria ser justificada es un aumento menor en la capacidad de la refineria de Esmeraldas, y, posibles inversiones en Balao que permitan la operaci6n de tanqueros de crudo mas grandes. Dadas las politicas de precios mas correctas introducidas recientemente, el pron6stico de crecimiento en la demanda domestica de los derivados del petr6leo probablemente disminuira (y el contrabando ya ha comenzado a descender), por lo tanto, la necesidad de capacidad adicional para refinaci6n bien puede ser postergada. Por lo tanto, la idea de construir una refineria completamente nueva en la Peninsula (con fondos puiblicos) es unajugada innecesaria y arriesgada que afortunadamente, el gobiemo resolvi6 abandonar. 13. Igualmente, ninguno de los esquemas de desarrollo refinero basados en la refinaci6n de crudos pesados deberia considerarse seriamente en la actualidad. El abastecimiento de crudo liviano de Oriente que puede ser refinado en Esmeraldas, por muchos afios, excedera la demanda domestica mientras que la producci6n de crudos pesados muy posiblemente permanecera por debajo de los 50.000 b/d hasta el final del siglo. Pareceria imprudente comprometer al Ecuador en inversiones de refineria que excedan los US$1.000 millones cuando no hay una necesidad apremiante para hacerlo. Sin embargo, algunas mejoras en eficiencia, podrian lograrse cerrando las refinerias de la Peninsula y mejorando a la vez las refinerias de Esmeraldas y, posiblemente, Amazonas. Energia Electrica 14. La crisis financiera en el subsector de la energia electrica ha sido causada principalmente por la falta de una politica tarifaria con miras al futuro. Este problema fue encubierto a finales de los 70 y principios de los 80 por amplias transferencias de recursos del petr6leo, que pagaron por las grandes inversiones electricas en la decada pasada. La crisis ha llevado a demoras (de varios afios) en las inversiones, por lo tanto el sistema no tiene una capacidad que cubra la demanda incremental (aunque el crecimiento de la demanda puede disminuirse debido al reciente aumento en las tarifas.) y puede 2Esta ya se hizo; y la septima ronda de negociaciones petroleras, usando lo que es, en esencia, un production-sharing agreement, esta teniendo buen exito. xviii enfrentar severas restricciones de capacidad y de energia inmediatamente y por el t6rmino medio, tanto en t6rminos de generaci6n como de transmisi6n. Las restricciones de energia en temporada de sequia se estan empeorando ya que el sistema de planeaci6n ha favorecido las soluciones hidroelectricas pero las plantas de apoyo termicas que eran requeridas nunca fueron construidas. Como resultado, Ecuador ahora tiene que bregar para construir turbinas a gas las cuales pueden o no ser lo menos costoso para satisfacer la demanda de los pr6ximos afnos. Fuera de esto, el plan de expansi6n requiere una inversi6n adicional en el rio Paute, donde esta localizado el 90% de la capacidad hidroelectrica del Ecuador y la factibilidad tecnica de construir Paute Mazar no ha sido todavia firmemente establecida. Mientras que a corto y a mediano termino no es mucho lo que se puede ganar revisando el plan de expansi6n de generaci6n, a la larga, esta revisi6n podria ayudar a corregir cualquier falla potencial en el programa, y definitivamente deberia ser lievada a cabo, junto con el fortalecimiento del proceso de planeaci6n para dar mas peso a las variables econ6micas, riesgo y ambiente. Reformas en el Subsector de Energia Electrica 15. Dado el mas bien debil desempefno del subsector de la energia electrica, este estudio sugiere que se necesitan reformas sustanciales. Estas reformas deberian afectar el marco regulatorio,la politica de tarifas y la reorganizaci6n institucional. Este Informe sugiere que la nueva agencia regulatoria (posiblemente para el sector de la energia en conjunto)3necesitaria ser independiente del proceso politico (tanto como sea posible), pero tener acceso a los niveles mas altos del gobierno y ser tecnicamente excelente, a fin de conseguir credibilidad inmediata con las autoridades y empresas del sector. INECEL deberia dejar sus funciones regulatorias, concentrandose en la generaci6n y transmisi6n (ej. Ilegar a ser una verdadera empresa), deshacerse de parte de su exceso de personal (especialmente en los Departamentos de Ingenieria y Proyectos, y Distribucion y Mercadeo) e independizar a las companiias distribuidoras de electricidad (las cuales podrian ser facilmente privatizadas ya que tienen la forma legal de compafiias de responsabilidad limitada). Bien sea de propiedad privada o puiblica, INECEL se beneficiaria de la competencia de generadores privados independientes. Un estudio a fondo sobre las politicas tarifarias ha sido recientemente completado por INECEL con fondos del Banco y este informe recomienda su acelerada implementaci6n. Puesto que un estudio que sera financiado bajo un proyecto en curso del Banco considerara aspectos regulatorios y reformas institucionales, este informe s6lo trata estos asuntos en una forma general, sugiriendo un amplio marco de acciones que necesitan ser tomadas cualquiera que sea la manera precisa en la cual Ecuador decida reformar su subsector electrico. Igualmente, debe ser emprendido un estudio para establecer la estructura de precios y de tributaci6n de los derivados del petr6leo que permitira la desregulaci6n del subsector de 3 El regulador s6lo establecera los precios del petr6leo basado en los precios del mercado mundial, durante la transici6n hacia un pleno mercado libre del petr6leo, ej. el regulador tendra simplemente el poder de observar y reunir informaci6n acerca del comportamiento del mercado domestico del petr6leo para ayudar a establecer y luego a mantener un mercado libre y abierto. xix los hidrocarburos y la introducci6n de competencia, especialmente en operaciones posteriores a la extracci6n (downstream). 1 ANALYSIS OF ENERGY PRICES, SUBSIDIES AND STATE REVENUES Introduction 1.1 The present chapter reviews the evolution of energy prices since 1980, estimates size and pricing policies. It is worth noting in this connection that public sector prices as well as the foreign exchange rate were fixed between 1972 and 1981. In the subsequent years, the Ecuadorian economy the longer-run, though, higher inflation, in combination with the fixed exchange to a oil and a declining quantity of bananas. At the time, revenues spent on and the used to subsidize everything else, from antibiotics to credit. 1.2 As is shown in the following paragraphs, real energy prices were low (indeed, below economic cost) in 1980 and have since declined almost constantly, with the exception of 1981 and 1988 when unsuccessful steps were taken to reverse this trend. For instance, by 1991, electricity tariffs for residential users and household fuel prices were down to 53.9% and 35%, respectively, of their 1980 levels (see Tables 3 and 4). 1.3 The subsidies on petroleum products and electricity, which reached 6% of GDP in 1991, used to account for a major share, if not all, of the fiscal deficit. In the mid-1980s, when external borrowing became more difficult, Ecuador by incurring arrears and creating credit. This caused a surge in inflation, with rates ranging between 50% and 80% per annum. As is argued below, energy prices closer to economic costs can help cut the ballooning fiscal deficits and, by obviating the need to create money (to finance the government deficit), reduce inflation. 2 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies Substitution of fuels for the domestic market imports, but net of exports) are required to comply with some concept of historic accounting cost. They thus do not less, been topolitical rapidly because ofinflation. In oil product been revised when revenues of the State'sGeneral Budget (Presupuesto General del -PGE) from domestic sales proved totally insufficient so that an immediate cash 1989, the preceding administration Real prices, therefore, resumed their decline increases of September 1992, followed by a new round of increases in May 1993. Thus, the new government pursues a policy of discrete in adjustment pursued in the past provided no guidance for the economic use of scarce and valuable resources fact, the policy for setting fuel prices and electric power was touted asa groups who ownprivate cars. The subsidies on kerex, which is no longer available to households at its low official price, have been dissipated among a new breed of (see fuel, an even larger amount of the hand-outs has been enjoyed by the affluent households. 1.8 good example is LPG which sold not only below cost, but also below the price of electric power and other substitute fuels. As aconsequence, LPG is now used by many households on a large scale and in a variety of activities where other fuels are more economic or could prove a competitive alternative. Since LPG, of Analysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 3 which a large share has to be imported (51% in 1991), sells at a high loss, this policy prompted a major drain on public sector resources (see paragraph 1.27 and Annex IV). 1.9 The new pricing structure put in place in September 1992 still implied cross subsidies among the different The price household LPG accounted for 34.6% and that of kerex for only 5.3% of the average price of all oil products. Gasolines, on the other hand, were priced 110.2% (Super) and 27.9% (Extra) above the average. Moreover, the new domestic price structure did not match the structure of costs at import parity (see Table 1). also be noted that since the entire proceeds from sales in the domestic market accrue to the state treasury, there is no such thing as a \"net of tax\" price which could be considered a \"producer\" price. For this reason, it is suggested to establish a pricing and taxation framework that distinguishes between producer prices and the taxes added on for the purpose of raising public revenue.

Although expansion of the Shushufindi gas plant would reduce imports and cover a greater of national consumption, the expected replacement of LPG imports has not yet place. At any rate, the present situation is favor of use efficient way. 1.12 Until September 1992, household LPG, which in 15 kg cylinders, sold for S/80/kg (US$ 0.05 per kg), far below the international price Petroecuador reported to pay for imports (US$ 265 per metric ton CIF). Even worse, this failed to cover the costs of storage, bottling, bulk and retail transport and the distributors' margin, which at that time added up to an average of S/120/kg. LPG for industrial and commercial use had a much higher price (US$0.30 per kg) more closely reflecting economic cost, but in practice, attracted only few customers as the price differential was overwhelmingly in favor of the 15 kg cylinder. Since September 1992, LPG has been priced at S/193 per kg, equivalent to USc 10.7 per kg (at an exchange rate of S/l1,900 per US$ as of May 1993), while the price of LPG for industrial use has been S/564 per kg (about USc31.3 per kg). In late 1993, economic cost (import parity plus downstream expenses), though, was less than its costs. 3 In 1985, gasoline consumption was about in the same year, per-capita consumption was very much lower in Peru than in Ecuador (0.047 barrels per capita versus 1.14 barrels per capita). Analysis of Energy Prices, Subsidies and State Revenues 5 1.13 Before the September 1992 adjustments, the price of diesel, measured in terms of useful energy, amounted to 85% of the price of gasoline. Thereafter, the price differential has been narrowing to the point where prices are on a par. Inefficiencies in vehicle fuel consumption, however, remain high, mainly because transport fleet, but also because the fuels' price level was still too low to encourage conservation. 1.14 Kerex distribution through regular service stations was discontinued in 1991 when Petroecuador changed its marketing policy. In order to stem the diversion of this highly subsidized product toward industrial decided the supply of kerex to so- called traditional markets in cities and other urban and rural outlets, agents such at low-income groups. On the contrary, the restricted marketing of kerex has led to the cornering of its supply by a few major middlemen. Moreover, as a response to the large differential between the official kerex price of S/60 and the of Diesel 1 and Diesel 2 (S/630 and S/1,460 before and after the adjustment, respectively), a black market, with a chain of middlemen, has developed around this product. In fact, kerex is nowhere available at its residential been charged between and S/650 per gallon or even more in remote rural areas. After the adjustments, the average retail price soared to S/1,360 per gallon. In-the-field research done for this Study indicates that only 45% of the kerex supply ends in household appliances. Consequently, the beneficiaries from being 1992, petroleum product prices (not including fuel oil), adjusted for inflation, were lower than in the preceding year, but still higher than in 1980, except for kerex and LPG which sold at 63% and 27% of their 1980 price levels (see Table 3).

Electric Power Tariffs 1.18 Pursuant to the Basic Electrification Law, tariffs of Directors sets electric power tariffs on the basis of information provided by the power utilities. 1.19 The tariff structure is based on different consumer groups and end commercial, industrial, public lighting on the costs of and of use, which would be more appropriate. In addition, there are charges for demand of to residential This is opposite to the policy applied in most Latin American countries where industrial tariffs on average are lower than residential and commercial tariffs, thus accounting for differences in the cost of service and load characteristics. 1.20 While there is a uniform tariff system for non-utility users throughout bulk power sold by INECEL to utilities (which in many cases are mere distribution companies) are discriminatory. In 1991, the average bulk tariff was USc 1.68 per kWh. Small distribution companies or those with financial difficulties are offered the lowest prices for both contracted 1991, the highest average wholesale rates were charged to the Cotopaxi and Quito utilities (USc 2.01 per kWh and USc 1.95 per kWh, respectively) and the lowest were billed to the Milagro and Bolivar utilities (USc system was created to favor utilities supplying unattractive markets with of small customers, thus fostering effects on efficiency, both for those utilities paying more and those protected. An alternative approach would be to set bulk power rates more in line with the different costs of supply and, at the same time, let the utilities have the discretion to taylor the retail tariffs to Energy Pricing, fuel prices, electric power tariffs have been handled with a to redistribute income toward poorer consumers, a goal which has only been achieved to a limited extent. On the other hand, what the low level and distortive structure of the tariffs have brought and been given to rate setting, that of providing sufficient and distribution companies. The tariffs prevailing until September 1992 did not even cover and much less the financial requirements of supply to meet future demand. While the average tariff in 1991 was USc 3.23 per kWh, the cost at the retail level amounted to USc 5.62 per kWh. This imbalance aggravated INECEL's poor financial and economic condition. In 1991, power sales accounted for only 52.2% of the Institute's cash flow requirements (the balance was made up of government transfers and borrowing). The low share of revenues accounted for by power sales, together with INECEL's high debt and the parallel reduction in National Government contributions, which accounted for 42.4% of its cash flow in 1991, and 43.6% in the period between January and June 1992. In fact, INECEL was receiving in excess of US$100 million/year in oil transfers between the mid 1970s and 1985. Thereafter, oil transfers fell to about US$50 million in 1986 and US$20 million in 1987, becoming negligible after 1988. 1.22 In 1989, INECEL resorted to automatic, monthly rate adjustments of 3% in protect the (real) value against the detrimental effects of inflation. However, the first 80 kWh/month, and from November 1990 onwards, the first 200 kWh/month of all residential customers, as well as the first 80 kWh/month of users not subjected to a demand charge were exempted from this rule. The tariffs on these special blocks increased in line with the rise in the minimum 200 the September price reform, but commercial users were no longer entitled to benefit from the freeze. 1.23 Table 4 shows that, in constant Sucres, the average tariff paid by the residential sector during the period 1986-1991 was lower than in 1980 (the 1991 tariff was 53.9% of the 1980 tariff and the average tariff of 1991 was 84.5% of the tariff) prevailing 1980. Although the average industrial sector tariff ended up 31% higher in 1991 than in 1980, this was not sufficient to match the system's operating costs. As a situation allow both INECEL and the distribution companies to improve their cash flow and start covering their costs.

These figures are fairly close to the estimates based on opportunity cost imputed the size of the subsidy on oil products to the domestic consumer is to look at the value added of oil refining in the National Accounts. This a negative value of production at domestic market prices. Between 1986 and 1992, this negative value has increased by 47%, from S/6.4 billion in 1966 to S/9.4 billion in 1992 (in constant prices of 1975). These figures are broadly consistent with the two estimates presented above, i.e., opportunity cost of products; opportunity cost of crude.

This may pose social problems that the Government has to cope with. In fact, many of the urban mass transport passengers belong to the lower income upward adjustment of fuel prices, each urban mass transport vehicle receiving a subsidy of S/600,000 (US$ 310) a month to keep the fares fixed. But the transportation associations, which wield considerable power, have been fighting to raise fares. 1.37 Another important sector that would be impacted is electricity generation, since oil products account for about 15% of the intermediate demand of the power generation industry 5 According to a study conducted by the National Energy Institute (Instituto Nacional de Energia), prior to September 1992, fuel accounted for 23% of total operating costs in urban bus transportation. So the price increase of September 1992 may just have had the predicted effect on total transport cost. 16 Ecuador: Energy and Interfuel Substitution (although is generated by hydropower, with a 77.03% share in 1991). The burden that higher fuel prices place on electric power could rise even more asa result of the increasing share of thermal generation which is due to unusually low precipitations in recent years. 1.38 This Study used the input-output matrix of the Central Bank to estimate the short- term impact of changes in oil product prices and electricity tariffs on production costs, the general price index and the export price index. The latter was included because of the importance the external sector to the economy. To this end, the matrix, which covers, 34 sectors was consolidated into 17 by merging similar sectors and singling out those with a high energy intensity. The matrix with the latest information was that of 1989. Only increases in energy costs were taken into account and not those of other primary inputs. In addition, it was assumed that the cost to imput-output that the price elasticity of energy demand is zero. All this is truer in the short-term than in the medium to impact the cost increases to some extent. 1.39 The findings show that the chemical and basic mineral industries, among which is the cement industry, would experience an increase in production costs of 9.1 % and 8.4%. The construction sector would suffer from a 6% rise in cost. Thus, even in the case of energy- intensive industries the inflationary effect of a 100% increase in fuel prices is bound to be modest.

Again, these even large tariff adjustments is moderate. State Revenues from Oil Product Sales in the Domestic Market and Exports 1.42 As required by law, revenues from oil product sales, once production, refining and marketing costs are deducted by Petroecuador, are distributed as follows: 10% flow into the Oil Investments Fund (Fondo de Inversiones Petroleras) and 90% to the General State Budget (PGE) and other participants. the form of a value-added tax and collects a so called \"single\" tax which, expressed in sucres and oil. 1.43 In 1991, the 90% share accounted for 21% of total oil revenues collected by the PGE. Bearing in mind that oil accounts for 46% of the PGE's overall 46.7% of the value of oil products the domestic market. the increase in earnings which resulted from the September 1992 increase in oil product prices on the domestic market, a sales forecast from the pricing study its DNH refining, prices. Revenues which would be generated by the 10% VAT were also added (Annex VI Tables 2-5). The price of crude the domestic market was adjusted to US$4.19 per barrel (from the previous level of US$2.32), and the refining margin was set at US$3.15. The price elasticity of demand was supposed to be Under these assumptions, the increase in revenues from domestic sales for the last four-month period of 1992 would total US$98.4 million, plus US$40.6 \"participants\" of oil earnings, a special tax accruing to the PGE could be levied on oil sales (with appropriate restrictions avoid increase that the pricing reforms may have (and might have had) on the budget and living conditions of low-income groups, up to a third of the public sector revenue gains could be earmarked to strenghten social support ease A description suggested mitigation policy. Briefly put, the first component of the proposal is to free the supply of kerex prior to the liberalization of the LPG and to establish to commit part of the extra revenues to selected social services and relief programs that effective are the beneficiaries (i.e., those focusing on nutrition, health, and human resource development). 2 ELIMINATION OF OIL AND POWER SUBSIDIES: IMPACTS ON FISCAL DEFICIT, MONEY SUPPLY AND INFLATION Introduction 2.1 This section presents the results of a simulation, for 1991, of the impact on the following variables of putting energy prices at their economic levels: The fiscal deficit, the need for monetary emission (to finance the deficit) the effect on inflation (its reduction) thanks to the lower fiscal deficit and reduced emission. 2.2 In brief, the results are that setting oil prices at opportunity costs and power Marginal of GDP).

The rate of inflation would not, however, fall to zero be sterilized counter a hyperinflation is comparatively easy, eliminating this residual, expectations-related, low inflation takes time. Even with this proviso, inflation would fall by 6 Kiguel, M. and N. Liviatan: Stopping Three Big Inflations (Argentina, Brazil and Peru); World Bank Working Paper No. WPS 999; year and this positive result would hold even if about a third of additional public revenues were used to mitigate/compensate low-income consumers (through public expenditures direct money subsidies) for the rise in the prices of energy and energy- intensive goods and services they consumed. 2.3 This section implies that a lot more could be done in favor of low-income, disadvantaged Ecuadoreans by selling or of productivity employment (the poor, as most poor Furthermore, having sensible economic policies would improve the prospects for economic growth, a benefit that goes beyond the simple expenditure of revenues (raised via taxation or the are the able defend themselves against inflation and to protect their incomes from the inflation tax. The data in this section are not exactly the same as in the rest of this report because of the need to use time series (monetary aggregates, fiscal and quasi fiscal deficits, ... etc.) so the size of revenues and subsidies may be different in some cases but this would not invalidate the general conclusion of this would reduce rather than increase it, as is the popular belief in Ecuador. A fuller technical treatment of the analysis on which this section is based is attached as Annex IV. 2.4 The economic measures proposed in this report are to essentially bring prices to their economic opportunity Long-Run Marginal Costs (LRMC). These measures have substantial economic and social impacts. An attempt was made, via a simple monetary model, to estimate the impact of increased public economy, due partly to the Central Bank's financing of a large share the fiscal deficit. The proposed pricing policy would eliminate the fiscal deficit monetary emission. These powerful results will only a program of measures designed to improve the allocation of resources, higher competitiveness productive Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 21 The results 2.5 The effects of increased energy prices on public revenues, fiscal deficit, money supply and inflation are summarized in Table 10. The results show that eliminating oil and power subsidies would definitely eliminate the fiscal deficit and in addition, generate a substantial fiscal surplus of 345 billion (based on the lower estimate). Monetary financing of the public deficit would no longer And, since the drastically reduced by about 60%. The remaining 40% of inflation is mainly the monetary consequence of the accumulation of international reserves. In the long term, however, the impact on inflation of this external origin deflationary goals achieved even if, in line with more recent pronouncements, some of the additional revenues were used to compensate the poor people who bear a large share of adjustment costs, i.e. even if the \"social debt\" were paid off. In fact, our calculations show that even if one third of additional revenues (192 billion sucres) were used to mitigate monetary emission and, thence, to dramatically reduce inflation. Thus, even in the case of sizeable social mitigation, the consolidated fiscal deficit would be more eliminated, from -230.8 billion sucres of 152.6 GDP). In this case, the absolute reduction in inflation, in the long term, is in the order of 95%, that is, virtually no inflation. Since, this price correction is the result an 86.4% reduction the related elasticity will be about 1.10 which is very much in line with the recent evolution of the Ecuadorean economy.

Adjustments in Fiscal Deficit 2.8 The fiscal deficit in Ecuador has two origins: the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) and the Central Bank. Current fiscal expenditures are mostly assumed by the NFPS, which is disproportionately large compared to the rest of the economy. In NFPS gross expenditures amounted to 38.1% of not all of the interest payments due, since about one-half of the interest payments due by the NFPS is serviced by the Central Bank. It is thus clear that, in the case of Ecuador, the relevant concept to measure the financial needs of the public sector is the consolidation of both the NFPS deficit and the net results of Central Bank operations or Quasi-Fiscal deficit. 2.9 This illustrates how tenuous the fiscal balance is when it depends on a single source of revenue for so much. Fiscal years 1989-1991 closed balanced on a cash basis (but 50% interests obligations are assumed by the but accrued on the external debt reached 21% of current expenditures in 1989 and 1990. The oil price windfall in 1990 contributed decisively to this outcome. 2.10 The Central Bank's quasi-fiscal deficit is mainly due to the extraneous fiscal role of the Bank, which is at the center of a complex maze of subsidies to and from the NFPS and the private sector. By far the most important is the assumption by the bank of the external debt of both the public and private sectors (39.7% of GDP in 1989). This large external indebtedness is mainly due the rescheduled public debt of the Treasury shifted onto the books of the Central Bank These external interests due amounted between consolidated fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic targets can be judged looking at the government budget constraint. This constraint says that the sum of the noninterest deficit and the interest bill on foreign and domestic debt is equal to the sum of financing from all sources. Fiscal deficits can be performed on a cash basis, the overall fiscal deficit was calculated both on a cash and accrual basis, to allow for estimation of external arrears. Between 1987 and 1991, some of the monetary consequences of fiscal deficits have been avoided arrears emission is on the supply side. From the Central Bank balance sheet we can derive that high powered money (H) is the sum of monetary financing (or domestic credit to the monetization of international reserves, asset accumulation (IR) and credit to the private sector (CPS) with other liabilities of the Central Bank. The external origin of monetary emission due to reserves accumulation or revaluation was 53% of total emmission in 1990 and 57.6% in 1991. In equation 1, only the money supply of domestic origin was considered: it demonstrates a strong elasticity of 1.15 in respect to changes in the fiscal deficit. C. Measurement of the deflationary 2.13 The 2 is on a pragmatic view of inflation from the perspectives of public finance (Phelps, 1973) and of monetary approach (J. J. Polak, 1977). In the short run, demand pressure or cost push factors such as changes in the wage or in the nominal exchange rate be important determinants of inflation. of sustained demand pressure, as fiscal implications of such inflation. The fiscal view of inflation points that short-term links between inflation and deficits are likely to be tenuous, but that any deficit coupled with a sustainable, constant ratio of debt to output implies a particular inflation rate. 2.14 There are three main sources of sustained inflation in Ecuador: the NFPS fiscal deficit, the quasi-fiscal deficit of the Central Bank and the monetization of international reserves. In the short run, the elimination of the NFPS fiscal deficit, by the way of eliminating subsidies, will reduce inflation by about 60%. The residual inflation is mainly due to the fiscal role of the Central Bank and its related policy of reserves monetization as an additional and less obvious way of financing the public deficit. However, in the long term, this residual source of inflation Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 25 would be offset as a rational consequence adjustments. Recent World Bank research, however, may suggest that this may take time and effort.7 2.15 The elimination of subsidies should help the Central (BCE) to recover its monetary policy function. In fact, a will provide the Government with the ability to debt. Public external debt could thus be retransferred to the Central Government. There is no reason why the BCE should continue to play a marked role in fiscal and financial intermediation. As the paper shows, the BCE would not need to run any deficit, if its only function were that of regulating monetary aggregates. In addition, the monetary of the accumulation of reserves due to real surpluses in the balance of payments. The monetization of reserves is the third cause of inflation. In fact, two factors can offset the monetary consequences of the of international reserves. First, the net accumulation of positive balances in the Central Bank by the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) will offset the balance of payments surpluses and the related increase in monetary reduced. As result, domestic savings will increase, leading to additional sterilization of powered money. Second, curing inflation will restore Ecuadorean competitiveness. The process of depreciation of the will stop, as well as the related revaluation (in sucres) of the stock international monetary Monetary consequences interval between and -100%, or more. 2.16 The price increases themselves will cause an increase in the costs of economic activities and summarizes these impacts. and impacts consumers and producers will adjust their costs and budgets. Furthermore, these cost increases are a once and for phenomenon and Impact on Costs and Prices Table prepared the Ecuadorean under-remunerated private deposits led the public sector to hold public debt, the Ecuadorean Government relied on money creation as the principal method of financing its deficit. This led to higher inflation rates. Within the controlled Ecuadorean economy, these of inflation resulted real interest rates. These in turn implied increasingly high returns in the informal economy which eventually became pervasive. All of this served to erode the tax base, increasing the deficit, leading to more money creation, initiating a vicious circle. The elimination of oil and power subsidies should break this vicious circle and restore a virtuous one. 2.18 Subsidies led external arrears since 1987), then onto the private domestic sector (when in 1988-89, the stabilization policy tried to cut private domestic and financial credit, to enable financing of the fiscal deficit) and last, minor one-- could lead to only way inflation was kept below explosive growth rates was due to the decline in the domestic demand for money. 2.19 Even the Central Bank could no longer sterilize money aggregates, since its monetary policy functions are hampered its role the Bank's external is At this stage. the burden of adiustment remains the domain of the public sector. It is demonstrated that the elimination of oil and power subsidies will dramatically eliminate the deficit and provide large fiscal surpluses. In the short run, inflation will be reduced by about 60%. In the long run it will definitely be cured. For every S/100 billion reduction in subsidy, inflation will to 23.3% in the long term. Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 27 2.20 The welfare of low-income households and poor people was the primary cause of concern of this study. The elimination of subsidies is implemented on a responsible basis: is one-third additional assigned to social spending. the removal of inflation will provide low-income households with a more stable framework in which they will be more productive, earn higher incomes, be ble to save (without having to pay the \"inflation tax\"), with better access to social services and to services needed to improve their human capital, thanks to additional resources (from higher energy prices) going to these activities. 3 main issues faced by Ecuador's electric power subsector. The first part of the section presents a diagnosis of the situation (technical and financial operational changes of and to improve both planning and selection of Overview Institutional and Regulatory Structure 3.2 Ecuador's integrated public utility, INECEL, responsible for bulk power generation and transmission and nineteen regional distribution companies that serve their customers with bulk purchases and autogenerated power. One of these distribution companies, EMELEC, serving Guayaquil, is owned by private foreign investors. The other 18, although organized as limited liability companies are owned by the State either through INECEL or regional for operation of these latter facilities. 3.3 The Basic Electrification Law of 1961 which defines generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization of power as a public service to be performed by a public entity, has led to the creation of INECEL, the Ecuadorean Electrification Institute. Placed under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) and, thus, operating as an executive branch of Government, in charge of planning, Power: Performance, 29 regulatory functions, including the approval of rates the distribution companies and the design of tariffs charged at the retail level (with the exception of EMELEC's tariffs which are handled by the MEM). A policies across different has not been operative to date. There is also a National Energy Institute (INE) which advises the MEM, but has no political leverage. INE should be reorganized and turned into the regulatory agency the sector lacks, or given the resources and the autonomy to perform its mandated role as an advisory body on energy policies. 3.4 Before the inflow of windfall profits that 1970s, INECEL's role had been restricted to that of a planning agency without financial resources. Thanks to its share in the country's oil revenues, INECEL graduated from a minor power company to a major public utility. 3.5 During the 1980s INECEL became generator, interconnected grid, and controlling, at least nominally, distribution companies by dint of being their majority shareholder. On the other hand, as a public utility, INECEL is subject to numerous legal, dependence budget allocations of the Central Government and the approval of its budget by the Congress, to public sector procurement procedures and civil service regulations that bog it down in its daily business. Moreover, INECEL is saddled with a Board of Directors intrude on of the Executive Directors, and have a strong bearing on the utility's overall performance. 3.6 INECEL's organizational structure was designed to be simple, but failed to work in practice. The weakness of administrative and operational direction in tandem with an ill- defined allocation of duties have fostered the growth of functional areas and an overlap of responsibilities. The general management is required to exercise its authority through a submanagerial unit that duplicates the decision-making process at the directly attached the general management did not really work. In addition, the management is stuck with a number of subordinate advisory and support units of which many are redundant. And the core operational areas, i.e. engineering and construction, system operation, and distribution/commercialization, footing such as electrification development. sector development. 3.7 Unlike INECEL, the nineteen distribution companies have a corporate structure, with the majority of the shares in 18 of them held by INECEL and the rest, by municipalities 30 Ecuador: Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution (only a tiny fraction of the shares is held by the public). The 19th, EMELEC (Electricity Company of Ecuador Inc.) serving the city of Guayaquil, remains the only company owned by private investors. Its concession, though, expired in 1985. The Government had made the decision to buy out the company, and according to an arbitration decision it is required to pay million assets and to assume EMELEC's debt to INECEL and Petroecuador. 3.8 While the distribution companies are not exposed to Central Government interference, they are controlled through result, the distribution companies' way of conducting business is driven not so much by corporate interests or system- wide considerations but by the political clout of local and regional pressure groups. 3.9 In brief, the governance structure of Ecuador's Power Sector is a public monopoly which clears (within the Board of Directors) and executes Central Government policies, has the operational responsibility for bulk power generation and transmission, and is supposed to regulate and control the performance of its regional subsidiaries, the distribution companies, and to a lesser extent, EMELEC. The structure does not lend itself to a be driven by sound corporate On the part of proliferation of the weakness of managerial leadership, and limited financial leeway go hand in hand with a lack of accountability and financial discipline. While being subject to INECEL's corporate and regulatory supervision, in practice, companies tend to self-regulate their activities in accordance with the political interests of their local/regional shareholders and clients.

By the end of 1991, INECEL's hydro power facilities (located at three sites) accounted for a nominal capacity of 1,300 MW, with the remainder of 376 MW provided by thermal plant. On the other hand, since the early 1970s little generating capacity has been added to the plant operated by distribution companies, probably reflecting the superior economics of the large hydro by INECEL. of the old plant became obsolete or inoperative. In 1991, the distribution companies' effective capacity was estimated at 353 MW, of which 271 MW were provided by thermal facilities, most of them owned the vicinity of 1,700 MW, with hydropower accounting for 1,100 MW (as of early 1992). The core infrastructure of the system also comprises 664 Km of 230 kV transmission lines forming a rectangular inner network from which 138 kV lines with a total length of 1,162 Km spread throughout the country. The distribution network comprises about 3,200 Km of 22-69 kV lines. Power: Performance, Recent Developments 3.11 During the 1980s, total electricity consumption (=sales) increased at an average annual rate of 6.1 %. Sales slowed down in 1983/84 and 1988/89. Thereafter, consumption growth resumed and rose at an annual rate exceeding 8%. By 1991, residential users accounted for total consumption, followed by (31%), \"others\" (15.5%) and the commercial sector (14.5%). 3.12 Between 1979 and 1989, the sector's gross generation rose from 2,718 GWh to 5,770 GWh, while peak load climbed from 600 MW to 1,093 MW. During the same period, thermal generation increased from 2,040 GWh in 1979 to 2,950 GWh in 1982 and then fell to 836 GWh in 1989. However, this trend came to a halt in 1990 when gross generation began to soar by almost 10% a year. As gross generation jumped from 5,770 GWh in 1989 to 6,989 GWh in 1991, with peak load reaching the level of 1,246 MW, available hydropower capacity which at the end of 1991 expected to provide an annual average of about 6,500 GWh failed to match either the growth or load profile of demand. As a consequence, the system had to thermal have been mothballed by 1991. Indeed, between 1989 and 1991 thermal generation rose from 836 GWh to 1,919 GWh, with its share Since hydro capacity is not likely to come on stream before 1995 and given the fact that the installed plant, plagued unreliable backup capacity meeting incremental the system face severe capacity and energy constraints in the immediate future. Another factor contributing to the reliability problems is the transmission network. Its current design is not suited to safely match demand when thermal plants make up for a large share in generation. (There is also no reactive power control). The vulnerability of the sector became manifest in early 1992 when the drought considerably reduced the of hydroreservoirs, electricity supply which were exacerbated by failures in the transmission system. Markets 3.14 At the end of 1991, the nineteen distribution companies served a total of 1.5 million customers. Residential Users account for 86% of the connections and have a 38% share in total electricity consumption. On the other hand, with 13% of the connections, commercial and industrial clients account for 45% of total consumption. Almost 90% of the customers are located in urban areas. The major load centers are in Guayaquil with 33% of the system's noncoincident peak demand, and Quito which contributes 25% to the system peak. Likewise, 61 % of total electricity consumption can be ascribed to the cities of Guayaquil and Quito. Ten distribution companies have a market share of less than 2% each. Average monthly during season shows reverse It highest in the dry season and lowest from July to October. The daily peak between 7 and 10pm. The residential users' peak responsibility is 100%, while industrial customers account for 78%, and commercial users for 70% of the daily peak. 3.16 In 1991, bulk power transactions amounted to 81% of the electricity generated (net) by the sector. Only 0.4% of the sector's bulk power sales came from distribution companies (equivalent to about 2% of their net generation); the remainder was provided by INECEL. Almost 99% companies; GWh) was exported to Colombia (from EMELNORTE), and the balance of about 0.8% was not accounted for in INECEL's records. In any case, INECEL did not buy from distribution companies, and the trade among distribution companies was minuscule. Sector Performance 3.17 During the 1980s, INECEL's ambitious investment program was financed mainly by earmarked and, to a foreign borrowing. The sector itself was unable to contribute to the financing of the expansion program. Consequently, when the country's oil revenues became less plentiful, the encountered leading to a delay in planned investments in power generation and transmission. INECEL not only experienced rising deficits, but was left with having to service a total debt of about US$ 1.1 billion by 1992 (which has been assumed by the Central Government). Apart from INECEL's weakness and continue to be (i) its inability to raise and keep tariffs at a level compatible with cost recovery (although, with the measures applied on September 4, 1992, an important step was taken toward a more logical tariff-setting policy), and (ii) the distribution companies' unwillingness to pay their bills. As the latter (and more so Government institutions) notoriously fall behind on payments due to INECEL and on average fulfill only 50% of their may have pleased the distribution companies, but entailed little financial relief for INECEL. 3.18 By international standards, INECEL and its subsidiaries are overstaffed. The sector employs about 10,200 persons. With 521 kWh a year, the volume of sales per employee is significantly lower than in comparable countries. Too much decision power vested in INECEL's Board diverse of the appointees representing INECEL in the Board of distribution companies are not overly interested in the performance and efficiency of the companies. Within INECEL's administration, a major shortcoming has been that planning, which given a are costly, particularly for industrial users. There is no economic dispatch, and the central dispatch facilities which are currently being installed will do little to improve the situation as long as shortages at the generation end as well as reliability constraints faced by 3.20 Another problem for the power sector, negatively influencing overall performance, is the high level of transmission and distribution losses. Total losses are on the order of 24% of net power generation (4% in transmission and 20% in distribution, of which the largest share, possible around 13%, results from developed countries, distribution losses range from 4% to 5% so that there is great potential to reduce these losses in Ecuador. ESMAP, with the collaboration of the Ecuadorean power sector (and with cofinancing from Belgium and Switzerland) Fomento) loan/grant of million, with Belgian begin the recommended investments. Sector Expansion Program 3.21 A major dilemma of Ecuador's power sector is that while the implementation of a number of expansion projects is is 575 MW, was supposed to be operative at the end of the 1980s, but came on stream only in November 1991. The construction works of the multi- purpose project, Daule Peripa which were planned to start in 1988 are still not complete. As a consequence, the 130 MW of the hydro component are not likely to be available before 1997. A second 230 kV transmission line from Paute to Guayaquil was planned and should have been completed at the same time as Paute C but has still not been built. This is why generation at Paute is limited to 820 MW out of an installed capacity of 1075 MW. A project aimed at the rehabilitation of 49 thermal plants that are owned by distribution companies and could provide a total of 129 MW, is being delayed because of a lack of finance. Finally, the MW) located upstream of reported to the design stage since 1987. The project would help stem the of the Amaluza increase the Paute plant's storage capacity which currently is limited to five of operation. However, conclusive studies on the technical feasibility and project do yet. Finally, since the Paute watershed accounts for about 90% the capacity, risk of drought-induced shortages could become even greater than it is today. 3.22 The sector total investments scheduled for the 1990s amount to about US$2.9 Also, INECEL reckons that, at the turn of the century, an additional one million customers will be connected to the grid. 34 Ecuador: Energy Subsidies Substitution and resulting backlog of investment activities, none of the proposed projects is likely to materialize on time. For that reason the recently completed tariff study has revised INECEL's master plan for The least-cost expansion plan favored by the study begins in 1997 and calls for the installation of a gas turbine (85 MW) in October 1997, the completion of San Francisco (210 MW hydro) in November 1997, and the comnmissioning of Chespi (167 MW hydro) in November 2,000, assuming that until 1997 demand can be met with the existing plant plus the capacity additions scheduled for the period 1992-1996. It seems, though, that the picture drawn by the study is still optimistic. The revised capacity expansion strategy is most likely to be thwarted by financial realities. And if electricity demand continues to grow at the rates observed in the years, shortages will become pervasive in the short-to-medium 1992 presidential period). tariffs subject to the they provide the sector with an adequate rate of return on investment. In practice, though, tariffs are fixed by the Board on political grounds with little regard to economic considerations. Based on the fallacy that as a public service the provision of electricity can defy economic reasoning, pricing of electricity has become a political matter. The policy imperative has been to serve as many consumers as possible with as much electricity as is available, without letting them know what costs they incur. Things went well as long as the Central Government was able to invest huge amounts in a small, but rapidly growing sector run by a public utility the in tariffs took place on September 4, 1992, together with an increase in domestic oil prices and those of other publicly-supplied goods and services. The tariff increase of September however, again at 200 kWh. This freeze applies to the first 200 kWh consumption residential increase the average tariff. increase is more fully described in the table below, as well as the marginal average cost per consumer class. Power: Performance, Recent Developments 35 Table Charge 3.25 During between S/34 and S/51 per kWh (in prices of 1991), in spite of four major attempts INECEL made to raise and keep tariffs at a level. The next to last significant rate increase took place in 1989 when the price for bulk supplies doubled and retail tariffs on average rose by 50%. The increase was highest for industrial customers both wholesale and retail transactions were increased by 3% a month (about 40 % a year), with the exception of the first 200 kWh/month of consumption, which face automatic rate the impact of the measures gradually lost momentum as inflation continued to eat up the adjustments in nominal tariffs. Moreover, since the increases in residential lagged between residential and nonresidential rates became larger. Between 1988 and 1991 the ratio of average residential to average industrial rates fell from 0.8 to 0.5 (while costs of service are usually in the reverse ratio) but in September, 1992, this ratio rose to 0.74. 36 Ecuador: capacity and an charge. also a on capacity drawn in rates apply uniformly to all distribution companies, a discriminatory scheme of energy discounts has the effect that the companies' average costs electricity can vary The rationale for the discounts is to (cross) subsidize companies that are placed at a disadvantage in terms location, the the at the subtransmission level (138 kV) amounted to S/2,980/kW/month, while energy was sold at an average of s/56/kWh. The load factor relevant to the transmission level under consideration is about 0.54. Hence, the distribution companies on average s/32.16/kWh (0.021 comparison, INECEL's tariff study of March '92 estimates that the average costs of bulk power supplied US$/kWh rate September 1992, the bulk charges were S/127,3/kwh rate of 3.27 The tariffs charged at the retail level vary by customer class. Residential consumers pay a fixed charge up to 20 kWh/month, subject a demand charge and average, equivalent US$0.0397/kWh of an increasing block schedule, with a flat rate for a consumption level of 20 kWh/month or less. A similar scheme applies to July water pumping, large such as the refineries. Also, in some cities, notably the monthly electricity bill presented to final consumers often includes a separate fixed charge for fire protection services and a garbage removal fee are assessed as a percentage consumers totalled US$223.4 million (nearly 2% of GDP of 1991). In September 1992, after the increase in tariffs, the total subsidy was cut to about U$104.8 (less than 1% of GDP) or may be a little bit less, as consumers, especially those who are no longer subsidized to their consumption. In fact, using no to covering part of the subsidy accruing enterprise (handicrafts) to electricity Under tariff regime to the costs incurred by INECEL). On the other hand, since the distribution companies buy electricity at US$0.021/kWh or less and on average sell for US$0.036/kWh, their margin is in the vicinity of Depending US$0.005 and US$0.020/kWh. Hence, the distribution sector as a whole does not seem to experience major financial difficulties (even if the companies were to pay INECEL promptly, which they don't). The lion's with the Government acting as the financier of last resort. The situation since September 3, 1992, has improved considerably. the average tariff for the distribution companies will be around US$0.0361 1/kWh, compared to US$0.0653 which is the estimated benefitted residential customers. If subsidies are defined as direct economic costs to the power sector that customers do not pay, then the households connected to the grid received in July 1992 a total subsidy of US$10.7 million. On an annual basis, this amounts to US$128 million. The subsidy per kWh/month These account for 58% of total 91% of the total number of consumers, receiving 64% of the total subsidies to the residential sector. this situation has changed to the residential sector and those consuming between 1000 and 1500 kwh/month are subsidized by US$24 instead of US$91 as for 3.8% of the total subsidy for the residential sector. 3.31 Industry was the second largest recipient of subsidies supported by the tariff system. In July 1992, it received about US$3.4 million, which works out at US$41.2 million a year. Next is the commercial sector which accounts for US$26.7 million a year, followed by public lighting and water lifting with an annual subsidy of US$12.4 million and US$6.5 million respectively. The annual take of Government institutions is worth US$6.3 million, and small manufacturers receive US$2.1 million a year (all figures are extrapolated July 1992 estimates). This situation has changed since September 3, 1992, as industry no longer receives a subsidy. This sector contributes to financing regime by the July regime. The economic costs of the subsidies are likely to be higher due to deadweight losses (e.g. the adverse impact that the financial drain has on sector operation and development) that the above figure does not take into account. In particular, government transfers to the sector do not made up for the financial losses entailed by the subsidies. At any rate, the the subsidies as well as its distortionary impacts, place a burden on the power sector and the economy at large that is neither Total Share in Subsidiary Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Total cons (UScents/kWh) (%) Sept 92 July Sept 92 10685 8805 43.1 Commercial without DC 4.3 0.3 9.1 1.5 1702 130 9.1 Commercial with DC 1.4 -0.9 2.8 -3.0 524 -263 6.6 Handicraft 5.3 1.7 0.9 0.6 174 56 0.1 2.3 -0.0 18.4 -0.6 3433 -0.8 169 -66 1.0 Govt.

Economic growth and social progress will call for additional electricity supplies, improved services, the expansion of service areas, and cost-efficient utility performance. The sector, however, needs are and within the finance needed to sustain expand the sector's is hostage to an ineffective redistribution policy that has never been (costly) and allocative (regressive) implications. And corporate responsibility, true 40 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution that did not really guide the behavior of sector institutions. As a result of these shortcomings, investments in essential infrastructure are lagging behind the growth of demand, service quality is deteriorating, and the sector has neither the incentives the resources to redress the that the sector, redefine its responsibilities, and establish a revised system of regulatory control and supervision. The key ingredients of the reform package will be a new tariff policy and a institutional framework. Policy While electricity appears to good, it in fact has multiple dimensions, depending on where, when, and how it is generated or used. For that reason, pricing of electricity becomes a complicated task. In particular, the cost of generating a kWh and the value it has to a consumer may vary during the day, month, or year. Moreover, since general cannot be stored or retraded, generating capacity must be sized to meet peak demand, even though the peak may last only a short period of time. While the load (level of demand) changes over time, generating plants differ in On economic grounds, it is therefore expedient to the generating facilities costs, minimum costs Also, the costs of a kWh vary with the level of reliability at which it is supplied. The higher the level of reliability, the more supply. losses, depending on the technical characteristics of the transmission and distribution lines, the transport distance, and the flows through the lines. As is argued below, an optimal to a number of objectives, the most common ones are: (a) Economic efficiency (b) Equity (c) Cost recovery (d) Transparency and ease implementation. A brief summary of this topic is given here, with a fuller, more rigorous treatment given in Annex 1. Economic efficiency is required theory must clear the market at for every location. Such supplying electricity, taking into account the load to be met, the merit order dispatch, transmission losses, and the design limits of the system. Stated differently, they inform consumers the different their demand. Moreover, since efficient prices have to clear the market, they are just equal to what consumers are willing to pay for being supplied with electricity. 3.38 In addition, efficient prices are the (or suppliers) no efficient prices may the to revenue and required to raise funds from non-government sources or, as the case may be, attract private investors whenever this is needed or desirable. Finally, electricity prices that support commercial goals, but are not fully congruent with the ideal of economic efficiency, tend to outperform tariff systems that (at best) to be efficient, yet provide to operate in an efficient way. So convincing is the case that can be made for SRMC-pricing on theoretical grounds, so difficult is its implementation in So in most circumstances, particularly when demand and supply are not pursuit of a perfectly efficient pricing electricity between the requirements of economic efficiency and the actual capabilities to meet these requirements. As has been outlined before, there are a number of constraints and difficulties beset should structured to inform users about costs they impose on the system. prices should be viable, allow the recover its costs. Third, the tariff system should be compatible with commercial goals. In particular, if the power sector has to strive for scarce financial resources, the regulatory framework attributable to the consecutive services (generation, transmission, etc), that the sector performs in supplying its customers. Fifth, says it services in terms of price, customers should be given the opportunity Ecuador: Energy Pricing, 3.40 term \"unbundling Ecuador's electricity sector, unbundling is an issue relevant to the division of labor between power generation, transmission, and distribution. Since services and costs vary across the country's franchised discretion to custom-tailor their tariffs system: One for bulk power transactions between the generation and transmission complex and its wholesale customers (the distribution companies and, as the case may be, large industrial users), and one that applies to the retail level and reflects the different infrastructural and economic characteristics of the distribution areas. Once a coherent system of tariffs for bulk supplies is in place (differentiated by load, voltage level, and location), the distribution companies should be held responsible for selecting a mix of bulk and own generation that serves their customers at least cost. Retail tariffs that take of regional differences may appear to be discriminatory. However, this will not be the case as long as tariff differentials are a mere response to 1992. Its implementation (which this report strongly endorses) could make an important contribution to restoring the financial health of the sector and enhancing the incentive framework of its operators and customers. The study is based and profile of loads. It calls for an increase in the level and a change in the structure and number of rates applying to for line losses and the costs of transmission and distribution services. Compared to the rates which were in place in july 1992, the new system would have increased average tariffs by USc3.0/kWh for residential evaluation the completed Tariff study and of its implementation and Annex III presents a method to more exactly calculate average incremental generating costs (when the additional factors exerting a negative impact on the efficiency, management and financial performance of the electric power activity have been specially noticed. Most of these factors are due to an inadequate and obsolete legal framework and regulatory setup. Many Power: Performance, Recent Developments 43 have been analyzed in the earlier part of this section. This second part of the section on electric power will analyze the main institutional issues and make very general recommendations on how fact INECEL's Board of representatives). INECEL's management general manager is replaced after each presidential election at times, even Likewise, managerial positions (executive director) are assigned to persons outside the institution, that is, not by internal promotion which may imply a lack of \"esprit de corps\" in the management team's group certain difficult decisions are trapsferred to President of the Republic. This occurs in institutional structure matters, in the case of characteristic of public bodies apply to INECEL. as in most countries, too numerous, long, tedious and complex and totally unadapted to the operation of companies or institutions active in commercial and competitive industrial markets. For example, expenditures exceeding US$40,000 must be approved by Directors. The chain of administrative procedures characteristic of all public entities, such as that of the Procurator's office and the Comptroller's office apply to INECEL. As the electric power industry certainly plays an essential strategic role within a country's economic and social development it must, therefore, implement missions general interest. Pursuing these general is perfectly compatible with a dynamic and efficient company management. Whatever INECEL's status, (i.e. private or public) it would be advisable to distinguish between the procedures applicable to public entities evolving within an industrial and commercial market (such as the electric power companies) and those which are not (for example, hospitals or ministries). Insufficient tariffs 3.45 aim of a more in depth study which has just been completed and is commented on in more detail in the preceding section. Suffice it to say, insofar it concerns this section, that tariffs in force during August 1992 did not reflect the costs of electric power generation, transmission and distribution. This situation stems from the Government's permanent refusal tariffs to cover costs (direct the overall economy of the country, for INECEL and for the distribution companies. With the tariff increase its operating activities of generation, transmission, distribution and marketing (through 18 private limited liability distribution companies of which INECEL is the main shareholder), and EMELEC which is a privately owned distribution company, INECEL performs a series of other activities in keeping with the Basic Electrification Law (Ley Basica de Electrificaci6n), which range from the development of rural electrification, to the construction and engineering of the installations of the National Interconnected Grid, as well as the purchase of materials and spare parts for the distribution companies (E.E.). In addition, by order of the same Basic Electrification Law, INECEL assumes the dual role as approving the tariffs to be applied by distribution companies. This duality does not constitute a sound management policy in general, nor in this specific situation. The systematic blockage of incomplete payment for the power sold by INECEL to the distribution companies, even though INECEL is their majority shareholder. activities within INECEL is counterproductive for the electric power subsector as a whole, as well as for power users. Powerful impact of trade low efficiency the Regardless of the classic arguments, the problem of trade union intervention in management, the impossibility of firing labor, overstaffing and low productivity are, among others, factors must of these organizations should be correctly appreciated so that they may be focussed on within the framework of the restructuring measures that need to be implemented. In addition to the many factors leading to inefficient sector management mentioned above, The Political Constitution of the Republic, the Basic Electrification Law, and the Organic Law of Financial Management and Control (Ley Orgdnica de Administraci6n Financiera y Control -LOAFYC) form a very rigid framework that establishes the supply of electric power as a private function of the State, conducted through INECEL. However, INECEL is a public institution subject to regulations and controls that impede it from carrying out the tasks entrusted to it. The power conceded to INECEL to create private limited companies has not this Power: Performance, Recent Developments 45 basic issue because these limited companies (18 out of the 19 distribution companies) are created by the public sector (virtually 100% government-owned) and are therefore subject to the monitoring and control system applicable to public institutions (that is, LOAFYC), any way. Basic Ideas on Restructuring 3.49 This section aims to formulate ideas that proposals on how to restructure the institutional and regulatory system within which the Ecuadorean electric power sector evolves. Due to the short time available and the fact that a complete restructuring study is about to be started under a World Bank funded project, only a few comments are presented on the nature of essential changes the regulatory framework, growth of competition, improvement of quality of service relative autonomy of the distribution companies. Likewise, legislative changes must be made to enable any company or private individual to perform any of the electric power activities currently companies. INECEL's operational activities (essentially power generation and transmission) must be removed from what is a public institute dependent on the Ministry of Energy and Mines. INECEL must be subjected to the discipline of the market whether it becomes one or several private company(ies) or one or several mixed public/private company(ies), depending on the speed of its transfer from public to private ownership and according to the degree of privatization and decentralization wished to be achieved. The electric power industry, an industry like any other 3.51 Regardless of the degree of privatization, the sector's managerial or component must its entirety, under management rules identical to those of classic private commercial or industrial companies (normal corporate rules) operating in market economies. Within this context, contracts between sector companies must be controlled by private law, not public law, as must the relationship between all types of suppliers (equipment goods, investments or repairs, and services). Relationship between the electric power distribution companies (EE) and INECEL 3.52 The relationship between the electric power distribution companies (except EMELEC) and their major shareholder, INECEL, is not as clear as it should be between a shareholder and the private limited company in which it holds shares (the electric power companies are legally private, limited companies). Moreover, as INECEL has neither managed to consolidate its position as majority shareholder nor its political capacity to control the electric power companies, it has tried to do this by using managerial and bureaucratic Interfuel Substitution the permanent financial dependency of the electric power companies on INECEL forces them to accept. This has resulted in the creation of huge obstacles to the efficient management of the distribution companies. Although relations between the distribution companies, INECEL as power supplier and INECEL as shareholder, are perfectly compatible under a normal private company system, the aforementioned situation necessitates the complete separation of the relationship between distribution company and shareholder, and between distribution company and the agency supplying bulk power. Reciprocal debts between INECEL and the 3.53 Often, when INECEL implements work or sees that work is carried out for the distribution companies, the value of the work undertaken is often presented as a capital contribution from INECEL to the distribution companies (since INECEL is usually unable to obtain cash payment for this work). INECEL may also request the distribution companies to undertake work for it or they may make purchases for INECEL. Although, the distribution companies pay the contractor directly they are often not reimbursed by INECEL and they compensate, by not paying INECEL for all their power purchases. These \"self-compensations\" and do reciprocal debts and itself and the distribution companies. document should detail the obligations the expenditures. Investments of the Distribution companies 3.54 The distribution companies must be able to implement thermal and hydro generation facilities within their own areas and for their own needs. The tariff-setting formula for distribution companies. Up until now, however, distribution company investments have been decided by respective Boards of without considering any analytical or economic criteria. Opening up the distribution companies to other shareholders 3.55 The distribution companies should be able to count on industrial clients as shareholders (for example, the Chamber of Industry), so that they are involved in financing new generation units, rehabilitating current power stations or other investments. In addition, the current system of small, private companies (private limited companies) should be maintained because their privatization could be relatively of shares. Moreover, tariffs should differ according to distribution area so technical, economic and financial conditions (for example, quality of service, geographic dispersion, structure of client) of each one of the 19 distribution companies can be taken into account. This would enable the distribution companies to offer their clients a mixture of autogenerated power 47 INECEL's on generation and activities The preceding state that INECEL performs many activities which unnecessarily complicate management of the Institute and corner all the financial means available. For this reason, INECEL should focus on the generation and transmission of electric power. This focus will also facilitate the privatization process. In addition, Independently should be by by the regulator (for example, avoided cost). center must be created to coordinate the system's integral operation and all the units belonging to the different operators (generation, distribution company and independent producers). Institutional reforms 3.57 the detailed information is found in the reports prepared as background to this study). Several areas have also been mentioned where substantial changes need to be made. In fact, the aforementioned ideas for reform make up a general framework, which is common to many countries, and which Ecuador will need to follow if restructuring the electric power sector is to be considered seriously. This general framework for evolution from a totally state-owned sector (with its numerous failings as mentioned dynamic (technically and or private electric power sector requires moving through the following stages, a. Legislative changes to abolish the State monopoly (which is presently complete in Ecuador) and to specify the basic rules of the electric power industry, separating it from the regulatory system (existing or about to be created); b. The creation of a regulatory agency whose characteristics and attributes are defined in the basic electrification the of cost-based tariffs regulation). This regulator could be in charge of the whole energy sector (electricity, oil and other sources); c. Reorganization and restructuring, which often includes total or partial privatization state electric power entities (companies or pseudo-companies). Several issues which must be borne in mind when starting on the road to reforms, in keeping with the general framework described here, in the following paragraph. Specific well sequence of actions and mechanisms to be used, will be defined in a more detailed study which is about to be started with funds provided through an ongoing of the reform proposals for the entire electric power sector. This section lists a number of general principles regarding the status and prerogatives of the regulatory agency. These principles need to be adjusted to the specific prevailing condition of the power industry before being finalized in detail and implemented. While there is no universal truth in these matters, the general principles mentioned below have been found to have general applicability and they are suggested by the Bank to its member countries in a recently published Policy Paper on from INECEL's the regulator). \"Independent\" means that the regulator cannot be part of or depend on the Ministry of Energy and Mines or any other governmental office of that same level. \"Highly competent\" implies that the regulator's personnel must be of and financial qualifications, and offer skills or qualification will credibility, completely conduct and/or supervise studies necessary for the overall discharging of responsibilities. Responsibility for the daily running of this regulatory agency could be entrusted to a high-ranking official who would try to obtain the greatest possible efficiency, be as independent as possible from political pressures and have rapid access to the highest levels of the State (either the Presidency or the Council of Ministers). Moreover, the its own independent the regulator's operating expenses are covered. To dynamic agency, the total number of personnel should be limited by law. Description of the regulator's main duties or prerogatives 3.60 The main maintain appropriate to enable the power activities to in parts (see Annex I on tariff setting), which could potentially be managed by different public and/or private companies (that is, which enable an \"unbundling\" of services). For example, this regulatory agency could have had performed a tariff study such as the one recently completed, and could now be in charge of putting it into practice. b. To promote the entry of private capital into all areas of the electric power industry and to establish a contractual framework to enable the commercial interchange of electric power between all the companies (public and/or private), throughout all phases of the electric power industry, Developments 49 c To direct the indicative planning of generation and transmission projects of national importance (to plan, but to be willing to consider the alternatives proposed by the companies). d. To advise, counsel and explain the basic issues and options of Small Hydropower and the Directorate of Distribution and Marketing (DISCOM). 3.61 This first Directorate has a large staff (on the order of 700 persons). The current organization needs to be flexible because most construction workers are unemployed due to a lack of financial resources (for building new installations). In 1980, demand was forecast to increase by 10% and 6%, the personnel hired implement needed projects are still INECEL. A reduction in force is unavoidable although a basic capacity must be maintained for the eventual resumption of projects. Redundancies could also occur in other areas INECEL, Small small-scale studies and projects (and employs 37 persons), and the Directorate of Distribution and Marketing (DISCOM, which employs 260 persons) which manages relations with the electric power companies in which INECEL is a shareholder, a relationship which would tend to disappear with the independence of electric power companies. While this is mentioned here under \"reforms\" it is really merely a which INECEL Trade As the importance of the unions is restructuring measures, selecting with whom when hold should be decided carefully. As demonstrated by recent experience Bolivia, where the public sector union's considerable influence almost made the country ungovernable, sector restructuring has to involve discussion with the trade unions and a reduction in intervention in management. Conclusions soon as The main points of the restructuring of the Ecuadorean electric 50 Ecuador: Energy Interfuel reforms are highly and experienced regulatory agency. b. Restructuring and eventual privatization of the electric power industry, that is, the transformation of INECEL and the electric power companies into normal, ordinary industrial companies (whether private, public or mixed). c. The specific problem of INECEL's engineering and construction department (and, to extent, the Small Hydro reforms mentioned in this study are: a. that there is very low motivation and productivity throughout the system; b. that the sector's financial deterioration persists; c. and that the current political for the introduction and political consensus on the urgency of these reforms has to be forged and the way of carrying them out, transparent and honorable, must be agreed. The necessary a number of issues in the hydrocarbons Since this study mainly a short/medium term pricing and strategy study, coverage of the hydrocarbons subsector is not complete. For example, while some aspects of upstream legislation (exploration and production) are mentioned, they are not analyzed in depth. On the other hand, the marketing of domestic kerosene (kerex) is dealt with in detail (a study of just this matter is attached as Annex V). The largest investment being considered, enhanced recovery in the Petroamazonas fields under be downstream operations are reviewed critically and most are found to be uneconomic, and more importantly, not needed at this stage. This will of (domestic suggestions for improving it; -deregulation/privatization of -reserves 4.2 In the lion's of the investments needed Petroproducci6n and Petroamazonas should only invest in discovered fields in their production areas, or near them. Also, Petroecuador should open to foreign companies the exploration of areas that have a good potential, which it has reserved to itself. These areas present good prospectivity of finding light crudes which are needed to move the heavier ones. 4.3 If the foreign private companies start producing the crude (heavy) from their recently discovered B/D (based on 320,000 B/D in mid 1992). This will require an investment of about US$750 million by these companies over the next 2-3 years. Optimistic forecasts 52 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution private oil companies and Petroecuador suggest that an output of 400,000 B/D may be attainable in 1996 or 97. 4.4 To encourage foreign investments in exploration and production, it should be taken into account that the fifth round of exploration (which discovered the heavy crudes that to be produced), suffered some setbacks: -The crude what expected. -The quality of the expected (15-21\u00b0 API rather than 290 API, like the Oriente cause higher costs in exploration and production (as well as in processing and utilization). This means that the profitability of the companies is lower than was expected and that maybe the government would need to help the companies (the \"R\" factor is now unrealistic) provided it remains economic to exploit these heavy crudes. Since the economics of these discoveries are marginal, the narrow margin must be split carefully between the state and the oil companies otherwise one of the parties may end up with a loss-making situation (which would not be sustainable). While companies naturally take this into account when they negotiate contracts, in case there were several factors which gave unfavorable outcomes and so, the economics of these discoveries are marginal. Also, the contractual arrangements (contrato de prestaci6n de servicios) are not attractive enough and complicate the relationship between the companies, Petroecuador and the State and cause double taxation in some cases. This report strongly recommends the different Agreements, concessions or direct negotiations with oil companies. This will require legal changes but not constitutional ones (because the crude can still be owned by the State). 4.5 As for investments, the analysis of several recent studies suggests that neither big upstream nor downstream projects that are being discussed are really justified. The primary and secondary recovery methods currently being used in the Shushufindi and Sasha fields are the most appropriate and show a very good recovery of the crude petroleum in situ. Therefore, a decision on whether to move to tertiary (or enhanced) is no longer so urgent. In any case, the traditional exploration methods are still, for now, the most economic way of adding to reserves (rather than tertiary or enhanced recovery). 4.6 As for refining, present capacity could be sufficient (even more so if better price policies give greater incentive to conservation) until the end of the century (with small investments in Esmeraldas). It is too early to talk about a new refinery for heavy crudes (whose production has not started yet) and whose production by the end of the century might only reach 40,000 B/D. Also, nothing at present suggests that domestic refining of this crude will be the best option (in, say, 1998). The actual production of Oriente crude could stabilize and it will continue Hydrocarbons 53 to exceed the intemal needs of for quite some time. In addition, recent studies made for the processing of heavy crudes have been carried out by institutions interested in the execution of the projects being studied (and this creates a of refineries on the Peninsula and consolidating all refining at Esmeraldas. 4.7 Small investments to add to the capacity of the transecuadorean pipeline could be justified, but after having studied the possibility of using the existing pipeline spur to Colombia. The expansion of the terminal in Balao to receive bigger carriers (Very Large Crude Carriers - to export crude to the Far East could also be justified. This investment could become less urgent if Ecuador were to recover nearby markets, like Peru and Chile who need to import Oriente crude to optimize refinery runs (Peru) or short of needs (Chile). Price Policies 4.8 Ecuador is one of the will allow more rational use of the resource; give incentive to conservation; eliminate a good part of the contraband trade and allow the State to substantially reduce the fiscal deficit and the concomitant monetary emission which causes the stubborn inflation addition, price policy would allow an increase in public in the (as compensation to poor households for the higher prices and tariffs for goods and services supplied 4.9 Kerosene small quantities (whereas LPG is \"lumpy\"), it is should the onlv socially important fuel. However, its price should never have fallen to the ridiculous level of S/60/gallon (US$0.04/gallon in mid 1992). In the price structure that is to be established, it should not be too cheap in relation to diesel and it should be sold freely to avoid the monopolization of which it is the object right now and which is resulting in final prices in excess of ex-refinery (for example, from S/60 to S/900- 1000 per gallon) could mean little or no increase to the final consumer, provided that the product is sold freely. Its free marketing (at a higher price) through gasoline service stations have higher revenues and consumers, a better access to the product. The price of kerosene should be brought close to its economic price (around S/1142 per gallon) over a short period of, say, one year. For LPG, its domestic price could also be brought to its economic price (S/750/Kg) in three gallon. This was before the Sept. 92 price increase. Since then, final prices rose to about S/1300/gallon. See background paper on the marketing and pricing of kerosene prepared for this study and attached from in Sept. '92); -Second: from S/200 to S/500 per to S/750, over a 6-8 month period. 4.10 The price of that the price of the crude for domestic refining were increased to its economic price As computed available information, the value resulting latter option is inferior to CIF value of the products because of two reasons: i) refining cost are underestimated and, ii) the setting of the price of crude at its FOB value for domestic refining 33.8 million gallons in 1991, is a result of both the restricted marketing system itself and persistent low prices for liquefied petroleum gas, a fuel that, in addition, is more consumer-friendly. On the grounds that kerex is a fuel getting only a share of this subsidy. The current marketing system involves distribution of kerex directly to communities and public health organization, etc., by Petroecuador. In the cities, kerex is sold to the final consumer in traditional markets (ferias libres) and at specific outlets. 4.12 Rationing at the distribution outlets, however, is widespread and in some cases, the sale of kerex is limited to a maximum of two gallons per person. Because of this rationing, there are long lines of organized groups involving the whole family, including children, who generally buy the product mainly for resale. Final prices (before S/650 gallon even more, depending on the remoteness and isolation of the place. In rural and marginal areas this product is even traded in bottles, at prices far higher, since the reference price (that of diesel 1 for sale to industry) amounts to S/1460 per gallon since September, instead of S/630. September 92 price increase has widened differential between the two the incentive divert kerex. of higher than the price of kerex, even before September a black market had developed supplying industry, small-scale dishing and other productive activities with at a price substantially lower than that of diesel 1 (or diesel 2). evidence Quito's traditional markets has situation. example, of available these is sold to the intended beneficiaries, to industrial users (if all of it had gone to household use) and the remainder is diverted and sold to substitute Petroecuador's sales and the number of households consuming this fuel, it was found that only 9% of sales can be justified as residential Hydrocarbons 55 consumption. Although the number of households consuming the product in 1990 amounted to only 13% of that of 1982, consumption in 1990 was 40% of that of 1982. In 1990, average kerex consumption amounted to 90 gallons per month per household, is exaggerated compared to an estimated average real consumption of no more than 10 gallons per month per is therefore that of the subsidies are generally not low-income consumers but the middlemen, as well as and LPG, are currently being subsidized pricing policy, would reserve kerex to LPG, which should reach its economic value in the short run. Moreover, the margin between the price of kerex and diesel 1 needs to be reduced. The new kerex price could be based on the average of what be decontrolled that it can be distributed again from service stations, with more outlets in marginal areas of cities and rural areas, to discourage monopolization and enable the product to reach final consumers at the lowest possible cost. In rural areas, where LPG has not fully penetrated, the possibility of broadening the marketing of kerex is quite good, in order to substitute grasses, straw and fuelwood, reduce ecological damage and lower the time cost of gathering traditional fuels. Similarly, in many suburban areas with low considered a Impact 4.15 A element this study is its attempt to measure the impact of the use of energy on low-income households. A survey was carried out (August-December 1992) about the use of energy in poor urban and rural households. The survey also attempts to investigate consumer attitudes in relation to different of energy and their prices. The survey would also try to measure the consumption of goods and services with a high energy content (such as transport) and the impact of higher prices budgets. are also being investigated as well as the delivery and support system that serve them. The idea is that a part (say, a third) of the additional public revenues could be spent on social programs that directly support the welfare of poor populations (rather the present situation where the to LPG and power and other petroleum derivatives accrue much more to the upper and middle classes than to the poor). This affirmation now has rigorous empirical support in Ecuador (as it does in other countries) on the basis of results from the the of restructuring that Ecuador ultimately choses for its hydrocarbons subsector, it will need to take steps similar to those mentioned below: A. Amend negotiated contracts, like for example, in the case of marginal fields) and to give more attention to the heavy crudes that have been discovered recently as well as to natural gas. B. Establish a system of pricing and taxation which allows price at the refinery gate). 4.18 At the first stage, and to start with the more urgent matters, the crude for internal refining would be its This would generate additional public revenues of US$240 million per year, plus US$98 million per year from the increase in exports. This amount was calculated on second stage, prices would be set at their CIF levels, (except for fuel oil which would have a FOB price because it is exported). In a third stage, after the elimination of the monopoly of the State in \"downstream\" activities, storage, transport and distribution would be liberalized. In a fourth stage, the import of refined products would be freed, so that the refineries would have to compete against the importers (who could also be final consumers). This could push refineries to be more efficient or face loss of market. 4.20 As for exploration and production, the role of the private sector has been predominant until recently. Companies like Petroamazonas and Petroproducci6n are (this is not the case for downstream activities). In any case, the process of corporatization shares could be eventually sold. To make these companies stronger, high cost, marginal fields could be heaved off and transferred to private investors who would operate them. Hydrocarbons 57 4.21 What is now the Petroecuador head office would cease to exist and its functions, could be divided between: a. Those that should be handled directly by the State, including the promotion of exploration and production by oil companies which could be assigned to a regulatory entity (which could be the same one that regulates the electric power subsector). b. Operational functions (to the extent there are any) would go to the subsidiaries. In addition, while some of Petroecuador's subsidiaries or affiliates have been merged, over the objection of a previous Bank economic mission (June/July 1992) this report suggests that in order to prevent declines in productivity the and Petroproducci6n should not be merged. In the same way the Esmeraldas refinery could become an independent company (S.A.), buying its crude at the FOB price and selling its at their CIF value intervene if it wanted to subsidize any product). If a system such as this were adopted, it is likely that the old refineries (ex Anglo and Repetrol) of La Peninsula would not be able to compete and would have to close (maybe they should have been closed earlier, as soon as they reverted to the State in 1990). Reserves and Exploration: Current Situation 4.22 The amount of a controversial issue because figures differ according to how they are above all, who assesses them. The officially accepted figures are those of the National Hydrocarbons Directorate (Direcci6n Nacional de Hidrocarburos), assessment and less and international organizations. 4.23 It can now be reasonably be said that the country has 1.5 billion barrels of light oil (290 API) out of about 2 billion barrels in proven reserves. Of this, about 70% are in Petroecuador's oil fields. Also, about 400 million barrels of heavy crudes (15-20\u00b0 API) have been discovered by international oil companies in the last 5 years, as a result of the service contracts for hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation (These are included in the 2 billion reserve figure). 4.24 In view of the limited public financial resources available, foreign investment will continue to be essential, especially since, during the last decade, results from service contracts were relatively modest. Discovered reserves, on the order of 400 million barrels, are a great deal lower than the goal of 1 billion barrels which than expected, and the estimated time between the start of exploration and incorporation of production has doubled from five to ten years. Production costs will be between US$8 and US$10 per barrel, compared present costs At current, relatively low oil prices (late cy93), the economics of these discoveries will be, at best, marginal. 58 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, and there will in for new reserves. Increased reserves will come almost exclusively from those found through foreign investment, since oil exploration is a highly risky activity and the use of limited public resources for this purpose is not desirable. This could help accelerate the exploratory process due to better acceptance by international oil companies. Production: Current Situation 4.26 Current national oil production, close to 315 thousand barrels per day, is one of the highest recorded so far and will most likely be maintained, or even increased, within the next 5 years. Ecuador's oil production basically comes from the Amazon region. In 1992, average oil production amounted to 300,000 barrels per day and 315,000 barrels per day in March 1992, of which 98% was accounted for by Petroecuador (73% Petroamazonas and 25% Petroproducci6n) and 2% by foreign companies (City and Oryx). Private, foreign company output will continue to rise with production from the new fields of other international companies, but it is estimated that until 1996 at least 85% of production will come from Petroecuador's fields. Prospects 4.27 To maintain Petroecuador's current production and imperative to implement planned especially in Petroamazonas' fields. In addition, it is estimated that the companies that have made commercial discoveries (MAXUS, OCCIDENTAL, ORYX, ELF and TRIPETROL) will have to make investments of no less than US$750 million within the next 3 years to incorporate production of about 40,000 barrels per day. These investments amount to per day is to be attained. To achieve this, security will have to be ensured and the problems currently besetting private oil companies will have to be solved. 4.28 The production of heavy crudes needs to analyzed to determine whether the optimistic production forecasts made by the company Maxus, to the south of Bloc 16, can be achieved. Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that heavy crudes can only be produced and transported while light crudes are available to dilute them. In view of the uncertainty concerning the volume of heavy crudes that the aforementioned company will produce, the overall solutions proposed for the incorporation of these crudes in the oil industry (specially with respect to pipeline transport, refining and exports) will have to be carefully analyzed. In the domestic refining of these crudes be left for the future, since with prices nearer to economic the current refining capacity could perhaps be sufficient until the close of the decade if it is carefully complemented with the import of certain products. Hydrocarbons Scenarios 4.29 proposed. a. The low-production scenario assumes that of the different onstream fields continue to decline if there are no further investments in them. This year's (1992) production would 291,000 barrels per day; this trend would persist and by 1996 production would be down to 236,000 barrels per day and by 2000 down to 181,000 barrels per day. b. The average-production scenario assumes Government would continue with investment scheduled in Petroecuador's fields, which includes the allocation of resources to incorporate several fields and international companies making investments of the order of US$750 million to incorporate between 20,000 and 43,000 barrels per day within the next few years. Under this scenario, production of 305,000 barrels per day in 1992 would increase to 331,000 barrels per day in 1995 and fall to 314,000 barrels per day in 1996. c. The high- or optimistic-production scenario assumes that the be develop all discovered would be made; and that international companies would incorporate all the reserves found with an investment of and that optimistic forecasts day in 1994 and to 407,000 barrels per day in 1996, then fall to 312,000 barrels per day and 130,000 barrels per day in the years 2000 and 2010, respectively. 4.30 The average-production scenario is the most likely, although it may be a bit conservative and many observers believe that a peak output around 400 000 B/D is possible in the latter part of the decade, if increased output can be obtained, through increased investments the now operated by Slightly more detail is Oil Production Scenario (thousand barrels per day) Field 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Petroamazonas 225 223 221 218 209 Petroproduction 76 66 65 65 57 P.

In turn, another commission would analyze the contractual framework and the procedure which, in accordance with the Law, could be applicable to the Texaco proposal. 4.33 On July 1, 1992, the new operator, Petroamazonas, summoned offers behavior studies and performance forecasting of the Shushufindi-Aguarico field, the largest in the country. 4.34 The winner was American Scientific Software Intercomp, an internationally recognized company, which recently completed its report providing the following main conclusions: a. With a relatively low investment of US$148 million, a discounted cash flow of US$ 1.355 billion can be produced and obtained, during the 33 years assessed, that is, an investment-return ratio of 1/9. Hydrocarbons 61 b. The field's current production could be maintained at 100,000 barrels per day until 2003, thereafter declining to 34,000 barrels per day toward 2024. c. It is forecast that the accumulated production between 1972 and 1992 (700 million barrels) and between 1992 and 2024 (893 million barrels) will close estimate of d. Another 130 million barrels could be recovered in the decades after 2024 until the field becomes uneconomic. 4.35 The results of this study are based on production systems where the field operates on its own energy (primary recovery) and the installation of an artificial water-injection system (secondary recovery), and reveal the exceptional characteristics of the Shushufindi field oil deposits, where over 50% of the oil trapped underground could be recovered. 4.36 In view of Texaco's concern recovery), Petroecuador established a Coordination Unit to conduct, along with Scientific Software, the tertiary recovery studies applicable to the field and to study the availability of C02 in the country. These studies are being carried out and will be completed soon. These studies have to be completed and the performance of the fields should be carefully observed, to confirm whether the studies this method operates experimentally) alone of million. In addition, Petroamazonas calculates that, for an well P-80 (C02 producer), US$1 million would have lines and at economically sign a contract in keeping with laws prevailing at that time. 4.39 The preceding pages have especially focused on the supply-side of oil, that is, factors such as legislation, exploration and development investments in the preceding paragraphs and in the oil products has been identified as the major cause of be as follows: Elimination of the monopoly exercised by Petroecuador (and its affiliates) in oil activities. The valuation of oil at its economic cost, that is, its opportunity cost (the value of a barrel or gallon of oil sold at the best price that can be obtained). A more thorough regulatory framework dealing with the environmental aspects of oil exploration, production and industrialization to mitigate the negative impact of their activities on the environment. Environmental Aspects 4.40 Oil production, although crucial for Ecuador, should not necessarily damage the environment. There are techniques and procedures that are not prohibitive although the Hydrocarbons Law has been negative because it has not included the costs for avoiding, alleviating or repairing environmental damage in very low prices for domestic consumption promoted and production (and the environmental problems this implies) and has resulted in very (Chile, with a per-capita GDP more than twice that of Ecuador, uses only 25% more oil) contributing to air pollution in cities as well as soil and water pollution in production, refining, storage and transport areas. Once oil products are sold at their economic price, (that is, a price that fosters conservation and rational use of the product), efforts should be focused on repairing the damage incurred and establishing the standards to avoid a relapse (which would be costly, to meet the demand forecast by Petroecuador. If finance for expanded refining capacity is limited, the shortfall in importing a synthetic crude oil to processed at La Peninsula refinery instead of Oriente crude as at present. However, demand management options (pricing, energy conservation) have not been and future demand may well be over estimated. 4.42 The economics of refining in Ecuador should be relatively favorable, since both crude and product transport costs will lead to higher gross margins (in U.S. Gulf. Operating in Ecuador should in total be no higher than in the Hydrocarbons 63 U.S., while capital investment costs should be only about 5% higher than the U.S. But refining margins are volatile everywhere, economics should be considered cautiously. Considering the Petroleum Sector as a whole, investment in the upstream (exploration and production) is likely to warrant index\" of about 24 compared with an average of 56 in the U.S. (Ref. Oil and Gas Journal, May 4, 1992). With a surplus production of fuel oil now and expected in the future, as well as the production of heavier oils in the eastern regions, more conversion capacity must be a priority if any expansion can be justified. 4.44 Petroecuador has commissioned several studies that recommendations are: the installation of a fluid cracker for vacuum gas oil at La Peninsula, followed by a resid cracker at Esmeraldas at a future date; To revamp Esmeraldas to maintain light product output increases.9 of cases studied by BEICIP limited however, and did not fully explore the option of abandoning refining at Santa Elena, combined further expansion of Esmeraldas benefitting from economies of scale and, possibly, Amazonas. These options are worth further study. 4.45 As an interim measure, processing a synthetic crude at La Peninsula could be an attractive option, but the pricing terms of of good data on the extent Ecuador's urban air pollution problem, improvements to lead, high octane gasoline. Quito would best be recommendations for refining development should light pricing, energy conservation, for investment. 9 Oriente gravity does not increase (i.e. API does not decrease). This happens only if the heavier crude output is 64 Interfuel at Peninsula refinery, the option of closing down refining operations at Santa Elena, with an expansion of capacity at Esmeraldas, should be studied. refinery crude does grow (and refining the and should be implemented, so as to become operational in about 5 years. 4.49 The be the environmental sensitivity of the upper Amazon basis. 4.50 proposal to import a synthetic crude be processed at La Peninsula refinery should be followed up with negotiation for a more and more detailed consideration of the synthetic crude quality. The economics of is justified. As an to a could be implemented. The feasibility of supplying Quito and the Sierra with a lower octane gasoline than Guayaquil and the lowlands should be evaluated. Background 4.52 Ecuador's national oil company has since 1972 had the exclusive right to market refined products throughout Ecuador, and has built up its objective refineries, processing crude oil. Since the exploitation of the Oriente oilfields in the 1970s, the country's most important refining center moved to B/D refinery convenient to and export of surplus heavy fuel oil. taken eighties have increased Esmeraldas's 90.000 B/D. At present, Petroecuador is planning further expansion of the refining industry in view of continuing high rates of market growth. This growth in consumption may well slow as major changes in energy pricing policies are being considered by the new government. (August 1992). Extensive studies have been made by Petroecuador with the assistance of BEICIP. At the same time, considerable expansion of the pipeline network has been made. A further factor in future refinery development is the fact that Ecuador's reserves of light crudes have not increased and that future production will be heavier as the heavy crudes to be produced in block 16 are added to the Oriente crude mix. As an interim measure, Petroecuador is considering importing refinery, to increase product supply prior to refinery expansion. A study of this has been made by Petroecuador, with an internal report issued May 1992. This section reviews the refining centers have been proposed by the national company, e.g. at Pascuales to specifically serve Guayaquil. Feasibility studies have usually shown such projects to be economically unattractive. In general, a study of world refining expansion shows that most current expansion is through adding to large, existing refineries. There are in a single plant. Supply is likely to be more secure, in the event of a major disruption to a refinery or pipeline such as an accidental explosion, sabotage, or of an be processed, of refining processes, of transportation modes, and of product quality specifications. This is most efficiently done by a comprehensive linear programming model, as was used by BEICIP. It must depend to a large extent on forecasting of demand and crude It must also depend on judgement decisions as to what options are permitted to be considered by the model. As discussed below, Petroecuador may of closing the Peninsula refineries and supplying all product from Esmeraldas and Amazonas, expanded as required to balance demand growth, does not appear to have been explored the specific advantages of the two sites with good access to crude supplies from the eastern producing areas. 4.55 The economics of refining in Ecuador will continue to be dependent refining conditions in the North American area, since both crude and product prices relate to prices in should value, but reduced of heavy oil Esmeraldas yields are likely To secure supply petroleum develop the existing refining network, as an important part of the industrial sector and to provide specialized fuels for other industries such as power generation and cement manufacture; To add the reasons; qualities most suited to country, e.g. for -Reduced use of heavy fuel oil, as well as the trend to heavier crudes, has accelerated the growth of conversion capacity, i.e. to convert heavy fractions to light fractions for mainly transportation fuels; -Most growth in the refining sector is now through the expansion of existing larger, complex refineries; while many small hydroskimming refineries (such as the Penfnsula ones) are being shut down, since few are economically viable; -Tough environmental standards are leading to produce higher quality the supplied by each refinery. The Amazonas refinery is in the major oil producing region, which however only represents 2% of demand. The main advantage of this location is access to both crude and associated gas. The gas can be used both as refinery fuel, and also as a source of hydrogen for the treating of heavy oils. Also, the refinery could be integrated with heavy oil production, e.g. supplying fuel for steam generation, or supplying diluents. Another advantage of this location is that the plant is integrated with a gas processing plant recovering natural gas liquids from associated gas. These liquids are blended into gasoline and LPG products. disadvantages of this location are: The distance to major market areas, and to labor and services required for refinery operation; The difficulty of disposal of surplus residual fuel oil. Small quantities may be blended in the crude oil stream to be pipelined to the coast; It's environmentally the upper basin. 4.60 The major advantage of the Esmeraldas location is its access to both the main crude export pipeline, and to the port of Balao which facilitates both residual fuel exports and transportation of products by tanker to other Ecuadorean ports. It is relatively well located to serve the Quito area by pipeline, and now can also serve Guayaquil by pipeline. With the largest and most complex refinery in the country, it is a logical center for further expansion. 68 Ecuador: Energy refineries at Santa Elena was related to the early production of crude in this region, dating from the 1920s. Currently, crude production in this region is below 1,000B/D, so that crude supply proximity is no longer a reason for refining at Santa Elena. The present La Peninsula refinery, made up of two separate plants, only operates as a topping plant. In common with most simple refineries of this type without conversion capacity, the refinery is not now profitable when crude and products are valued at opportunity cost. The location has the disadvantage of a water shortage. On the positive side, it does have access to a port (with limitations), and is reasonably close to the Guayaquil market. Also, it is now connected by product pipelines to both Guayaquil and Manta. 4.62 operating costs, quoted as recently However, there costs at Esmeraldas may be underestimated. 4.63 Based on figures extracted from the reports under review, the relation between current refinery output and for about 20 MBD new capacity by the year 2000. The shortfall in LPG relates to the low subsidized retail price of this This demand projection assumes changes in indicated that it intends to introduce major shifts in these policies. If so, the growth in be stemmed, especially for LPG. Thus additional demand the year 2000 might only be about 10.000 B/D and could be handled through imports or additional investment at Esmeraldas, lower and relative lack of conversion by world standards all confirm that a next increment of processing capacity that this increment should be in service by the end of the decade. The economics of such an expansion are not assured was for Petroecuador to select a program of upgrading of both the Esmeraldas and La Peninsula (Santa Elena) refineries, over a period of eight years; (described as \"Case In Esmeraldas would be debottlenecked to a feed rate of 110,000 B/D. The major equipment additions and modifications included in Case 6C and the Esmeraldas debottleneck are predicated on processing a \"Total Blend\" which would include all the heavy oil production in a single mix both for export and for domestic processing. Although Case 6C shows a better Net Present Value than the other six cases selected for detailed study, the economics are not very robust, with a negative Net Present Value at a of 12%. 1 i.e. not doing anything) results in the lowest overall cost in all years through to 2010. 4.66 Some questions arise with regard to the selection of options investigated by BEICIP, as follows: Since one of the original reasons for locating at Santa Elena is no longer relevant, the closure of this refinery could provide savings in refining Closure plant was only considered by BEICIP in conjunction with a new refinery at Pascuales. It could be more attractive combined with a major expansion at Esmeraldas. Expansion of Esmeraldas beyond 110MB/D was not considered in any case studied, although with a 30 year horizon, this possibility must be evaluated. Why is an expansion of Amazonas not considered in conjunction with other refinery expansion? Considering the possibility of a conversion refinery at Amazonas, with an expansion of pipeline capacity to the Quito area, could be worth study. The investment in refinery capacity required in Ecuador to balance demand to is not Studies\", Final Report, undated draft. ii) \"Study of the Development of Refining and Distribution in Ecuador\", Phase 2, Jan. requirements years to come and none of the heavier crude has, as yet, been produced. 4.67 In considering the expansion of La Peninsula, BEICIP point out that the revamping of the existing distillation units included of the plants to be deteriorated (which it most likely is, given the age of the plants). They also recommend replacement of the topping plants with This almost means building a new grassroots refinery and could be thus be almost as unattractive as the Pascuales refinery proposal. It would on abandonment this or just preserving if processing of reconstituted crudes discussed below, or operating it as an oil terminal and storage facility. 4.68 In case La Peninsula refinery were to be modernized and expanded, the proposal also calls for the construction of a crude oil pipeline from Santo Domingo to La Peninsula. However, the economics (illustrated on page 83 of the first report) are not convincing. It is not clear why tanker costs are expected to escalate at 8% per annum, a key assumption in the economic analysis. The use of tanker transport would likely require some port and storage improvements, but at lower cost than the pipeline. It may be noted that a similar concern was expressed during the energy assessment of 1985, with regard to the Libertad-Manta pipeline, the construction of which resulted heavier oils are likely to be the best lowest cost option, unless a supply of light specifically under would remain into century, would result in the lowest investment. 4.70 The economics of all cases were calculated by BEICIP assuming a 20 year project life and a 30% residual value. This is optimistic for refinery processing projects which are subject and often sensitive to the following risks: price crude availability and quality due to the success or failure of exploration and development, -changes in the technology of fuel utilization. among others. In particular, the 30% residual value is unrealistic since most refining equipment has a zero or negative residual value, considering site cleanup and dismantling cost. Hydrocarbons 71 Synthetic Crude Proposal 4.71 This proposal is set out in a Petroecuador report dated May, 1992. It is based on an offer by the company C. Itoh to supply a synthetic crude oil, to be processed in the La Peninsula refinery to make lead free gasoline, middle distillates, and virtually no heavy fuel oil. The operation is proposed as an interim measure, prior to the installation capacity relatively simple as a hydroskimming refinery. It could be produced a heavy oil, such as the synthetic crudes produced in Canada, or it could be similar to the reconstituted crudes that have been produced in the Caribbean export refineries for many years, from conventional crudes. The yields of products shown in the report virtually a mixture of processing a recon crude at La Peninsula refinery could be attractive for Ecuador for a number of reasons: It would reduce the volume of low value residual fuel that must be exported, prior to expansion of conversion capacity; It could delay the need to install new refining capacity, while providing product at lower cost than product tankers that carry export from Ecuador (which is the case); It would be a good use for the refinery in its configuration, larger volumes of clean product to the major market of the Guayaquil area, closer to this refinery; It would in price asked for the synthetic crude is too high. The price proposed CIF La Peninsula was to be according to the formula: 1.8* (Oriente price FOB Balao). The price of the synthetic should be lower than parity prices shown BEICIP's the synthetic factor in the formula should be 1.68, without allowing for the lower freight cost of dirty versus clean tankers, or the savings accruing from a backhaul. are considered, the factor should be below 1.60. 4.75 The Petroecuador study considered four cases, all related to La Penfnsula operations. They included: a. Processing Oriente as at present, b Processing a light crude, e.g. Bonny Light, c. Adding conversion capacity to the refinery, d. C. Itoh's recon crude proposal. The last three all represent ways to reduce surplus heavy fuel production and give a better balance with demand. No changes to Esmeraldas or Amazonas refineries are considered in combination with the above options. 4.76 The economic analysis (commencing on page 21 of Petroecuador's report), is flawed in it in Ecuador. Since this demand must in any case be met, the appropriate value should be the opportunity cost, i.e. the cost of product imports. When import parity prices are used in the analysis, advantage for the recon proposal disappears. Refining Oriente crude as at present becomes more attractive. This is (shown The report points out that the economics are sensitive to the difference in values between Oriente crude and the recon crude. The value of export fuel oil used in their study was 9.72$/B; this is lower than would be expected at present. The current USG spot price of 3% sulfur fuel oil is 13.0$/B, indicating a price FOB La Libertad of about 11.0 $/B. This also distorts the economics in favor of the recon proposal. 4.78 Any contract for the to best balance any shortfalls in domestic production, and to match current market quality requirements.

The most common ones are: I. Economic efficiency II. Equity Im. Cost recovery IV.

Stated differently, they provide consumers/buyers with the correct information about costs system incurs serve demand. Moreover, since efficient prices have to the market, they are just equal to what consumers are willing to pay for being supplied with electricity. 2. Efficient electricity pricing is since efficient prices may vary by time of use due to factors that are beyond the control of a particular consumer/supplier, long-term contracts offer the opportunity to hedge against the of price fluctuations. For example, a generator can sell a contract under which the consumer/buyer has the option to purchase (at some date in the future), say, 1 MWh for $30 (3 cents/kWh). At any point in time, the value that this contract has to the consumer is equal to the difference between the actual (efficient) price prevailing in the market, p(t), and 3 cents/kWh, times 1,000 kWh, i.e. [p(t) -3 cents/kWh] 1,000 kWh. By the same if 3 exercise the option to buy. Moreover, perfect markets, the price of the contract/option would approach a level at the returns/benefits from trading electricity, without violating the principle of efficient pricing. 3. Efficient prices are in the provide (or suppliers) among consumers, some users would willing to higher price than that granted to the subsidized ones so brokering of electricity -if it were feasible- would eventually equity argument is a particularly strong opinions about what characterizes equitable prices. at this point, though, one This means provision of extra costs above and beyond the monetary value of the subsidies. The size of these extra costs depends on how and by whom the subsidy financed. kept at a minimum, (ii) the subsidies are financed in a neutral way, (iii) the subsidies are precisely targeted to the group that is intended to benefit from the measure, and (iv) the (estimated) benefits that accrue to the target group are at least as high as the direct costs of the subsidies. 4. Equity considerations aside, there problems efficient prices may not yield a \"fair\" or \"adequate\" rate of return. It can be argued, however, that cost recovery, and more so profits , may come at the expense of economic efficiency (to the extend that it requires a departure from SRMC-pricing). While the argument is valid in theory to raise funds from non-government sources or, as the case may be, attract private investors whenever this is needed or desirable. Finally, a regulated utility that does business in the quest of profits is more likely to cut costs and diversify its services than would be an executive branch of the government that runs the sector on the basis of general budget allocations. Likewise, electricity prices that support commercial goals, but are not fully congruent with the ideal of economic efficiency, tend to outperform tariff systems that (at best) to be efficient, yet provide to operate in an efficient way. 5. So convincing is the case that can be made for SRMC-pricing on theoretical grounds, so difficult is its implementation in practice. As been stressed in para 1, perfectly designed efficient tariffs have to continuously adjust over Bearing this in electricity prices are often prices\". goal. Even tariffs that only remotely resemble the ideal spot pricing and communications technologies would spot Also, utilities and electricity users must be able to digest and harness a large amount of information. So in most circumstances, particularly when demand and supply are not pursuit of a perfectly efficient pricing policy is not worth the effort. Consequently, the ideal of economic efficiency has to be reconciled with the limited abilities of electricity suppliers and users to signal, and a compromise between the requirements of economic efficiency and the actual capabilities to meet these requirements. As has been outlined before, there are number of constraints and risks Responsible takes tariffs should be structured as to inform users about the costs they impose on the system. That is, the design of the tariff system should be structurally correct, not at least recover its costs. It is worth noting in this connection that if prices are based on load-specific average costs, they will satisfy the first two requirements. Third, the tariff system should be compatible with commercial goals. In particular, if the power sector has to strive for scarce financial resources, the will have a decisive impact on whether and to what extent scarce resources are made available to the sector. Fourth, attributable to the consecutive services (generation, transmission, etc), that the sector performs in supplying its customers. Fifth, says it services in terms of price, customers should be given the opportunity to choose among these services. 8. The last two requirements under is an issue relevant to the division of labor between power generation, transmission, and distribution. In particular, the current structure of Ecuador's power sector lends itself to a solution that strengthens the corporate identity of the distribution companies. By the same token, it is opportune to increase the distribution companies' responsibility for tariffs set at the retail level. Since services and costs vary across the country's franchised discretion to custom-tailor their tariffs system: One for bulk power transactions between the generation and transmission complex and its wholesale customers (the distribution companies and, as the case may be, large industrial users), and one that applies to the retail level and reflects the different infrastructural and economic characteristics of the distribution areas. Once a coherent system of tariffs for bulk supplies is in place (differentiated by load, voltage level, and location), the distribution companies should be held responsible for selecting a mix of bulk and own generation that serves their customers at In a later stage, may become feasible that the transmission system facilitates power wheeling operations between different distribution companies, provided that this option proves to be economically advantageous. 9. tariffs that of regional differences may appear to be discriminatory. However, this will not be the case as long as tariff differentials are a mere response to of regional disparity and uneven address imbalances. Also, in the past policy makers seemed to believe that they have a social obligation to subsidize and encourage the of electricity. Electricity, however is a valuable good, and in general households that are able to pay for the consumption of this good are also willing to do so. So there is absolutely no need to charge them less than it costs to apply to low-income, low-volume consumers that have access to, or the financiable without large deadweight losses. 10. While it appears logical and feasible to diversify tariffs at the retail level, perfect unbundling of transmission services is often considered to be too complex an issue to be manageable in practical applications. Also, the benefits sophisticated and administer such a refinement. So that INECEL's recently completed tariff study disaggregate transmission charges. This approach can be justified for two reasons. First, from an accounting point of view, it is more convenient to charge network costs and the costs transmission services on a per kW and per kWh basis, without regard to spatial differences along the network. Moreover, if bulk power generation and transmission are performed by a singly entity (as is the case under the current institutional framework of Ecuador's power sector), transmission support services (e.g. voltage support, frequency control) and line losses can be considered a common cost to the system (e.g. generation and transmission). And as long as unbundled tariffs for bulk power supplies recover these costs, no pressing to disaggregate and price underlying cause and effect relationships. Second, and more importantly, disaggregated pricing of the impact that net-injections at each node have on the whole system (e.g. in terms of line flows, dispatch) may be redundant if spatial differences are negligible or net themselves out over time. Whether or not this is the case under the current operating conditions of Ecuador's power sector remains to be investigated. 11. At any rate, some sort of disaggregated transmission pricing will be independent power generators (IPP's) or generating facilities operated the distribution companies are permitted to wheel power across the transmission system. In this event, these should be priced on the basis of \"avoided costs\" to the rest of the system, i.e., the costs, net of any savings, that the system would experience in the absence of these supplies. Clearly, avoided i.e. the extra may impose on the system strongly depend on the way in which they impact the line flows in the network and the merit order dispatch of the system's generating plant. A rational tariff system should account facilities independent or non-utility particularly up a bulk power STUDY 1. INECEL's new tariff study was completed in March 1992. Its implementation (which this report strongly endorses) could make an important contribution to restoring the financial health of the sector and enhancing the incentive framework of its operators and customers. The study is of loads. It calls for an increase in the level and a change in the structure and number of rates applying to and account for line losses and the costs of transmission and distribution services. Compared to the rates which are currently in place, the new system would increase average tariffs by 3.0 UScents/kWh for industrial users, for commercial users, and 5.7 UScents/kWh for residential customers. In order calculate the unit costs, the study assumed that the costs of meeting a marginal increase in peak load (CMP) plus the system's average marginal energy costs (CME) are equal to average incremental generating costs. The latter are defined as the ratio (R) of discounted annual changes in system expansion costs (net of transmission and generation) to discounted annual changes in future demand, averaged over a planning horizon of 13 years (T). Hence, the basic equation can be written as R/T = CMP + CME (For details, see Annex III). The study also assumed that the peaker plant is a gas turbine with annuitized costs of 78.9$/kW and a load factor of 0.61. CMP = 14.8 USCents/kWh. Moreover, based on the cost system the corresponding demand forecast, the study's estimate of R $kW/year plant, system's marginated energy costs, as is shown in the first row of Table 1.7. 3. The average costs of providing, maintaining, and operating transmission and subtransmission usually expressed as the ratio of discounted expenses for these services to the discounted future flows (in kW) through the lines of the network. It is also common to lump these costs together with the costs of load that under normal Annex 2: Tariff Design 81 conditions gets lost (for technical within the transmission and subtransmission network. The same approach has been used by the tariff study, and the resulting figures ($/kW) are presented in the first column of Table 1.7. The second column of the table indicates how average energy costs increase in direct proportion to line losses that occur along the transmission chain. although costs cost estimates shown in Table 1.7 are broken down along the distribution chain and reflect systemwide averages. 4. Table 1.8 shows how electricity supply costs, broken down to the subtransmission level on average vary by season and time-of-day. hydropotential lasts from November to March, accounts for 150 days a year. Peak demand occurs between 7pm and lOpm, whereas base load period and 8am. The seasonal impact on energy costs overwhelm associated with daily fluctuations of load. Energy costs vary by about 6 USCents/kWh seasonally, while the cost differential during the day is at most 1 USCents/kWh. 5. Based on the calculation of electricity supply costs, the study proposes a system of tariffs that can be categorized in terms of the location where load is (Nodes): Tariffs to bulk supplies purchased by distribution companies at nodes along the 230 kV transmission system. (ii) High voltage level: Tariffs apply to bulk supplies delivered to large users voltage levels between and 46 kV. (iii) Medium voltage level: Tariffs apply to customers served by distribution companies at voltage levels between 22 and 6.3 kV. (iv) Low voltage level: Tariffs apply to customers served by distribution companies 115/120 and 210/220 V. In addition, the Low The system be the level and of the proposed deviate meeting load. energy charges, on the other hand, exceed the corresponding cost figures (except for the low-voltage level). Also, tariffs tend to smooth out cost differentials between the wet and dry season. This is because transmission line costs the accumulated medium voltage capacity charges are factors). The demand charges only costs of the distribution system (adjusted for coincidence factors). And the consumer class specific energy rates do not vary by time-of-day or season. (iii) There is a rate for public However, the proposed system renders the sector financially viable, i.e. does not call for government transfers. 7. Some of the features of for electricity may cause cash- flow problems, particularly on the part of structure, is not very persuasive. importantly, there is for off-peak since buyers of bulk supplies load on an hourly basis. Also, the of transparent form of separate charges. There are other shortcomings that are attributable to the lack of reliable demand example, through tariff revisions tuning. At any rate, ways of one. 8. Given the fact that Ecuador's electricity sector is not only capacity-and energy constrained, but also faces formidable difficulties in obtaining the resources needed for further expansion, the implementation of the new tariff system becomes a matter of utmost concern. It will curb excessive demand through allocating scarce supplies than rationing-, and help sector a sound financial basis for improving and increasing its services. To achieve these goals, there is no long way to go. Highest priority should be given 1988 which guides de current and is incompatible with the proposed new tariff regime. This will lay the groundwork for of the urgently needed changes in tariff policy. In a second step, the legal and regulatory framework can be adjusted to comply with the requirements the study approximates the projected stream of future electricity sales E (t), expressed in MWh, by the exponential growth function.

I. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 1. Economic measures proposed for Ecuador are to essentially bring prices to their reflect opportunity costs (mostly prices FOB Ecuador) and for electricity tariffs to reflect Long Run Marginal Costs (LRMC). 2. These measures have the proposed pricing policy the fiscal lower inflation rates would be is a \"mitigated\" removal of the oil and power subsidies, that is price deregulation along with social mitigation policies, would generate enough public revenues to eliminate the deficit, and by eliminating the need for monetary financing of this deficit, eliminate inflation. Can social welfare and a fiscal surplus be reconciled? In other words, what would low-income households the economy as a whole gain from the elimination of energy price subsidies? Will the inflation problem of the Ecuadorean ever resolved? The analysis of this issue focuses on three groups of questions: (a) How much the fiscal deficit would be reduced by the removal of oil and power subsidies? The answer deals with the limits of public choice and political decision process. However, in the short run it can be assumed that public revenues generated by prices at economic level would not be offset by automatic equivalent expenditure growth. extent to which monetary emission be reduced deficit were eliminated depends upon external financing of the deficit. That is, on the ratio between external and domestic funding of the public sector. The answer also depends upon the balance of payments origin of the money supply and the related sterilization policy. (c) The third question is about the impact of a reduced fiscal deficit the inflationary the liquidity ratio of the economy, the velocity of money and consumer behavior in terms of demand for real balances. Annex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 87 Data are from the Ministry of Finance and from the Banco Central Del Ecuador. A uniform statistical source is used for consistency, even through available statistics on public finance are sketchy. In fact, National Accounts and IMF data differ in coverage precluding a direct comparison. 4. second summarizes Ecuador's monetary and inflationary trends from 1986 to model is used to simulate the deflationary impact for 1991. Conclusions A. of the Global of Subsidies 5. The effects of increased energy prices on public revenues, fiscal deficit, money supply and inflation are summarized in Table 1. The simulation for 1991 show that eliminating oil and power subsidies would definitely eliminate the fiscal and in generate a substantial fiscal surplus of 344 or 2.8 per cent of GDP. Monetary financing of the public deficit will no longer be required, and since the domestic component of monetary emission will eliminated, the rate of inflation will be drastically reduced, by about 60 per cent. Moreover, negative changes monetary base (-237 bn impact) will represent a net accumulation of positive balances in the Central Bank and in other public financial institutions. In 1991, eliminating oil sum both would be S/575 billion of 4.7 of GDP. component of will international reserves. This residual emission explains, interalia the 40 per cent residual inflation. In the long term, however, this external cause of inflation could be offset. Calculation shows that, if the monetary consequences (of international reserves) could be totally avoided, the inflation rate would be reduced by more can the monetary consequences of the of international reserves. First, the net accumulation of positive balances in the Central Bank by the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) will compensate the balance of payments surpluses and the related increase in monetary base. Inflation be reduced. As a result, domestic saving will increase, leading to additional sterilization of high powered money. Second, the cure of inflation will restore Ecuadorean competitiveness. Depreciation of the local currency will stop as well as the revaluation of the stock of international monetary Monetary reduction of inflation, within an interval between -60 and -100 per cent, definitely stopping deflationary performances will be achieved even if, in line with more recent pronouncements, some of the additional revenues were used to compensate the poor people who bear a large share of adjustment costs. In fact, calculations show that even if one- third of additional revenues (192 billion Sucres) were used mitigate emission and, thence, to dramatically reduce inflation. Thus, even in the case of sizeable social mitigation, (arising 1/3 of new revenues to this purpose) the consolidated fiscal deficit will be more thant eliminated, going from 230.8 billion Sucres in 1991 (-1.9 per of GDP) to a surplus of 152.6 billion (+1.2 per cent of GDP). While figures do not seem important in terms of GDP, it is worth noting that this surplus is a net surplus, since social costs are already covered. In this case, the absolute reduction in inflation, in the long-term, is of the order of 95 per cent, that is, virtually no inflation. Since this price correction is the result of 86.4 per cent reduction in emission, the related price elasticity will be about 1.10, which is very much in line with the recent evolution of the Ecuadorean economy (see para. 34). This the impact calculations. ECUADOR -Impact of Increased Energy Prices on Public Revenues, Fiscal Deficit.

In The removal of oil subsidies would result 111 bn Sucre fiscal surplus. This would lead to a 77 cent a successive decrease from -35 to -83 per cent in the general price index. The 1991 simulation shows that inflation would have fallen from 50 per cent to the much more acceptable limit of 8.5 per cent. In fact, this reduction of inflation will be more profitable to low-income households in terms of on petroleum prices were Mio US$ (low production scenario) and 464.7 Mio US$ (high scenario). Here, only the low production scenario (342 bn subsidies) was considered. Economic measures proposed bring all prices to their economic levels. Simulations were made under this assumption. D. Results of the Elimination of Power Subsidies 9. Similarly, elimination of 233 billion sucres in subsidies in the power subsector in 1991 would result in a 58 per cent reduced inflation. This result is important compared to the size of the power sub-sector in terms of GDP. Figures for one sub-sector are given for ease of since price would not take place). III. DETERMINATION OF THE FISCAL DEFICIT Additional Public Revenues 10. The oil and power subsectors are state property, under the monopolistic control of public enterprises. Non-Financial Public Sector revenues will increase by the same amount as oil and power subsidies are cut, since oil and power revenues are assigned by law to the public sector (not necessarily the public enterprises as Petroecuador's income is largely independent the which products are sold domestically). The Ecuadorean Public Sector receives the public enterprises after deduction of retail margins. According to law, Petroecuador must deposit all of its revenues at the Central Bank, which in turn distributes them according to the rules of earmarked revenues, including those to be received by the company (to cover its costs). Thus, the financial results of Petroecuador are net results for the State. These results assume essentially no operating costs of sector enterprises. 11. Total subsidies that can be recovered (under the low estimate) are S/575 billion for 1991, and S/775 billion under the high estimate. The calculation of electric power subsidies was based US$0.041 in barrel, that is, thebalance between the opportunity cost (US$15/barrel in 1991) and the implicit price of domesticcrude entering the refinery (US$3.5/barrel). The subsidies for 1991 wasabout S/342 billion'2. 12. The ratio of oil subsidies to total Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) oil revenues(exports and domestic sales) the only 0.3% in 1991. However, in thelong run (after 1996), (Table TABLE 2 ECUADOR -Estimates of Oil and Power Subsidies. 1991 (Billions of Sucres) 1991 Oil Prices Power Oil and (After estimates and INE.

The consolidated fiscal deficit and the impact of the elimination of subsidies 15. The consolidated fiscal deficit is presented in Tables 6 and 7 as a percentage of GDP and in nominal amounts, respectively. The impact of increased energy prices on the overall fiscal result will be substantial on a cash basis. First, because on a achieved 1990 and 199113 .A second reason is the role of oil revenues and subsidies in the NFPS's balance sheet. Oil revenues amounted roughly one of and the most powerful 1983- 1989, oil revenues ranged from a minimum of 31% of total revenues in 1987 to a maximum of 51% in 1985. For 1991, the ratio was 34.7%. 16. Variants of this impact are presented in Table 8. In the case of social mnitigation policies, the elimination of oil and power subsidies will generate, on a cash basis, large fiscal to (high estimate). As high powered money is issued on a cash basis, the fiscal surplus should lead to a reduction in the monetary base, as seen below, due to massive public saving and the related accumulation of positive balances in the Central Bank. Even on an accrual basis, social no deficit (S/- 127.2 billion) low This accrual result is important since it the depreciation of the sucre.

The budget, however, still remains the major instrument in Government attempts to reduce the overall non-financial public sector deficit (financial adjustment of 6.5% of GDP was achieved through the Budget between 1982 and 1985). Annex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power THE MONETARY IMPACT Empirical Preliminaries The consistency fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic targets can be judged by looking at the Government Budget's constraint. This constraint says that the sum of non- interest deficit and the interest bill on foreign and domestic debt is equal to the sum of financing from all sources. Fiscal deficits can monetary financing is on the demand-side. Expenditures demand of the public sector (all government entities along with the Central Bank) must be covered as follows: (1) CFD = EF* + DCg + DLg where: CFD = consolidated fiscal deficit, on an accrual basis = D + iB + i*(B* -IR)e, as calculated in Table 7 15 DCg = Central Bank advances to the public sector = the monetary financing. DLg = Loans of the domestic banking system the private sector: DL = D(l-m) are private deposits. is lack of private resources (DLg decreased as deposits D were under- borrowing (VEF was -2.6 % of GDP in and -1.9 % in 1991, as shown in Table 5), the Ecuadorean Government asked (DCg) the deficit. by accumulation of external-interest arrears. Between 1987 and 1991, impacts on inflation, economic growth and balance of payments have been lessened by the fact that Ecuador was granted grace periods on its external debt. Deriving the IS Table 7, where: deficit i foreign*) debt e = nominal exchange rate IR = international 98 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution deficit and money creation should thus be performed on a cash basis. The consolidated fiscal deficit must be made net of external arrears (EXA). From demand- equation (1) and identity (2) we can derive that: (3) CFD = (VEF EXA)* second to the monetary financing -i.e. to money creation -is on the supply side. First, the Central bank issues base money (H) to cover credits to the government (DCg) and to the private sector (CPS), and to cover the Central Bank's accumulated profits or net worth (NW). It is the endogenous component of monetary emission. also result from the accumulation of international reserves (IR *) due to the surplus of the balance of payments 16. It constitutes the exogenous component of the monetary emission. The supply-equation yields: (4) H = DCg + IR*e -NW + CPS where: H = high powered money or base money (B) mD + (c + m(l-c)). M where: M = MI = f (Price P, domestic interest id, Y) D = private deposits = f (P, id, Y) m = reserve ratio on deposits D c = currency/MI ratio IR*e = international reserves IR*, revaluated at the cent of GDP in 1989, that is Sucres 11,448 Mio (see Table 6). Thus, income on external operations are negligible for the Ecuadorean Central Bank. So we can simplify: (4') H = DCg + IR*e + the serve a domestic purpose: financing, in Ecuador, a devaluation (e) of 3 % to 8.5 % per month. A vicious circle is initiated, leading from excess monetary to inflation international to more monetary emission. 16 Large surpluses of the balance of payments were at play in Ecuador in 1989 and 1990. These amounts of USD 382 million and USD 402 million, as shown in Table 10, were the origin of for these respective years. Annex 4: Elimination Oil and Power Subsidies 99 The model 19. Deriving the relation between the fiscal deficit, money creation and debt will thus begin with the following accounting balances of the Central Bank: (5) DCg = (issuing Bonds of values yields: (8) ME -IR*e = H -IR*e = CFD -EXA + CPS Equation (8) as it stands, although, no more than accounting, supports with TO RESERVES ACCUMULATION Units 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 Commercial the Mio USS -33,00 619,00 661,00 1003,00 245,50 the adjustments 2/ \"Mediante Decreto N\u00b0 50 de agosto 30 de 1988, se fijo la tasa oficial de cambio en S/390,00 por d6lar, que rige dnicamente para efectos contables en el balance del Banco Central\" (BCE, Boletfn n' 15 de 1991) 3/ BCE, Memoria 1990,: \"corresponde a cambio contable\". 4/ BCE, idem: \"Al 31 de diciembre de 1990, la emisi6n monetaria registr6 un saldo de 294,7 billiones de Sucres.

However, nominal data on external (EXA) arbitrary or questionable, and data from the Ministry of Finance or from IMF-World Bank differ substantially).

The coefficient a2 should be positive since additional credit to private sector increases money base Ml. The resulting equation yields: .84 of quarterly distributed 1-1984 and Sandee method) 21. The results show that both fiscal deficit (CFD) and external arrears (EXA) have a strong and endogenous money emission (ME-IR*e): global elasticity is high with respect to cash consolidated fiscal deficit. Signs of the coefficients are as expected : al is positive since CFD enters the regression with negative eliminates the whole oil-and-power-subsidies for 1991 (575 billions of Sucres). It brings an equivalent additional amount in public revenues. Under this scenario, the consolidated fiscal deficit (CFD) disappears as a whole (on an accrual basis), coming from a gap of -510.2 bn Sucres fiscal absolute variation is -112.7 as compared initial deficit). magnitude of the monetary impact consecutive to of Oil Power Subsidies variation in fiscal deficit yields to a 129.5 per reduction in (ME-IR*e), a 1.15 Variants are presented in Table 1. 23. If one-third of the additional public revenues are used to finance social mnitigation policies, thence benefits will only be 383 bn Sucres and consolidated fiscal deficit (CFD) will be -127.2 bn Sucres (if compared with the initial deficit, this reduction = 75 % in absolute figures). Lowering the fiscal deficit will result in reduction in the endogenous strong emission does. There is a multiplicative virtuous effect of cutting down public deficit, MEASUREMENT OF THE itself into a deflationary impact of same magnitude ? Inflation is a complex process. However, in case of fiscal deficits coupled with constant ratios of debt to output, the public finance approach to inflation However, this relation can be dampened or accelerated by business factors. Second, general price level reacts to the global monetary emission (Ms), not Ms-IR). financing of The Banco del Ecuador often used to monetize its international reserves as an indirect way of financing the public external debt. In case of such bookkeeping practice, we could assimilate the global monetary emission (Ms) to the addition of direct and indirect (hidden) fiscal monetary financings: (11) = (Ms-IR) + IR where: (Ms-IR) = monetary financing of CFD direct flnancin2 hidden means that, and 1991 for example, most of the monetary emission (Ms) was devoted to finance the public sector (Table 9). '7While many of the considerations in this appendix are not germane to the analysis of energy subsidies, they are attached for the sake for completeness, in case some readers may want to see how equations were formulated and justified. 102 Ecuador: with the equilibrium condition on the money market: (13) Ms = Md = P .y .1/v (P) (Friedman's quantity theory) = P .y .m/y (since v = y/m and dP/P = k) Rearranging terms: P Ms .l/y .y/m Where Md is the demand for nominal balances, m the demand for real balances, y the real income, v the velocity of money, P the general price level. Econometric calculation demonstrates that the above price Ecuadorean money market realities: (21c) In PRICE, = -4.84 + 1.151 In ME, -.054 In Trend(y), (.048) (.042) where: PRICE is for P; Trend(y) for y; ME for to From equation (21c) and identity (11) we can derive: (22) In PRICE, = -4.84 + 1.151 In ((ME-IR*e) + IR*e) -.054 In or exogenous component of monetary emission; (e) is the current exchange rate, (IR) the international reserves. 27. As (ME-IR*e) is referred to as the direct fiscal financing, and IR*e as the indirect financing, any variation in the fiscal deficit, in case of monetization, will affect the global monetary emission (Ms), and (P), directlv via (ME-IR*e) and indirectly via IR*e. The direct price impact is a short-run impact, due to the monetization of the cash consolidated fiscal deficit (CFD). The indirect impact, due to reserves monetization, could be assimilate occurs only under mutatis mutandis condition: if the current exchange rate (e) will be or not stabilised, or if the balance of payments surpluses will be not sterilised. debt of the Central Bank (the accrued quasi-fiscal deficit), which is 50 per cent rescheduled external debt. Direct deflationary impact 28. scenarios are presented in Table 1. Thereunder we envisage the case of putting all prices at their economic level. The results show that under this scenario the above-mentioned reduction of 129.5 per cent (as compared with the initial level) in the direct financing of the fiscal will reduce \"See Annex 4: Elimination of Oil and Power Subsidies 103 inflation as much as 59 %19.

In the same way, global price impact will be a long-run process, since involving envisaged with caution. 30. The short-run or direct reduction of 59 % in the inflation level, will lead mutatis mutandis to lowering the local devaluation process or monetization emission ((ME-IR*e) + IR*e) is eliminated as much as 100 %, simulation shows that inflation (P) should be 'theoretically' reduced as much as 134 % from its actual 1991 level.

Inflation growth rate will fall from +50.5 % (actual 1991 rate) to +2.5 %, that is practically no more inflation. 19 The remainder 41 % inflation are due to the monetization of international reserves: i.e. the indirect (or hidden) fiscal financing. 20 Separate calculations are not easy. The linear regression's coefficient al in equation (22) is referred to as the elasticity of (P) with respect to variation in the whole monetary emission (Ms). Calculating of monetary emission (Ms) asks for more complete statistical data, which were not available. 104 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, the fiscal deficit and the monetization of the international reserves (after BCE had recovered its monetary functions) will stop the monetary emission. In equation (22) Ms = ((ME-IR*e) + IR*e) = 0. Thence, equation (22) PRICE = -4.84 -.054 In TREND(y) (aO < O) (a2 < 0) Depressed business factors lead in 1991 to a negative price index (-1,548.6) or at least to a zero price index in equation (23). It means that the real Ecuadorean economy is deflate: the private sector, referred to as the productive sector, is depressed because unremunerated. Resources are mis-allocated. Demand for falling to compensate for expected high fiscal-related inflation. 33. In the long-run, some of the direct and indirect sources of inflation could be offset as a rational consequence of better resources allocation. First, the elimination of subsidies should help the Banco Central del Ecuador (BCE) to recover its monetary policy function. In fact, a could provide the Government with the ability thus be re-transferred to the Central Government. There is no reason why the BCE should continue to play a marked role in fiscal and financial intermediation. As the paper shows, the BCE does not need to run any deficit, if its only function were that of regulating monetary aggregates. In addition, of reserve's accumulation due the balance of payments. 34. Reserve monetization is the other cause of inflation. In fact, two factors can offset the monetary consequences of the accumulation of international resources. First, the net accumulation of positive balances in the CBE by the Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) will compensate the balance of payments' surpluses and the related increase in monetary base. Inflation be reduced. As a result, domestic saving will increase, leading to additional sterilisation of high powered money. Second the cure of inflation will restore Ecuadorean competitiveness. Depreciation of the local currency will be slowed, as will the related revaluation of -60 % and -100 %.

La investigaci6n se realiz6 en base a documentos y estudios realizados anteriormente y a un trabajo de campo en las ciudades de Quito, Guayaquil y Cuenca, en las ferias libres y en los puestos fijos de distribuci6n, mediante entrevistas a mas de 200 demandantes y a 12 distribuidores. Las conclusiones y recomendaciones responden a las vivencias de la investigaci6n de campo y a la informaci6n sistematizada, proporcionada por Petrocomercial. Aspiramos que este documento contribuya al esclarecimiento del problema para la toma de decisiones en beneficio del Estado y del bienestar de los consumidores. 108 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution RESUMEN EJECUTIVO Esta investigaci6n fue realizada antes de la expedici6n de las medidas de incremento de precios de los combustibles por lo que los precios de venta del kerex que se detectaron tienen como referencia los precios vigentes para esa epoca. En primer lugar, es notoria la drastica reducci6n del consumo de kerex a nivel nacional, de 33.8 millones de galones en 1988 a 16.2 en 1991, como consecuencia, por un lado, del propio sistema de comercializaci6n restringida y, por otro, del precio del gas licuado de petr6leo que se ha mantenido en niveles bajos y que al mismo tiempo ofrece un elevado nivel de confort para los usuarios. Bajo la perspectiva de que el kerex es un combustible estrechamente vinculado al consumo de los sectores populares, ha recibido elevados niveles de subsidio, pero parad6jicamente estos sectores se benefician en una reducida proporci6n del mismo al altisimo subsidio extendido al GLP. El actual sistema de comercializaci6n consiste en la distribuci6n directa a comunidades, organismos publicos de salud, etc, por parte de Petroecuador y, en las ciudades, la venta al consumidor final se localiza en las ferias libres y en puestos especificos. En los centros de distribuci6n existe racionamiento, que en algunos casos restringe la venta a un maximo de dos galones por persona. Este racionamiento ocasiona la formaci6n de largas colas, concurridas por grupos organizados que involucran la participaci6n de toda la familia, incluidos menores de edad y que generalmente acaparan el producto para revenderlo a los consumidores finales a precios que oscilaban entre S/250 y S/650 / gal6n y aun mas, dependiendo de la distancia y el grado de aislamiento del lugar. En el area rural y en areas marginales este producto se comercializa aun en botellas, con costos que superaban con creces lo indicado. Estos precios actualmente deben ser mucho mas altos, considerando que el precio referencial, que es el del diesel 1, para la venta a las industrias es de S/1460/gal6n a partir del 3 de septiembre, en lugar del anterior de S/630, con lo que se ha ampliado mucho mas el diferencial de precio entre los dos productos y por consiguiente existe un mayor incentivo para desviarlo. Por otra parte, al ser el precio del diesel 1 considerablemente mas alto que el del kerex, aun antes del 3 de septiembre, se ha consolidado un mercado negro del producto, a traves del cual este Ilega a un precio mas bajo a las industrias, a la pesca artesanal y a otras actividades productivas. Existen evidencias de este fen6meno, asi, de acuerdo a la informaci6n obtenida en los centros de distribuci6n de las tres ferias libres de Quito, por ejemplo, las personas que acceden al combustible, adquieren tan solo un 45% del kerex disponible y que efectivamente es vendido en esos centros, con lo que se deduce que el remanente es desviado y vendido en sustituci6n del diesel 1 y diesel 2. Igualmente, al obtener promedios de consumo de kerex por hogar, relacionando las ventas de Petroecuador, con el numero de hogares que consumen este combustible, se encontr6 que apenas un 9% esta justificado en terminos de consumo residencial, pues mientras el numero de hogares que consumian el producto en 1990 represent6 solamente el 13% de 1982, el consumo de aquel anio fue un 40% del de 1982. Para 1990 se obtiene un promedio de consumo de kerex de 90 galones/mes/hogar, cifra que es exagerada, comparado con un promedio estimado de consumo real que no pasa de los 10 galones/mes/hogar. Annex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 109 De lo anterior se deduce que los beneficiarios del subsidio no son en general los consumidores de bajos ingresos sino los intermediarios, y los usuarios finales del kerex que lo adquieren mas barato que el diesel 1 (o diesel 2). Al momento actual se esta subsidiando dos productos sustitutos para uso dom6stico, el kerex y el GLP, lo que no es recomendable en terminos de una sana poiftica de precios, por lo que se recomienda reservar el kerex para el consumo de los grupos de bajos ingresos y con un precio relativo inferior al del GLP, el que debera alcanzar su valor econ6mico en el corto plazo. Por otra parte, se precisa reducir el margen entre el precio del kerex y el diesel 1. El nuevo precio del kerex podria encontrarse en el promedio que actualmente estan pagando en realidad los consumidores. La reducci6n del margen desestimularfa el acaparamiento y su venta a los sectores productivos. Paralelamente se debe liberalizar la comercializaci6n, de manera que se distribuya nuevamente en las gasolineras y se multipliquen los puestos de distribuci6n en las areas marginales de las ciudades y en el area rural, para desestimular el acaparamiento, permitiendo que el subsidio produzca un real beneficio social. En las areas rurales donde no ha penetrado completamente el GLP existen buenas posibilidades de ampliar la comercializaci6n de kerex, en sustituci6n de la paja y la lefia, reduciendo danios ecol6gicos y reduciendo los costos en tiempo que significa para el usuario la recolecci6n de este ultimo producto. No puede dejarse a un lado la aplicaci6n de polfticas sociales compensatorias, al mismo tiempo que se ejecute el incremento de precios del kerex, entre las que se encuentra el estimular la oferta de estufas eficientes de kerosene que ofrezcan mejores condiciones que las actuales y la aplicaci6n de otros programas de educaci6n, salud, capacitaci6n, empleo temporal, etc. PRECIO ACTUAL DEL KEREX: RESULTADOS RELEVANTES DE LA INVESTIGACION DE CAMPO EN LAS CIUDADES DE OUITO, GUAYAQUIL Y CUENCA La presente investigaci6n se realiz6 durante las primeros dfas de agosto de 1992, antes de la toma de medidas econ6micas decretadas por el actual Gobierno, el 3 de septiembre del mismo afno. Entre las medidas dictadas esta la relacionada con la elevaci6n del precio de los combustibles. Asi, los precios del diesel 1 y diesel 2 subieron de S/.630/gal6n a S/. 1460/gal6n, el del GLP de S/.80/kg. fue reajustado a S/.235/kg.; en tanto que el precio del kerex se congel6 en S/.60/gal6n, anunciandose su futura desaparici6n del mercado. Bajo los actuales precios, el diferencial entre el precio del kerex y su sustituto, el diesel 1, se ha ampliado sustancialmente, pues el precio del primero representa apenas el 4% del precio del segundo, lo que estarfa incentivando en mayor medida el desvfo del kerex con fines diferentes al del domestico, y al mismo tiempo asegurando mas elevados margenes de ganancia a los intermediarios que participan en la comercializaci6n del producto y a los consumidores finales, artesanos, industriales, pescadores, que lo compran a precios mas bajos que el diesel 1. Las primeras indagaciones realizadas para establecer los reales beneficiarios del subsidio al kerex en las ciudades de Quito, Guayaquil y Cuenca dieron lugar a m6ltiples inquietudes y 110 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution cuestionamientos que exigieron modificaciones en la estrategia de investigaci6n. En una primera instancia, aparecia como suficiente la investigaci6n de campo en los sitios de distribuci6n oficial del combustible, especialmente ferias libres, con el prop6sito de poder determinar el numero de usuarios, la cantidad demandada y el uso para el que seria destinado el kerex. Sin embargo, la experiencia demostr6 que los datos proporcionados eran s6lo parcialmente ciertos. Este hecho escondia un fen6meno subterraneo tan propio de los sectores marginados y/o informales que se han desarrollado prolificamente en anios recientes en el medio urbano del pais. Asi, las denuncias realizadas por varios de los consumidores, sumadas a la informaci6n proporcionada por autoridades responsables de la distribuci6n de kerex y transportistas conocedores del medio, exigieron un seguimiento de los compradores, cuesti6n que permiti6 establecer la presencia de grupos organizados de especuladores que desviaban el combustible a prop6sitos ajenos a los declarados en la entrevista. Este desvio se realizaba a vehiculos y/o sitios cercanos a los de distribuci6n en los que era entregado el k6rex a precios muy por encima del nivel fijado oficialmente. El consumidor final en las ciudades esta constituido, por familias de modestos ingresos y por pequenios industriales, pequefios empresarios y artesanos que en su afan por reducir costos, son abastecidos por un mercado negro del k6rex. El mecanismo utilizado consiste en un convenio entre especulador y grupos familiares de pequefios ingresos que son encargados de formar largas colas (frecuentemente por mas de 12 horas) para acceder al combustible. El convenio termina con la entrega del k6rex al especulador, comprado supuestamente para consumo del hogar. Este ultimo paga por gal6n una cantidad de aproximadamente tres veces el precio oficial y tiene establecido contactos con los consumidores arriba nombrados a los que se vendfa el kerex a un precio promedio no inferior a 250 sucres. Pero estos pequefios empresarios -- entre los que destacan los pescadores artesanales de la costa - -, no son los unicos destinatarios del kerex: la cadena se prolonga al abastecimiento de pequefios pueblos que circundan las ciudades que abastecen finalmente al medio rural, (para alumbrado) en donde el combustible es distribuido en botellas (generalmente de menos de un litro) por un precio de hasta 300 sucres/botella, aproximadamente 15 veces superior al oficial. CONSUMO DE KEREX EN LAS CIUDADES DE QUITO, GUAYAQUIL Y CUENCA La investigaci6n realizada ha permitido determinar la brusca caida -- al parecer definitiva -- del consumo de kerex a nivel nacional, debido fundamentalmente a cambios en los habitos de consumo de la poblaci6n (sustituci6n con GLP), debido a su bajo precio y al mayor confort que este producto ofrece. La informaci6n disponible no deja dudas al respecto: en 1988 el consumo nacional alcanzaba a 33.8 millones de galones, que se reduce a 16.2 millones en 1991. Las estadisticas mas recientes muestran que esa tendencia, se mantiene: la confrontaci6n del consumo del primer trimestre de 1992 en relaci6n al primer trimestre de 1991 indica una caida, a nivel nacional, del 39.5%. En las ciudades investigadas, Quito, Guayaquil y Cuenca, el consumo ha disminuido -- siempre comparando el primer semestre de 1992 respecto a su similar de 1991 --, en el 56, 47.5 y 24.7 por ciento respectivamente. Actualmente, el consumo en las tres ciudades es de aproximadamente 513 mil galones promedio/mes y representa el 62.3% del consumo nacional. (Annex Table 23). Sin ser definitiva, la explicaci6n al parecer radica en el Annex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 111 desvio del k6rex a actividades a las que no esta destinado, como el creciente consumo en la pequenia industria y la pesca artesanal, que lo utilizan como combustible alternativo al diesel 1, cuyo precio es sustancialmente superior al del k6rex. (Annex Table 24). DISTRIBUCION A NIVEL POPULAR El kerex es un combustible estrechamente vinculado al consumo de los sectores populares. En esta perspectiva, con el prop6sito de no afectar la economia de los hogares de menores ingresos, el k6rex mantiene altos niveles de subsidio gubernamental. Con la intenci6n de incentivar su consumo, el Gobierno anterior aplic6 un programa de distribuci6n en las liamadas \"ferias libres\", donde se supone acuden a realizar sus compras las familias de bajos ingresos. Paralelamente se elimin6 la distribuci6n en las gasolineras, con la finalidad de evitar el desvio a la industria, en sustituci6n del diesel 1. Sin embargo, estos objetivos no se estan cumpliendo, al contrario, se ha conformado un sistema de venta restringida que ha dado lugar al acaparamiento. En la ciudad de Quito, semanalmente se realizan tres ferias libres en los barrios Gatazo, Marin y La Ofelia. Con el prop6sito de investigar la distribuci6n de kerex a nivel popular y determinar si se esta cumpliendo el prop6sito social del subsidio al combustible, se destacaron grupos de investigadores a los tres sitios de distribuci6n, con los resultados que se observan en el Annex Table 25. De la informaci6n de este cuadro, se desprende que semanalmente se distribuyen, en los tres sitios, 6600 galones. Sin embargo, menos de 3000 galones (es decir un 45.4%) son distribuidos directamente a los aproximadamente 400 demandantes que acuden a los sitios de distribuci6n. Desagregando esta informaci6n puede destacarse que a la feria de Gatazo asisten para aprovisionarse de k6rex alrededor de 113 personas, 115 asisten a La Marin y 167 lo hacen a La Ofelia. Los volumenes de k6rex a los que tienen acceso estas personas (especialmente nifios) son 1068, 1136 y 791 galones respectivamente en las tres ferias libres, que representan el 48.5, el 47.3 y el 39.5% del total de combustible que se destina a los tres sitios indicados. Cuando las personas que acuden, formando largas colas, a proveerse de kerex son preguntadas sobre el uso que daran al combustible, se estima que aproximadamente el 69% responde que es para cocinar; el 12% lo destinara al alumbrado, el 7% lo utilizard para el calentamiento de agua para bafios. En porcentajes menores, el k6rex serd utilizado en la fabricaci6n de cera para pisos (4%), para el aseo directo de pisos (2%), en labores de fundici6n (4%) y en otras actividades el 2%. (Annex Table 25). En funci6n del volumen que se destina a cada uno de los usos descritos, se encuentra que el 31%, el 29% y el 18% se utiliza para \"cocina\", \"banos\" y fabricaci6n de cera, respectivamente. Las actividades restantes consumen volumenes menores (Annex Table 25). Respecto a los precios de venta a nivel de tanqueros en las ferias libres, se obtuvo un promedio de S/68/gal6n en las diferentes ciudades observadas. (Annex Table 26). Sin embargo, el precio promedio de consumidor final es de S/337/gal6n con un rango que fluctua entre S/250 y S/650/gal6n, dependiendo de la ciudad y distancia en que se ubica el consumidor final. 112 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution ASPECTOS RELEVANTES DE LA INVESTIGACION De acuerdo a la informaci6n obtenida en los centros de distribuci6n, las personas que directamente acceden al combustible adquieren menos de la mitad del k6rex disponible, vendido normalmente en las ferias libres. Hubo que preguntarse, entonces, sobre el destino del diferencial entre el volumen total de kerex destinado a la distribuci6n (6600 galones) y el adquirido por los consumidores (2995 galones). De entrevistas a funcionarios responsables y a personas conocedoras y ligadas al mercado del kerex, pudo establecerse la existencia de un mercado negro o mercado secundario que distribuye el k6rex a distintas actividades productivas que legalmente (al no ser destinatarias del subsidio) deberfan adquirir diesel 1 para sus actividades. Debido a denuncias recibidas y al comentario generalizado sobre el desvlo del producto, se hizo un seguimiento de algunos compradores. Como resultado de esta especie de \"pesquizaje\" pudo determinarse la veracidad de las denuncias presentadas, dandose casos -- los mas evidentes -- en los que a muy corta distancia de los sitios de distribuci6n se hallaban ubicados otros en los que era entregado gran parte del combustible adquirido, cuyo volumen es dificil de cuantificar por obvias razones. Esta realidad permite destacar los siguientes aspectos: El numero de beneficiarios directos contabilizados en las ferias libres es mas bien reducido y s6lo representa un pequefno porcentaje de las familias de bajos ingresos, incluso en relaci6n con las residentes en los barrios perifericos donde se realizan las ferias libres. Alrededor del 80 por ciento del combustible destinado a beneficiar a las familias de menores ingresos de la ciudad -- de acuerdo a las investigaciones realizadas -- es desviado a prop6sitos distintos a los originales. Las investigaciones han permitido detectar la presencia de grupos de personas - vinculadas al mercado secundario -que acuden a comprar kerex a los tres sitios de realizaci6n de las ferias libres en Quito, utilizando familiares -frecuentemente nifnos - para que les guarden puesto en las \"colas\". Las razones que explican este fen6meno son varias: Las \"colas\" se forman en los sitios de distribuci6n, la noche anterior al de las ferias libres, situaci6n a la que en general no estan dispuestas las familias que requieren semanalmente de 2 o 3 galones de kerex, quienes prefieren comprar el combustible a los revendedores, a un precio mas alto sin movilizarse, compensando asf el costo del transporte desde otro barrio o desde pueblos aledafios al sitio de distribucion, y el tiempo muerto de espera. La diferencia significativa de precios entre el k6rex y el diesel 1, y la venta en un reducido numero de sitios, ha dado paso a la conformaci6n de un mercado ilegal o secundario, en el que se revende kerex a precios que fluctuan entre 250 y 650 sucres el Annex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 113 gal6n (Annex Table 26) dependiendo del lugar de venta, de su distancia del lugar original de distribuci6n y del numero de intermediarios. La investigaci6n ha demostrado que la poblaci6n mas castigada por este fen6meno es la campesina, a la que Ilega el kerex a un precio aproximado de 500 sucres el gal6n y aun mayor en zonas distantes y aisladas. El mercado secundario al que se hace referencia, tiene como sustento a grupos bien organizados de especuladores que acaparan el kerex para su posterior venta al consumidor final, constituido por lo general por pequeiios industriales, familias que utilizan el k6rex como combustible y poblaci6n campesina para el alumbrado. Se ha podido establecer que quienes conforman las \"colas\" para la compra del kerex, aunque declaren que sera utilizado en fines domesticos, en realidad lo adquieren con prop6sitos especulativos. En forma paralela, ha sido posible detectar que actualmente, en la ciudad de Quito, son muy pocas familias -con tendencia decreciente -las que aun utilizan cocinas a kerex. Explican este criterio generalizado -- dado por la experiencia - -de que las cocinas a k6rex, a mas de las molestias que causan, tienen una durabilidad mucho menor que las cocinas a gas (G.L.P.); ademas el costo del k6rex en el mercado secundario es similar, para fines de cocci6n, al del gas licuado por lo que en la actualidad en forma generalizada se utiliza G.L.P.; la restringida comercializaci6n del k6rex desincentiva su uso. ESTIMACION DEL CONSUMO DE KEREX EN EL SECTOR DOMESTICO Si se analizan los datos correspondientes a las ventas de kerex registradas por PETROECUADOR, se nota una gran diferencia con las estimaciones del requerimiento de este combustible en el sector dom6stico del pais. En efecto, de acuerdo a los resultados de los Censos de Poblaci6n y Vivienda, en 1982 existian alrededor de 275 mil viviendas que utilizaban este combustible para la cocci6n de alimentos, habiendo disminuido esta cifra considerablemente para 1990, al registrarse un total nacional de aproximadamente 35 mil viviendas. Por su parte, las ventas de kerex al sector residencial en este mismo lapso, disminuyeron de 99.2 a 39.9 millones de galones, sin considerar las cifras correspondientes a las ventas a instituciones publicas. En terminos relativos, esto implica que mientras la cantidad de hogares que consumieron kerex en 1990 fue de tan s6lo el 13% del nuimero registrado en 1982, el volumen vendido de este combustible represent6 en 1990 el 40% del valor registrado en 1982 (Annex Tables 27 a 31), de lo que no puede deducirse que el consumo por familia ha aumentado para 1990, sino que mas bien se esta produciendo un desvio a otros sectores, pues resulta imposible que el consumo por hogar se haya incrementado en mas de 4 veces durante este periodo de analisis . Si se considera que el consumo especifico de kerex por habitante no supera los 2 galones/mes, en los hogares que utilizan este combustible (segun datos de encuestas realizadas en el sector), se estima que unicamente el 34.5% de las ventas realizadas en 1982 correspondieron a la demanda del sector residencial, con tamaino promedio de hogar de cinco miembros. 114 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution Para 1990 la situaci6n es mucho mas crftica, pues de acuerdo a los datos reales obtenidos, el consumo por vivienda serfa de 94 galones por mes (205 gal./mes en la zona norte y 81 gal./mes en la zona sur), es decir, mAs de 22 galones por habitante/mes. Con estas cifras, y si se considera el consumo estimado por habitante (2 gal./mes), resulta que durante este afio solamente el 9% de las ventas realizadas se destinaron al sector residencial. Durante 1991 y 1992 la situaci6n es similar. Las ventas de kerex en el sector domestico habrfan disminufdo en un 62% en 1991, respecto al afio anterior, ubicandose en alrededor de 15 millones de galones. La estimaci6n del numero de hogares demandados en este aino (27 mil viviendas, de acuerdo a la tendencia intercensal), indica un requerimiento total de 2.66 millones de galones, es decir, alrededor del 18% de las ventas contabilizadas. Si se relacionan las cifras de las ventas producidas en cada zona con el numero de hogares que consumen este combustible, los promedios de 1992 indican consumos mensuales de alrededor de 140 y 22 galones/vivienda, para los distritos norte y sur, respectivamente, lo cual representa consumos especificos de mas de 7.7 galones/habitante/mes. CONCLUSIONES OUE SE DESTACAN En la actualidad, las familias con pequefios recursos, en favor de quienes se mantiene en principio el subsidio del kerex, no se benefician -sino en muy corta medida -del bajo precio de ese combustible. En el mejor de los casos, el porcentaje de familias beneficiadas por el subsidio, no supera el 0.2% de los hogares quitefios y no es mayor al 1% de los hogares pobres de la ciudad. Esta realidad, con pocas diferencias, es similar en ei resto del pais. Si la investigaci6n es concluyente en el sentido de que quienes realmente se benefician del subsidio al kerex son los usuarios industriales de k6rex que lo compran mas barato que el diesel 1, ademas se beneficia a grupos bien organizados de especuladores y revendedores, que en el proceso de comercializaci6n en el mercado secundario obtienen utilidades. Por otra parte esta actividad se ha constituido tambien en una estrategia de superviviencia de los grupos de bajos ingresos que especulan con pequeiias cantidades del producto. Abandonando el ambito de las ciudades, se ha comprobado que un alto porcentaje de consumo de k6rex en la costa ecuatoriana, se orienta a la pesca artesanal, que lo utiliza como altemativa al diesel 1. Por la marcada tendencia a la caida del consumo de kerex y su sustituci6n generalizada por el G.L.P., a mds de las razones que se han anotado, es dificil pensar en un programa que se plantee la generalizaci6n del consumo de k6rex a nivel familiar en los barrios populares del medio urbano del pais, al menos en las circunstancias actuales de precio relativamente bajo del gas licuado. Parecerfa conveniente plantear una iniciativa similar que beneficie al medio rural ecuatoriano, en donde las pautas de consumo citadino agn no tienen arraigo, dado que un 57% de la distribuci6n se lo hace en comunidades del sector rural o a trav6s de 218 puestos de distribuci6n que representa el 57% del volumen distribufdo. Se necesita por tanto una mayor investigaci6n de lo que estA ocurriendo en el medio rural. (Annex Table 32). Annex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 115 Llama la atenci6n la irregularidad en la oferta de kerex en todas las ciudades, para junio de 1992 se habia proyectado una distribuci6n mensual de 538.000 galones a traves de las ferias libres, habiendose distribufdo solamente 125.847 galones, que representa solamente el 23% de esa oferta te6rica. (Annex Table 33). Para los hogares que auin consumen kerex en el medio urbano, su costo finalmente resulta mas oneroso, pues en el mejor de los casos -dadas las condiciones de distribuci6n - deben pagar por un gal6n de k6rex 400 sucres, costo similar o muy cercano al de gas licuado de petr6leo (5 galones de kerex significarfan 2000 sucres, en tanto que 15Kgr. de G.L.P. tiene un precio de s/1500 a domicilio) (a julio de 1992, aun mas alto al vigente en ese mes). ALGUNAS RECOMENDACIONES Es necesaria la elevaci6n inmediata del precio del k6rex, reduciendo asf el enorme diferencial existente con el diesel 1, a fin de ELIMINAR LAS RESTRICCIONES ACTUALES AL SISTEMA DE COMERCIALIZACION, HACIENDO ASf MAS DIFfCIL LA EXISTENCIA DE MONOPOLIOS PARA LA DISTRIBUCION. Debe existir suficiente numero de distribuidores ubicados adecuadamente de conformidad con la localizaci6n de la demanda. La distribuci6n deberfa volverse a las gasolineras, y en los lugares donde no existe el suficiente numero de surtidores debera autorizarse distribuidores privados, en condiciones que atiendan eficazmente la demanda. Esto ultimo sera generalmente aplicable en Areas marginales de las ciudades y en zonas rurales aisladas. Paralelamente al incremento de precio se deben implementar programas sociales compensatorios, como la oferta de estufas de kerex mas eficientes que las actuales y actividades tendientes a mejorar las condiciones de educaci6n, saneamiento, atenci6n primaria de salud, y pequenia infraestructura productiva a nivel local, apoyo a gesti6n microempresarial, microempleo, etc. A los pescadores artesanales se les deberfa compensar mediante proyectos tendientes a organizarse, a mejorar sus tecnicas de captura y procesamiento en tierra, asi como apoyarles en las fases de transporte y comercializaci6n. Sin embargo, por consideraciones sociales, el incremento del precio del kerex a nivel del diesel 1 no puede hacerse de inmediato, por lo que se propone que en primera instancia, el precio se eleve al nivel del promedio que actualmente estAn pagando en la realidad los consumidores, precio que refleja la voluntad de pagar de estos, dadas sus necesidades. Esto se debera hacer siempre y cuando se consiga la eliminacion de los actuales acaparadores. De lo contrario solamente se estaria garantizando margenes mas elevados para ellos. Por otra parte, es preciso considerar el precio del kerex, en el contexto de todos los precios de los energeticos, en particular el GLP que es uno de los sustitutos. Este se encuentra todavfa subsidiado por lo que en un futuro debera alcanzar su valor econ6mico. 116 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution Si el incremento del precio del GLP en las magnitudes anotadas se produce, implicitamente se estarfa reservando al kerex como un producto orientado a los consumos de los grupos de bajos ingresos y con un precio relativo inferior al de aquel; puesto que no conviene en terminos de una sana poiftica de precios de los energeticos, el subsidiar dos productos sustitutos como ocurre actualmente. Una forma de superar las distorsiones que se vienen comentando, serfa la de ampliar e intensificar la distribuci6n de kerex a las parroquias aledafias a las ciudades y al medio rural en las que existe una mayor demanda y mejores posibilidades de desarrollo de un mercado potencialmente significativo. De otra parte, un sistema de distribuci6n libre eliminaria el desarrollo de actividades especulativas, permitiendo que el subsidio cumpla su prop6sito de beneficio social. En los medios rural y campesino, en los que aun no se ha difundido el consumo de gas licuado y/o kerex, seria conveniente y provechoso la comercializaci6n del kerex como combustible alternativo y sustitutivo de la paja, la lefia y el carb6n, evitando mayores dafios ecol6gicos provocados por deforestaci6n. Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 117 DESCRIPCION DE LUGARES VISITADOS Quito En la ciudad de Quito se investig6 en las ferias libres de La Ofelia, Marian y La Gatazo, tambien se hizo una observaci6n en los puestos fijos de la Ermita y las Calles Bogota y Uruguay. Las personas consultadas, en las tres partes, manifestaron que su residencia la tienen en: San Roque, Turubamba, Hospital del Sur, Nanegal, La Tola, San Blas, Vicentina, Tejar, Monjas, Villa Flora, San Bartolo, La Marfn, San Recreo, Clader6n, Amaguafia, Puembo y San Jos6 de Minas. Esto nos demuestra que los demandantes son de los barrios perif6ricos y de las parroquias aledafias al Quito Metropolitano. El destino que le dan al kerex, es para cocina, piso, alumbrado, mecanica, tratamiento de la madera, calefacci6n bafios, industrializaci6n de la cera para pisos, etc. En estos puestos se detect6 que existe una cadena de intermediarios que estan bien organizados y se apoyan mutuamente para defenderse de futuros competidores o para obtener mayor cantidad del combustible, ellos lo revenden a intermediarios que lo receptan en camionetas a s/1 50 o s/250 el gal6n. Estos acaparadores distribuyen a su vez en algunas pequefias industrias y en los pueblos aledafios y los duefnos de tiendas pequenias a un precio que oscila entre 300 y 400 sucres. Los pequefios intermediarios (primeros) tienen que hacer cola desde el dia viernes a las 16 horas hasta las 10 horas del sabado en que se distribuye el kerex a sf70. En los puestos fijos por el contrario venden el kerex y el diesel 1 a los siguientes precios 630, 650 y 700 el gal6n, en estos lugares no existe aglomeraci6n ni agresi6n fisica, como sucede en las ferias libres. De los entrevistados, fue novedad el sistema que ha optado la directiva de una Comuna de San Jose de Minas. El presidente y el tesorero comprar generalmente 20 galones para distribuirlo a las familias de la comuna a un precio promedio de 200 sucres el gal6n. Estos sefiores sugirieron que el kerex en la zona rural deberia distribuirlo la Junta de Agua Potable, porque tienen experiencia en el manejo de dinero publico, esta medida contribuiria a los objetivos que se propone el Estado de beneficiar a los estratos pobres. Ellos confiesan tambien que las familias de ingresos medios y altos prefieren abastecerse de diesel 1 en vez de kerex. El destino que le dan al combustible es para alumbrado, cocina y motores. Cuando se les consult6 si estarian de acuerdo en que el kerex se expenda en las bombas el 90% se manifest6 positivamente. La capacidad de los tanqueros que acuden a estos lugares es de 800 galones, pero s6lo distribuyen las tres cuartas partes, la diferencia no pudieron explicar, se infiere que esa cantidad la venden a los especuladores. 118 Ecuador: Energy Pricing, Subsidies and Interfuel Substitution Guayaquil En la ciudad de Guayaquil se investig6 el sistema de distribuci6n de kerex en Pascuales, Francisco Jacome y el recinto denominado \"Tres Postes\". En Pascuales hay un dep6sito que expende permanentemente, mediante un convenio con Petrocomercial el distribuidor obtiene por concepto de arriendo del local la cantidad de S/60000 mensuales, mas adecuaciones del inmueble. En este lugar se ven de entre 450 y 550 galones a 300 personas en promedio por dia. (son compradores de todos los dias entre hermanos y madres de familia). Las personas entrevistadas manifiestan que el kerex lo utilizan en la cocina (67%), en tratamiento de la madera, (8%), en mecanicas, (5%), para desinfecci6n (6%), para quemar basura (7%), y para alumbrado (7%). De las 300 personas que hicieron cola el dia sabado 8 de agosto, el 46% son menores de edad (13 -16 afios), son quienes venden inmediatamente a uno de los intermediarios, o lo venden en el muelle a pequefias embarcaciones que se dedican a la pesca. Las personas mayores de edad protestan porque la medida del gal6n no es completa, de s/60.00. Este problema tambi6n lo comparten los choferes de los tanqueros que dicen que a ellos tambien les entregan menos en el lugar de abastecimiento. (Los tanqueros reciben de Petrocomercial medido por varilla). En Francisco Jacome, lugar importante de distribuci6n, el Sefior Mancero, Director del Programa de Distribuci6n del Kerex de Petrocomercial, en la provincia del Guayas, manifest6 \"en base a su experiencia, que calcula que aquf el 80% de los compradores son revendedores, razon por la que se vende racionado, maximo dos galones por persona\", en 6sta actividad de reventa participan por lo menos 30 familias, cuya responsabilidad esta a cargo de los ninios y las mujeres. En el Recinto \"Los Tres Postes\", hay un lugar de expendio controlado por Petrocomercial, previo convenio con un representante de la poblaci6n quien esta encargado de distribuir a las poblaciones rurales pero estos dfas no esta operando, porque los responsables manifiestan que el programa esta paralizado hasta que el nuevo gobierno tome nuevas decisiones. En lugares aledafios 5 kil6metros de este lugar expenden en tiendas 6 cobachas pequefnas a s/400 el litro, cuyos habitantes lo utilizan para alumbrado, quemar basura o como desinfectante. En Guayas existen 63 convenios para distribuci6n en el sector rural. En cada poblaci6n existe un responsable quien generalmente es un lider de la parroquia o resinto, o quien ha trabajado por algdn candidato ganador. Generalmente el responsable de distribuci6n se convierte en el major acaparador del combustible para beneficio personal en reventa. Cuenca En la ciudad de Cuenca, se visit6 la Feria del Arenal, la feria de Tatoracocha, el Sector de la Carcel, San Sebastfan y Banios de Cuenca, los resultados no fueron tan halagadores por la fecha especial de cambio de gobierno, que esta incidiendo en estos dias -en un cambio diametral de los precios, fluctuando entre 400 y 600 sucres el gal6n de kerex. Esta actitud ha inclinado a los demandantes urbanos a consumir diesel 1 que lo expenden a s/650.00 en cantidad suficiente y Annex 5: Investigacion Sobre El Precio Del Kerex 119 sin atropellos en la bomba del Mercado 9 de Octubre. Algunas de las personas consultadas, manifiestan que serfa loable que se distribuya el kerex en el campo en mayor volumen, y en las ciudades se debe incrementar los puestos de distribuci6n en los barrios populares, pero no estan de acuerdo en que se venda en las bombas de gasolina, porque adulteran otros productos (debido al elevado diferencial entre el k6rex y los demds productos). En la ciudad de Cuenca, al igual que en Quito y Guayaquil, hay familias que se han dedicado desde hace tres afios aproximadamente a esta actividad de reventa del kerex. Hay dos modalidades de distribuci6n, la una en las ferias libres y la otra en puestos fijos. En las ferias libres se realizan el viemes, ese dia los revendedores compran a s/60 el gal6n y de lunes a jueves compran en los puestos fijos a s/70; para ello tienen que acudir a las 3 horas a ganar tumo (les ponen numeros en el antebrazo derecho) para proveerse de cuatro galones, para revenderlos a los \"camioneteros\" a 150 a 200 sucres. Esta transacci6n les genera una utilidad de aproximadamente 36.000 sucres que significa el 61% del Salario Minimo Vital (SMV). Los \"caminoneteros\", como los conocen, entregan el kerex a s/400 en mecanicas, lugares que dan tratamiento a la madera, planteles avicolas, tiendas pequefias y rurales. Esto puede ser una explicaci6n del descenso de la demanda de Diesel 1, en la industria, en donde tambi6n existen cupos para distribuci6n por parte de Petrocomercial a este sector. Los demandantes potenciales son los indigenas que utilizan en la cocina y alumbrado. Las personas consultadas en la zona periferica de Cuenca atestiguan que el gal6n de kerex se vende a 400 y 500 sucres el gal6n, y en lugares mas alejados a un precio mayor. En las ferias, los tenderos condicionan la venta del kerex, es factible siempre y cuando compren otros productos fundamentales como la sal, arroz, azucar, manteca y jab6n. Para estos tenderos la botella de kerex (litro) es parte de la canasta basica. Otras ciudades Bajo otras modalidades, se investig6 el precio de venta del kerex en las ferias libres y en puestos de distribuci6n fijos, en las ciudades de Ibarra, Latacunga, Cayambe, Balsapamba, Bolivar, en las cuales se comprueba que la tendencia de la distorsi6n del precio del kerex que existen especuladores y que el precio promedio del kerex es de s/364, es decir, mas de seis veces el precio of July.
