The aim of Functional Yoga Medicine is to integrate the best practices of Eastern and Western Medicine to provide you with a complete and holistic approach to your healing so that you can effectively get rid of unwanted symptoms. Hormones are chemical messengers in the body that communicate with one another and command our organs and body systems to function. But our hormones are heavily influenced by our energy or state of being. When something feels off, Western Medicine doctors can test our hormones, but they typically only test and address singular hormones, then prescribe medication for one hormone. Not to mention, these lab results can change dramatically at any moment, depending on our state of being. But here's the truth: because all our hormones it's not effective to address just ONE hormone. So how can we address and balance all hormones in the body? By balancing our chakra system. Chakras, a foundational pillar of Eastern Medicine philosophy, are vortexes of energy in the body that correspond and influence specific glands and hormones. Unless we address our state of being and balance the energy of our chakras, our hormones stand no chance at achieving balance. In this episode, you'll discover: How our ENERGY influences our body function, and why Western Medicine labs can be unreliable as a result The faulty and production The 7 chakras in the body, the hormones they are associated with, and the impact of chakra imbalance on our hormones How to use Yoga and meditation as a tool for balancing chakras so that you can naturally balance hormones to get rid of unwanted symptoms Want to get your hormones.
