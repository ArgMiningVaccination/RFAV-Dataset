H\u00f6fte (2004) of rice and causes high yield losses in most rice growing regions every year. Blast is an endemic disease in all Iranian and Uruguayan rice fields, with yield losses up to 90 % that has been reported from some rice growing regions. Various types of blast infection can be observed in a field, including symptoms on leaves, collar, neck, panicle, and grain. Although the fungus is only known to reproduce asexually in nature, it is infamous for its diversity. P. oryzae is not only pathogenic on rice, but also on other cultivated and wild gramineous hosts. is considered to consist affecting genetic structure of some of main rice growing countries, such as of the pathogen. Diversity can be a taxa bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, AFLP markers have emerged as a major type of genetic markers with broad spectrum of application, especially in structure. Also, the more the probability of making a mistake by chance factors (ref. 20 of my Paper). is to genetic variability 55 P. oryzae isolates from Iran and (PCO), based on AFLP data from 679 monomorphic and polymorphic bands generated with eight primer the isolates revealed separate a total of 87 isolates. Within each AFLP group, two or more haplotypes were detected with a genetic similarity of 100 %. Overall genetic similarity was greater than 50 % between Iranian and Uruguayan populations. Little evidence for gene flow between the two populations of the pathogen. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) revealed that rice varietal factors determining genetic structure of "}
