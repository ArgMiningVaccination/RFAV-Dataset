This study was out of mice divided to four groups. Case group received 600 (treatment I) and 1200 (treatment II) mg/kg/day extract of Mentha piperita normal saline during GD6-GD15 by gavages and other control did any matter during 6-15 of there was no significant difference between treatments and controls groups. In the treatment I (600 mg/kg/day) and treatment II (1200 mg/kg/day), normal saline and control group, no world population currently rely on traditional medicines and most of plant extracts (Zhang, 2002).Recent reports a wide use of bypregnant women (Hepner et al., 2002). Mentha piperita is a herb, which is commonly, used in folk medicine, in Iran, turkey, India, the Middle East,Europe and Canada for of leave extract and of M. piperita vary with plant maturity, geographical regionand processing conditions (Ruiz Del Castillo et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2003). Previous studies have shown antiviral, antibacterial and anti piperita (Minami et al., 2003; Schuhmacher et al., 2003; Choi et al., 2003; Azuma et al., 2003; Duarte et al., 2005; Tampieri et al., 2005). Also, Inoue et al. (2002) and Satsu et al. (2004) reported anti allergic effects al., al., 2003; Micklefield et al., 2003). Also Tate et al. (1997) reported anti nausea effect of this herb. Some studies reported of M. dyspepsia (Madisch 2001; R\u00f6sch et al., (Kline et 2001). *Professor, Gorgan Congenital Malformations Center, Department of Anatomical Sciences, Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran. **Department of Anatomical sciences, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.***Faculty of Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.****Assistant Professor, Department of Anatomical Sciences, Babol University reported the histophatological effect in animal model (Thorup et al., 1983; Spindler & Madsen, 1992). It was that the piperita has a shown that tea has antiandrogenic both animals and females(Adkogan et al., 2007; G\u00fcney et al., 2006) and anti spermatogenic activity in rodents (Adkogan et al., 2004; Sampaio, 2004). the other hand some researches showed chemoprotective, antimutagenic 2003; Samman et al., 1998). In to the use of Mentha piperita for preventing vomiting and morning sickness in pregnantwomen studies and setting The study was performed in 2008 at the Faculty of Medicine, Gorgan University of Medical Sciences.Approval for this study was gained from the Animal Careand Ethics Committee of the of material. Mentha piperita were stove then using hydroalcoholic 48 the resulting 40C\u00ba make thin layer chromatography and purity tests (foreign matter,total ash, insoluble analysis, monosaccharide-linked another (spectrophotometry) concentration of polysaccharides in Mentha piperita leaves for standardization of the extract. At the time of administration, the prepared po wder of the extract was solved the and the mice were treatedwith the solution.The animals used in this study were experimental, 28-30 gram week old virgin female andmature Balb/c The males were breeding stock with confirmed mating experience.Dry food pellets house maintained at a male of thesame strain overnight. The presence of vaginal confirmed that mating had taken (Gestation Day0: GD 0). that did not excluded from the study. Pregnant mice were into the two experimental 1200 mg/ kg/day of Mentha piperita extract) and the two control groups. 12 mice in the two experimental groups received 600 to GD 15, by intubation. Theother control group did not normal horn, ovarian left uterine horn. either alive or Blue changes were recorded in any group. The treatedfemales consumed as much food and water as of maternal toxicity due to Mentha piperita treatment. No signs of toxicity were noted in any of the animals. All pregnant animals appeared healthyat sacrifice. The weight of fetuses in treatment I (1.29 \u00b1 0.02) and treatment II (1.37 \u00b1 0.02) were lower than controls (p<0.05)(Table 1). Also BPD in the treatment I group(7.15\u00b10.12) and treatment II group (7.05 \u00b10.05) was not significantly and of fetuses in the left horn (55%) of uterine of the treatment group was higher than theright horn (45%). While in the control group this percentwas similar, 48% in the right and 52% in the left uterinehorn. Major congenital malformations in fetuses were notfound in and control groups. Alizarin red S andAlcian blue staining did not show delayed bone in treated groups DISCUSSION The findings study showed that piperita study has a cytotoxic effect that M. piperita to Smart method has a cytotoxic effect. (1987) cytotoxic effect of Mentha piperita can be related to high level of pulegone which is a toxic substance or menthol.Furthermore in a study, Akdogan et al. antispermatogenic effect in rats. In the literature we did not find any article about teratogenic effect of this plant. In our study we did not ob-serve any this herb may be due in intracellularor DAN of cells. Also the different effects of M. piperita in different studies can be due to various chemical componentsof leave or oil extract of M. piperita depend on plant maturity, species, geographical region and processingconditions (Ruiz del Castillo et al.; Xu et al.) In this study, the fetuses of the treatment group had decreasing weight. The decreasing weight of fetus in treated experimen- groups may be due to the blocking of cell growth whichmay be due to weight cellular fetus.because up al., 2008; 1999). The growth of the fetus during intrauterine life is reflected in the weight at Fetal growth is largelydetermined by the authors appreciate the Department of Research Gorgan University of Medical de Mentha piperita L . durante Mentha piperita (Labiatae), com\u00fanmente conocida como menta, es una hierba nativa de Ir\u00e1n, que se utiliza en la medicina tradicional para diversos fines. Este estudio fue realizado para descubrir el efecto teratog\u00e9nico de la Mentha piperita en fetos de ratones. Los ratones Balb/c pre\u00f1adas fueron divididas en cuatro grupos. Los grupos recibieron 600 (tratamiento I) y 12 00 (tratamiento II) mg/kg/d\u00eda del extracto hidroalcoh\u00f3lico de Mentha piperita durante los d\u00edas 6-15 de gestaci\u00f3n (DG), mientras que un grupo control recibi\u00f3 soluci\u00f3n salina normal durante los DG 6-15 v\u00eda oral y otro grupo control sano no recibi\u00f3 substancia duran te los DG 6-15. Los ratones fueron sacrificados el DG 18, recolectando los fetos. Se realiz\u00f3 la observaci\u00f3n macrosc\u00f3pica mediante un estereomicroscopio. 20 fetos de cada grupo se ti\u00f1eron por el m\u00e9todo de rojo de alizarina-S y azul de Alci\u00e1n. La media de peso d e los fetos disminuy\u00f3 m\u00e1s en los grupos de tratamientos que los controles (p <0,05), pero CRL no present\u00f3 diferencias significativas entre los tratamientos y los grupos control. En los fetos del grupos tratamiento I (600 mg/kg/d\u00eda), tratamiento II (1200 mg/kg/d\u00eda), solu- ci\u00f3n salina normal y control no se observ\u00f3 ninguna malformaci\u00f3n cong\u00e9nita grave. Los fetos tratados tampoco tuvieron osificaci\u00f3 n \u00f3sea retrasada seg\u00fan lo determinado por el m\u00e9todo de rojo de alizarina-S y azul de Alci\u00e1n. Este estudio mostr\u00f3 que el extracto hidroalcoh\u00f3lico de Mentha piperita (600 y 1200 mg/kg/d\u00eda) no tiene efectos teratog\u00e9nicos en fetos de ratones al ser utilizado continuamente durante el per\u00edodo embrionario.
