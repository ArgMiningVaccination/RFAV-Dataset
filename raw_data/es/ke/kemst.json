There are new lines of research that are investigating the link between hyponatraemia and patient falls.Aim To determine if hyponatraemia fallen during their hospitalisation at Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Hospital (Madrid) were considered cases. Patients who did not fall were considered to be controls, paired according to the following variables: hospital ward, age, length of hospital stay, gender and Downton fall risk index. The sample size was 206 subjects.Data collection Socio-demographic factors, variables included in the falls record sheet, Downton fall risk index and considered determine the sample homogeneity. The OR was calculated, and an were performed.Results Of 103 cases recruited, 61 were men (50.4%) and 42 were women (49.4%). Hyponatraemia was detected in 29 cases with an association with falls of P: 0.002. The adjusted OR was 3.708 (1.6-8.3), 95% CI. Risk factors for were hyponatraemia and limb sensory deficits.Conclusions Given that hyponatraemia could be considered a risk factor for falls, the inclusion of the determination of sodium level would be fall prevention in the elderly. La hiponatremia es el trastorno electrol\u00edtico m\u00e1s frecuente. Algunos estudios afirman que aumenta la morbimortalidad. Existen nuevas l\u00edneas de investigaci\u00f3n que buscan la relaci\u00f3n entre hiponatremia y ca\u00eddas.Objetivo Determinar si la hiponatremia es un factor relacionado con las ca\u00eddas en ancianos hospitalizados.M\u00e9todo Dise\u00f1o observacional anal\u00edtico de casos y controles.Poblaci\u00f3n de estudio Se consideraron casos los pacientes mayores de 65 a\u00f1os que experimentaron una ca\u00edda durante su ingreso en unidades de hospitalizaci\u00f3n del Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n de Madrid.

The WHO defines a fall as the consequence of an involuntary event resulting in the person coming inadvertently to Falling is one of the risks patients have during their hospital stay. Even when falls do not cause injury, they may have a negative effect in elderly adults: restricting their physical activity and increasing the risk of another fall. [2](#bib0095) Twenty-seven per cent (27%) of adults over the age of 65 fall once a year and 15% fall more than once a year. [3](#bib0100) Falls are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in people over the age of 65. [1,4-7](#bib0090) There is evidence that 3.7% of hospitalised patients in Spain experience a fall, [8](#bib0125) extrinsic factors are involved in its [9](#bib0130) In a controlled hospital environment, accidental falls attributable to an extrinsic factor are much less common than forms strategy in the care of hospitalised patients. [8](#bib0125) As there are multiple, predisposing physical risk factors for falls, it is essential to evaluate the risk of patients who have a fall to thus ensure that all the possible factors risk to The scale used most often is the Downton does include it should be important independent risk falls. [5,6,14](#bib0110) Therefore, it must be determined whether hyponatraemia may be a risk factor to be systematically assessed and included in fall prevention protocols. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine whether hyponatraemia is a risk factor for falls in the hospitalised population over the age of 65.Material and methodsType of design Observational, case-control, analytical study. The study period from 1 April 2013 to 14 December 2013.Study scope This study was carried out at the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n of Madrid [Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n General University Hospital] at and female patients over the age of 65 who were hospitalised at the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n in Madrid, in the units mentioned above, who agreed to consent. definition: patients hospitalised at one of the study units, over 65 years of age and who experienced a fall during their hospital stay. Control definition: for case-control we selected a patient hospitalised in the same unit and during the same time period who had not fallen, and who was paired in terms of age, gender us a with a high risk of falling when their score was 3 obtained preliminary losses. Sample size of cases and controls. The following information was obtained for both the patients and the control subjects: levels at the time of the fall or in the most recent analytical test conducted before the fall; for we recorded the serum sodium level closest to the time they were included in the study and their modified Downton index score. - Data from the centre's fall registry file: date of admission, previous falls, information on referral, limitations in mobility medication, safety devices required. - For the cases of fall, the following variables were also considered: date and time of fall, whether they were alone, consequences, activity, environmental, safety and therapeutic devices at the time of the fall. This study was approved by the Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n of Madrid Independent Ethics Committee.Data collection When a fall occurred, it was reported to a team member and, after obtaining informed consent, all the study variables were collected. In parallel, a control subject was recruited who had given prior consent, and the same information was recorded for the control subject except for the information regarding the environment, circumstances and consequences of the fall.Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was carried out using the Access and SPSS V.21 for Windows computer programmes (IBM1 Corporation, New values <135mmol/l. descriptive statistical analysis variables was carried out, with frequencies and percentages in the case of variables. Frequencies were compared with the Chi-squared test in the case of qualitative variables and with the Student's t-test for quantitative considered statistically significant. To quantify the magnitude of the association between the different variables studied, the results are presented with their odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A bivariate to be model those variables that presented higher p-values, and calculating the the factors included.Results During the study occurred. [Table 1](#tbl0005) describes the sociodemographic and clinical variables of the groups of cases and controls, and shows that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to these variables, so the groups were homogenous. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of the case group and controls. Analysis of homogeneity between [Table 2](#tbl0010) shows that more than half of the falls had no consequences and only one resulted in a wound that needed to be sutured. The rest of the environmental characteristics and the time of the fall suggest that the greatest number of falls occurred in the patient's room, when he or she was walking around and the most typical safety devices were in place. Characteristics of the fall and environment where it occurred. |n (%)| |The patient was alone analysis. [Table 3](#tbl0015) shows the values of the factors that did not have statistical significance, and [Table 4](#tbl0020) shows those that did obtain a significant relationship and were subsequently included in the regression model. Variables in which no significant differences were found between the two groups and hospital 95% confidence intervals of the variables in which an association was found with falls between the two groups. |Cases n data had been analysed with the logistic regression model and any possible confounding factors had been removed, we found an association falls and the confidence intervals of the variables in which an association was found with falls between the two groups. |Variables||Sig.||Raw OR||95.0% CI for this study we found an association between hyponatraemia and falls. We also showed the relationship between falls and sensory impairment in the extremities. This it can be concluded that hyponatraemia is a risk factor for that are assessed using the Downton fall risk index, but they are not identified as symptoms of a disease requiring early treatment, to be symptoms related to patient's age and physical status that lead to the application of restrictive measures and adapting the environment to prevent falls. Additionally, considered asymptomatic factors presented are to a state of hyponatraemia or other reasons. Until 2006, only one study had investigated the association between falls and the presence of hyponatraemia. [5,6,15](#bib0110) In recent years, studies have emerged demonstrating that hyponatraemia is an important independent risk factor for falls and is related to fractures. [5,6,16](#bib0110) directly impact falls. In Spain, approximately 30% of people over the age of 65 fall once a year, and, of these, 50% fall again in the same year. [2,3](#bib0095) Given this high prevalence and considering that falls common in institutionalised elderly patients, [2](#bib0095) the conclusions of this study take on special clinical relevance: there are great repercussions in the safety of the most vulnerable patients, as falls are an important source of comorbidity and deterioration in and environmental situations been described in the literature which are predisposing factors for falls and can be modified, such as the intake of some drugs, hospitalised risk should be evaluated and underlying factors susceptible to change should be approached. According to the Pharmacovigilance centre of the Community of Madrid, since the year 1992 there has been a 70% increase in the cases of hyponatraemia attributable to drugs, and half of these cases occurred in patients over the age of 75. The did not find a direct relationship between taking drugs and falls. and importance implementing guarantee patient safety fall [8,17](#bib0125) To this end, effective tools must be created assess the risks factors for falls in hospitalised patients. In view of the above, and as a result of the data provided by this study, we believe that hyponatraemia is a risk factor for falls and serum sodium should be determined and included in the falls risk assessment scales, and be part of the fall prevention strategies the elderly.
