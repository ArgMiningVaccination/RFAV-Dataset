ABSTRACT - Acupuncture is practiced worldwide despite the difficulties in reconciling its principle with evidence-based medicine. Nowadays there are several studies and approaches which explain skin condition. There is a genetic predisposition and it is considered the second most common cause of pruritus in dogs. Despite the great diversity of control immunotherapy other treatment method is able to change course with low risk of secondary effects, requiring life-long maintenance. However, its efficacy in the treatment of human Atopic Dermatitis is controversial and it's contraindicated in the treatment of Atopic-Like Dermatitis. Despite there being as of yet no studies specifically tailored for CAD several studies have demonstrated its efficacy in human Atopic indicates it might be a safe complementary therapy for CAD. An 11-week study was elaborated in order to ascertain the tolerance of acupuncture by dogs with cutaneous hypersensitivity and, simultaneously, the clinical evolution of Canine when using acupuncture as a complementary treatment. Despite a small sample, two clinical cases only, the study revealed some improvement in terms of pruritus and the need for further studies in companion animals with a bigger sample, control group, a blind study model and a longer treatment period so the efficacy of acupuncture can be accurately evaluated. The tolerance study in dogs characterises is very well This seems to indicate that in subjects with skin the treatment tolerance will be even higher. Peixoto, Ana Catarina Andrade. dist\u00e2ncia entre e estruturas often severe or fatal and proved that despite being an old technique it may not be a safe one. The references to the knowledge of anatomy needed to practice acupuncture rarely refer the individual variability of the anatomy or of the limit values that can be seen in a population. The same applies to the distances that are essential to know in order to practice acupuncture safely, namely the distance elapsing from the skin surface puncture points to the vital structures of the body. Aim: To assess the variability of the distance from the skin surface to the vital organ which is closer to it, in the most commonly used acupuncture points of the posterior chest wall. Methodology: We carried out an observational study with a sample of 100 individuals, whose ages ranged from 20 to 69 years old. All of the individuals underwent a computed tomography (CT) da The sample selection was carried out at random. Individuals were grouped by age into five groups of twenty patients. We evaluated the distance from the skin surface to the parietal pleura in 7 points of acupuncture, the meridian of was a predominance of females (n=54/100). In most cases, the vital organ closer was the lung. As far as the average is concerned, the lowest value was found at Point 46 of the bladder meridian on the right, 28.58 mm. Regarding individual values, the shortest value observed in an individual case was 11.74 mm in the same acupuncture point. The maximal distance observed from the skin surface to the pleura was 100.43 mm in point 41 of the right bladder. In the group of the 20 to 29 year olds, we found the lowest average distance from the skin surface to the pleura with 24.11 mm, which corresponds to point 46, bladder left. There was a trend to increase the average distance from the skin surface to the pleura with age. Conclusion: We conclude that there is a clinically relevant variability in the distance between the skin surface and the pleura in posterior thoracic acupuncture points. Even though there are described some techniques to avoid a pneumothorax, this study shows that in some cases the distance may be very small, reaching less than 12 mm.

Methods: We studied a block randomized sample of 60 individuals between 70 and 99 on clinical grounds have undergone computorized Seven acupoints were from the bladder meridian according to its clinical relevance: Point 13, 16, 18, 20, 41, 46 and 49. Results: Our sample included 24 women and 36 men from 70 to 97 years, with an average age of 83 + 8 years. The acupoint that includes the measurement with the smallest distance in millimeters from the skin surface to pleura is Point 46 of the Bladder Meridian (11.25 mm) - female patient with 94 years old. On average, the smallest distances were observed in points 46 and 49 both left and right sides, with median values that According the Kruskal-Wallis test, the difference in the safety distance in the three age groups was statistically significant (p <0.05) at acupoint 16 left side (p = 0.044), 46 left (p = 0.006) and right side (p = 0.007) and 49 left (p = 0.015) and right side (p = 0.039). The lowest median value in the age group 90-99 years was found in point 49 right side (21.85 mm). Discussion: Data from our study confirms that the distance between the skin and vital structures in the acupuncture points of the chest wall, may be a few millimeters. The tiny values found in patients from 90 to 99 years old reflects the changes inherent in the stature and loss and usually a decrease muscle is an ancient technique which originated from the region of the People's Republic of China, based on the principle of balance of Vital Energy (Qi) and Blood (Xue) that circulates in the body. According to the philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, the flow of Qi and Xue is dependent on the state organs and in the interaction between humans and nature. This balance is restored through puncturing using needles, and through the burning of Artemis vulgaris (commonly used plant) in acupunctural points, by which the Qi flows. The technique has aroused the interest of scientists who threshold of in pregnant women. Acupuncture is nowadays being increasingly used in the induction of labor problems associated with drug therapy, causing a reduction in average labour time (which ranges from 10 to 29 hours), in psychological tension at birth, in the number of failures in the process of labour induction (16.6%), in the necessity to instrumentalize the childbirth (14%), the risk of uterine hyperstimulation and in the increased speed of cervical maturation. An increased use of the acupunctural technique can lead to an increase in the number of vaginal deliveries, greater satisfaction of the mother and reduced costs related to childbirth. Studies to date suggest that the use of acupuncture for labor induction is practically harmless and stimulate uterine acupunctural points used in BL67 This method is limited to situations where the fetus has an abnormal position and presentation, and in other certain medical conditions. This dissertation intends to present a literature review on the influence of acupuncture for the induction of labor, reflecting the potential of this process, as well medicinas complementares e alternativas (MCA). A acupunctura constitui uma das muitas MCA e no contexto nacional aguarda a sua regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o conforme prevista na Lei n\u00ba 45/2003 - Lei do Enquadramento Base das Terap\u00eauticas N\u00e3o Convencionais.
