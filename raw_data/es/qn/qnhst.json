The active ingredients of plant extracts are chemicals that are similar to those in purified medications, and they have the same potential to is commonly used in the traditional medicinal systems in Sri Lanka. The mature rhizomes are branched and dense with a light to dark brown color (Jayaweera, 1982). Kong and co -workers (2000; 2002) have calcarata China. roots and leaves. Further, 1, 8 - cineol was found to be the major constitue nt in the oils of rhizomes and leaves while in the roots, it was fenchyl acetate. A. calcarata rhizomes are known to possess spectrum of medicinal properties. In Sri Lankan Traditional Ayurveda medicine, rhizomes of A. calcarata is recommended s an aphrodisiac and a decoction g of rhizomes in dried form is introduced into a clay pot and gently boiled in 1920 mL of water for about 3 h and the final volume reduced to 240 mL using a low flame. The dosage recommended for administ ration to an adult is a half a cup (120 mL) two times per day. Experimentally, A. calcarata rhizomes of Sri Lankan origin of A. calcarata rhizomes to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether hot water extract (HWE) and hot ethanolic A. calcarata rhizomes have any toxic effects in rats. MATERIAL S AND METHODS Plant material Fresh A. calcarata rhizomes were collected from home gardens in Western Province of Sri Lanka between the period of August - November. The plant material was identified and authenticated by the curator of National Herbarium, Ro yal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. A voucher specimen (AS 01) was deposited in the Industrial Technology Institute, Colombo 7, Sri Lanka. Preparation of the hot water extract (HWE) Fresh A. calcarata rhizomes were cut into small pieces and air dried for 5 -6 days in the shade. Five hundred grams of dried rhizomes were boiled with 2.5 L of distilled water (DW) for 4 h. The hot water extract was concentrated under vacuum at 60 \u00ba C and -dried use. the hot ethanolic extract (HEE) Fresh A. calcarata rhizomes were cut into small pieces and air dried for 5 -6 days in the shade. Five hundred grams of powdered rhizomes extraction apparatus for 4 the filtrate was evaporated to in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka Boletin Latinoamericano y del Caribe de Plantas Medicinales y Arom\u00e1ticas/ 437 12 h of natural light per day, relative humidity 50 - 55%) and fed with standard rat and water ad libitum. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the internationally accepted laboratory animal use and care and guide lines and rules of the Faculty of Science, University of Colombo, for animal experimentation. Experimental design Thirty six male rats were weighed 4 equal groups (n = 9/group). The rats in group 1 were orally treated with 1500 mg/kg of HWE in 1 mL of DW while the rats in group 2 orally treated with 1 mL of DW (served as the control group 1). Rats in group 3 were orally treated with 1500 mg/kg of HEE while the rats in group 4 orally treated with 150 0 mg/kg of PVP in 1 mL of DW (served as the control group 2) for 42 consecutive days between 10.00 h - 11.00 h. In our previous investigations we have used doses ranging from 100 - 1000 mg/kg from HWE and HEE of A. calcarata to investigate antinociceptive 2009b) Therefore, in the present study, tested dose level is 2 to 6 fol d higher than that have been used in Rats were checked twice daily (9.00 h and of toxicity (salivation, diarrhoea, lacrymation, intake determined weekly during the period of treatment for each group. The consistency of faeces and color of noted func tions On day 1 post treatment, approximately 4 mL blood was collected from the tail of the treated rats anesthesia To one part ethylenediamine tetra -acetic acid (EDTA) was added and red c ounts, white (Ghai, 1993). Other part was allowed to clot (25 - 30 min.) at room temperature (28 - 30\u00ba C) and subjected to 15 min centrifugation at 3200 rpm for the collection of serum. Finally, day pos t treatment rats were sacrificed with over dose of the organs histopathology. These pieces were between a slide and cover slip for microscope.

DISCUSSION Nature has provided a complete storehouse of remedies to cure ailments of Medicinal any drug depends not only on its therapeutic efficacy but also on its lack of toxicity or adverse side effects. In the present study, A. calcarata extracts devoid unacceptable administra toxicity, of faeces of HWE and HEE treated rats were similar to that of controls. The results obtaine d for hematological parameters, HWE treated rats remained similar to that of respective control groups. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the presence of certain liver enzym es in the blood. The most sensitive widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferase which include ALT. These enzymes are normally found within liver cells. If the liver is injured, the liver cells spill the enzymes into blood which in turn r aises the enzyme levels in the blood and signals the liver damage (Champe and Harvey, 1994). As Compared to the respective control groups, the concentrations of ALT and AST were normal in the treated groups. Therefore, A. calcarata extracts were devoid Salvi verticillata (Eidi et al., 2011 ) may cause liver damage leading to hepatocellular carcinoma.

On the other hand, urea is the major end product of protein nitrogen metabolism. The determination of renal or nitrogen with decreased levels (Champe and Harvey, 1994). In this study, the crea tinine and urea parameters were normal compared to that of respective controls. Therefore, indicated of renotoxicity. An was both extracts significantly weight of the spleen, This is novel and important the plant. Similar results have reported with A. galanga (Bendjeddou et al ., 2003) a close relative plant of A. calcarata and also with Withania somnifera (Davis and Kuttan, 2000) which is used in the indigenous system of In contrast, administration methanolic extract the weights o f spleen (Malathi and Gomez, 2008). It is generally accepted that the active principles (whether natural or synthesized) may be more toxic than the whole extract crude crude preparations, the other components that ar e present in addition to the active components may be influencing the effects of the active components as well as the other toxic components in the preparation (Koul et al., usually demonstrate adverse ef fects. This may be the reason for the safety of A. calcarata extracts indicated in this study. In conclusion, A. calcarata HWE and HEE were found to be safe in terms of hepatotoxicity (as judged by AST, ALT renotoxicity judged urea aversive behaviors which is 2 to 6 fold higher than that have been used in investigation of biological act ivities.
