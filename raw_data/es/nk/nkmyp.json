This narrative review covers the past fifty years and focuses on herbal preparations of Ayurvedic, Traditional Chinese, and Kamp Medicines that have the potential to reduce or eliminate the harmful effects of radiation. Our findings highlight ten herbal preparations, namely Abana, Amalakyadi Churna, Amritaprasham, Brahma, Bu-zhong-yi-qi-tang (BZYQT), Chyavanaprasha, Cystone, Geriforte, Mentat, and Triphala, which have demonstrated potential radioprotective effects. This review examines their composition, properties, and possible mechanisms of action in relation to their radioprotective properties. Exploring the ethnobotany of traditional Asian medicine is particularly interesting as it may lead to the discovery of new active compounds with radioprotective properties.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-17", "cleaned_text": "Informaci\u00f3n del item - Informaci\u00f3 de l'item - Item information de investigaci\u00f3n o GITE: ||Grupo Balmis de Investigaci\u00f3n en Historia de la Ciencia, Cuidados en Salud y Alimentaci\u00f3n (BALMIS)| |Centro, Departamento o Servicio: ||Universidad de Alicante.
