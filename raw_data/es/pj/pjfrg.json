Abstract Background roots of Pueraria lobata and Scutellaria baicalensis, herbal medicines with a long of widespread have been traditionally prescribed toxicological data on these herbs and their combination are This study orally at a single of 5000 In subchronic toxicity study, HT047 was administered orally at repeated daily doses of 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks, followed by a 4-week recovery period. Results In the acute study, no subchronic toxicity study, HT047 caused no resulted from the pharmacological effects of P. lobata and in and female rats. The oral no-observed-adverse-effect level of HT047 greater than 5000 mg/kg/day in rats of both sexes, and no target organs were identified. The present findings support the safety of an herbal extract of P. lobata and S. baicalensis as a therapeutic agent for stroke and further confirm the safety of the combined use of P. lobata and S. baicalensis in clinical practice. Background Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability and death worldwide, yet with intravenous only U.S. approved pharmacologic treatment but only 3-5% of patients receive this multiple to adverse reactions [ [2](#CR2)]. More than priority for new drug development for stroke. In East Asia including China and Korea, traditional medicine has been historically used treat stroke, and and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi have a long history of use in the treatment of stroke [ [7](#CR7)]. P. lobata is a perennial vine belonging to the family Leguminosae, and its roots rich in such as puerarin, and known as Chinese skullcap, is a flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae various flavonoids including most frequently used herbal medicines in China and Korea [ [9](#CR9)]. These two herbs have been traditionally developed HT047, an herbal extract consisting of the roots of rats sensorimotor in (data these findings, we decided to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate efficacy ischemic [ [13](#CR13)]. Although P. S. baicalensis have a long history of widespread use, limited information is available regarding their toxicity in humans and animals. A few studies on general toxicity of each of two herbs have conducted in studies of P. lobata S. to our knowledge, have only been conducted in combination with other herbs [ [18](#CR18)- [21](#CR21)] and in these cases the administration doses were not high enough to ensure the clinical safety of each herb and HT047. Also, in the subchronic toxicity study of Keyler et al. (2002) [ [18](#CR18)], the toxicity of an herbal mixture containing P. of the widespread combined use in clinical practice. There is a misconception that herbal medicines are safe as they are natural and have been used since a long time, but they can cause significant adverse effects [ heart injuries induced by the major active compounds of S. baicalensis administered at of HT047 in essential to its safety as a therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke prior to progressing to a clinical research. In the present study, acute and subchronic oral toxicity tests toxicity and to the approximate lethal (ALD, were conducted in compliance with the test guidelines of the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). Methods Preparation of test extract of the dried of P. lobata and baicalensis. HT047 was produced by Bioland Co., (Osong, Bulk Good Manufacturing Practice certified manufacturer. The dried roots of lobata and were authenticated by Professor Hocheol Kim of Kyung Hee University and mixed together in an 8.0:1.1 weight ratio. Voucher specimens of the authenticated raw materials were deposited in the Herbarium of Kyung Hee University College of Korean Medicine (No. 13070301 and 13070302). The mixed roots were extracted twice with 10 times (v/w) the amount of 30% (v/v) ethanol in distilled water for 3 h at 70 \u00b0C. The liquid extract was filtered, concentrated under 60 plants were deposited in the Department of Herbal Pharmacology, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University (HP028 a Waters instrument (MA, USA) equipped with a Waters 1525 pump, Waters 2707 autosampler, and Waters 2998 photodiode array detector. The m Waters). The phase consisted of 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid in distilled water (A) and acetonitrile (B). gradient profile was as follows: 0-60-61-63-68 min, 5-50-70-5-5% solvent B. The injection volume was 10 L and the flow rate was maintained at 1.0 mL/min. The detection was monitored subchronic toxicity studies. Animals were allowed free access to food (2918C, Harlan Laboratories, Inc., USA) and water and acclimated to housing conditions for 1 week prior to the experiments. Animals were housed under the following controlled conditions: 22 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C, 50 \u00b1 20% humidity, and a 12 h light-dark cycle. Study design overview All experiments were conducted at Biotoxtech Co., Ltd., Korea in compliance with good laboratory practices. The acute toxicity study was conducted in compliance with the test of the Korean MFDS (No. 2013-121). The subchronic toxicity study was conducted in compliance with the test guidelines of the Korean MFDS (No. 2013-121) and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD TG 408). This study was approved by the animal experiment committee of Biotoxtech Co., Ltd., Korea (Approval No. 130495 and 140014) on the basis of the Animal Protection Act of Korea. Acute oral toxicity study A total of twenty 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the control or HT047 groups (n = 10; 5 males and 5 females per group). HT047 was administered by oral gavage at a single dose of 5000 mg/kg in a volume of 10 mL/kg body weight. The control group received the vehicle (sterile water for injection; Choongwae Pharma Corp., Korea) in the same regimen. Clinical signs were observed for 14 days, and body weight was measured on the day of administration and 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after administration (Fig. [1](/pmc/articles/PMC7368675/figure/Fig1/)a). Thereafter, all animals were euthanized by exsanguination through the under and were necropsied. Thirteen-week subchronic oral toxicity study One day before treatment, of one hundred 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four main groups (n = 20, 10 males and 10 females per group) and two recovery groups (n = 10, 5 males and 5 females per group). The four main groups were the control, low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose groups (0, 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day, respectively), and the two recovery groups were the control and high-dose groups (0 and 5000 mg/kg/day, respectively). The recovery groups were included to investigate of possible effects of HT047. HT047 was daily in a volume of 10 mL/kg body weight by oral gavage and the control groups the vehicle (sterile water for injection; Choongwae Pharma Corp., repeated dose toxicity study is recommended the trial and thus a 13 weeks was chosen. All rats received 13-week treatment and the rats in the recovery groups underwent 4 weeks of treatment-free observation period after the dosing period (Fig. [(Fig.11](/pmc/articles/PMC7368675/figure/Fig1/)b). According to the ICH guideline, a dose of 2000 is suggested for the dose for repeated-dose toxicity study. However, a rat dose mg/kg/day not provide a 10-fold a have a sufficient margin safety. Therefore, of 5000 mg/kg/day chosen as the highest dose in this study. Clinical signs All animals were checked once daily for clinical signs and twice daily for moribund and mortality during the study period. Body weight The animals were weighed immediately before dosing on the first day of treatment (defined as Day 1), once a week thereafter, and on the day before necropsy. Body weight measured on the day of necropsy assessment because the toxicity studies, 1-day food consumption between the time of group assignment and the start of treatment was measured. During the treatment and recovery periods, the mean daily food consumption was calculated as average of 7-day food consumption. At the 13th week of treatment and 4th week of recovery, the mean daily food consumption was Ophthalmologic examination was performed on all animals in the main groups during the 13th week of treatment and in the recovery groups during the 4th week of recovery. Pupillary light reflex and anterior segment were observed Urinalysis Urinalysis was performed on all animals in the main groups during the 13th week of treatment and in the recovery groups during the 4th week of recovery. Freshly voided urine indicators were measured using necropsy, all the animals were fasted for at least 18 h. On the day of necropsy, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood samples collected via the abdominal aorta. For hematology examination, approximately 1 mL of was 2 mL of tube containing 3.2% sodium citrate centrifuged 3000 rpm to obtain plasma. Prothrombin time and samples centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the serum.

Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., USA). For comparing two variances, the Folded F For comparing multiple variances, the to determine homoscedasticity. Data with valid homoscedasticity was analyzed and Kruskal-Wallis test, and further analyzed with the Steel's multiple test. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Results HPLC HT047 shows standard mixture (A) and HT047 used for this study (B and C). The baicalin contents established specifications. When HT047 was administered at a dose of mg/kg in the acute toxicity study, the dose equivalents of puerarin and baicalin 431 and 178 respectively. In the subchronic toxicity study, the dose equivalents of puerarin in the 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day groups were 79, 199, and 497 mg/kg/day, respectively, and those of baicalin were 35, 88, and 220 mg/kg/day, respectively. Acute oral in HT047 and mucous stool was observed in 3 out of 5 males treated with 5000 mg/kg HT047.

Test substance-colored stool were observed in: 2-9 males on day 2-48, 8-10 males since day 49, 3-9 females on days 2-57, and all females since day 58 in the 800 mg/kg/day group; 7-10 males on days 2-28, all males since 29, 7-9 females on days 2-20, and 9-10 females since day 21 in the 2000 mg/kg/day group; and 14 males on day 2, all males since day 3, and all females since day 2 in the 5000 mg/kg/day group. During the recovery period, test substance-colored stool was observed up to the 2nd day of recovery in male and female rats of the 5000 mg/kg/day group. These considered as toxic changes. Salivation was observed females it observed on the 87th day in 1 and 3 males in the 800 and 5000 mg/kg/day groups, respectively. On the contrary, mg/kg/day showed sporadic chromaturia starting from day 23. These observations were due to urine being colored by the test substance and were not considered toxicologically relevant. A mass was observed in the left shoulder and left lumbar region of a female in the 2000 mg/kg/day group, starting from the 49th days. Histopathological examination confirmed the mass to be considered observed formation right hindlimb due to toenail damage (1 male in the 2000 mg/kg/day group), soiled perineal region (1 male and 2 females in the 5000 mg/kg/day group), and loss of fur (3 females in the 5000 mg/kg/day group). These clinical signs were not considered treatment-related, because they appeared transiently or only in 1 or 3 animals.

Loss of hair from the skin was observed in 2/10 females of the 5000 mg/kg/day group. A black focal in the glandular stomach was observed in 1/10 females of the 800 mg/kg/day group. Mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the back and left inguinal area were observed in 1/10 females of the 2000 mg/kg/day group. In the recovery groups, 2/5 males of the control group showed abnormal findings, including diverticulum of jejunum in the glandular stomach (1/5). Hair loss was observed in 1/5 females of the 5000 mg/kg/day recovery group. findings mg/kg/day group and the severity was graded minimal in one females and mild The subcutaneous area and lumbar spine of one female of the 2000 mg/kg/day group confirmed to be gland adenocarcinoma. This considered change unrelated to the treatment, because it occurred only in a single case in the medium-dose group. All other findings were Sprague-Dawley at present study was conducted to evaluate the potential of the acute oral toxicity study, HT047 at a dose of 5000 mg/kg did not cause any mortality or treatment-related effects on clinical signs, body weight, and necropsy. Under the experimental conditions of this study, the oral ALD of HT047 was found to be greater than 5000 mg/kg in male and female rats. In the subchronic oral toxicity study, HT047 at doses of 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day caused no death and the body weight gain by 16% in males at a dose of 800 mg/kg/day (not significant) and by 30, 31, and 35% in females at dose of 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day, respectively (all p < 0.01). These changes were not dose-dependent and considered to be due to the reduction in fat accumulation by P. lobata and S. baicalensis [26](#CR26), cholesterol level by 36, 44, and 67% in males at doses of 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day, respectively, and by 45, 48, and 48% in females at doses of 800, 2000, and 5000 mg/kg/day, respectively. The change in total cholesterol level was considered to be due to the cholesterol-lowering effects of P. lobata and S. baicalensis [ [26](#CR26), which are attributed baicalin [ [28](#CR28)- [31](#CR31)]. Thus, it was determined that the change in total cholesterol level was of no toxicological significance. The other biochemical response to increased all of these treatment-related our a recent study increase in serum ALT and AST levels and necrosis after administration of P. lobata mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks in female mice, suggesting that the main compound puerarin may be for this effect [ [23](#CR23)]. However, P. lobata puerarin administration of P. lobata extract 12 weeks did not affect ALT and in human subjects the major compound of S. baicalensis, has been reported to induce kidney injury and fibrosis in rats at high doses per os); yet highest in study approximately is lower than the reported toxic dose [ [24](#CR24)]. Under the experimental conditions of this study, the oral NOAEL of HT047 was found to be greater than 5000 mg/kg/day in rats of both sexes. Limited data are available on the potential toxicity of P. lobata, S. baicalensis, and their combination. Chang et al. reported that single oral administration of the polysaccharide fraction of P. lobata at doses of up to 5000 mg/kg did not cause any toxicological changes in male and female rats [ [16](#CR16)]. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) and ALD of P. lobata and S. baicalensis water extracts were both greater than mg/kg in Seong et al. [ [15](#CR15)] and Lee et al. [ [17](#CR17)] a dose of 2000 mg/kg was set as the highest dose according to the guidelines of the Korean MFDS and OECD. However, a rat dose of 2000 mg/kg does not provide a 10-fold safety of thus chosen for this acute toxicity Our results of P. lobata, baicalensis, and their combination. The single and repeated administration of HT047 did not cause any toxic effects in rats at doses of up to 5000 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 22 times the proposed dose in clinical trial. Thus, it HT047 has a sufficient safety margin. Conclusions In conclusion, the oral ALD and NOAEL of HT047 were > 5000 mg/kg and > 5000 mg/kg/day, respectively, in rats, and no target organs were identified. The present study supports the safety of HT047 as an agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke and further confirms the safety of the clinical of P. animal data.
