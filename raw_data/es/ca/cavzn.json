Estimados integrantes de la comunidad de investigaci\u00f3n biom\u00e9dica. Es para m\u00ed un enorme placer darles la bienvenida a nuestra LXVI Reuni\u00f3n Anual que este a\u00f1o se realiza en forma conjunta con la Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda (SAI), la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Farmacolog\u00eda Experimental (AAFE) y la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Nanomedicinas (NANOMED). Como es tradici\u00f3n y como creo que corresponde, quisiera comenzar estas palabras realizando los agradeci - mientos pertinentes. Las actividades realizadas por la Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica (SAIC) a lo largo del a\u00f1o y la organizaci\u00f3n de un congreso como este, ser\u00edan imposibles sin un verdadero trabajo en equipo. En este sentido quiero destacar y agradecer el trabajo de la Comisi\u00f3n y del Consejo Directivo. No puedo dejar de manifestar mi reconocimiento a algunas personas en particular. Al Dr. Alejandro Urtreger que ha desarrollado una enorme tarea de organizaci\u00f3n a lo largo del a\u00f1o en gene - ral y para nuestra reuni\u00f3n anual en particular. A las Dras. Mariana Maccioni, Hebe Duran y Paula Schaiquevich, presidentas respectivamente de SAI, Nanomed y AAFE, por la c\u00e1lida relaci\u00f3n y el buen trato con los que trabajamos en la organizaci\u00f3n de esta Reuni\u00f3n Conjunta. Vaya para ellas y sus respectivas comisiones directivas todo mi agradecimiento. A los integrantes del grupo G2 y a nuestra secretaria Ivana por todo el trabajo realizado y por soportar con paciencia y buen humor mis cientos de llamados, emails y mensajes. A la Dra. Cristina Carrillo, presidenta 2020 de la SAIC, por haberme dado lugar para participar ampliamente en todas las actividades de la SAIC durante su mandato, lo que me permiti\u00f3 adquirir experiencia en la dif\u00edcil organizaci\u00f3n de la Sociedad en un a\u00f1o tan at\u00edpico. Esta experiencia fue una ayuda invalorable para la or - ganizaci\u00f3n de la reuni\u00f3n anual de este a\u00f1o en la que, contra todo pron\u00f3stico, tambi\u00e9n tuvimos que trabajar con las muchas limitaciones impuestas por la pandemia. Al Dr. Daniel Alonso, actual vicepresidente de SAIC, por ser una fuente permanente de consulta, intercambio de opiniones y consejos. Con Cristina y Daniel hemos coincidido en que SAIC debe tener funciones que van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la orga - nizaci\u00f3n de la reuni\u00f3n anual. Pensamos que nuestra Sociedad debe comprometerse con los temas del pa\u00eds que le ata\u00f1en y en los que pensamos que puede realizar un aporte \u00fatil e importante. En este sentido, comenzando con la presidencia de Cristina y continuando este a\u00f1o, hemos hecho p\u00fablico documentos que tuvieron como \u00fanico objetivo brindarle a la sociedad una visi\u00f3n cient\u00edfica sobre los temas relacionados con la vacunaci\u00f3n y el manejo de la pandemia ante la sorprendente difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n incorrecta que en muchos casos induc\u00eda en la poblaci\u00f3n temor y resistencia a la vacunaci\u00f3n. Este a\u00f1o la SAIC se ha incorpo - rado al \"Foro de Sociedades Cient\u00edficas, Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil y Universidades\" y en conjunto con las muchas organizaciones que constituyen este foro, tambi\u00e9n hemos emitido varios documentos en el mismo sentido y con el mismo objetivo. Creemos que la enorme difusi\u00f3n de estos documentos, as\u00ed como la alta repercusi\u00f3n que tuvieron, demuestra que es un aporte necesario e importante que SAIC puede realizar. La SAIC fue creada en 1960 por el Dr. Alfredo Lanari en conjunto con otros prestigiosos investigadores, con el objetivo principal de contribuir al desarrollo de la investigaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica y aplicada y a la difusi\u00f3n del cono - cimiento cient\u00edfico en el \u00e1mbito de la biomedicina. En un principio, su contenido cient\u00edfico era principalmente fisiol\u00f3gico y cl\u00ednico, de all\u00ed el nombre de Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica. Sin embargo, con el paso del tiempo y con el desarrollo del conocimiento cient\u00edfico fue incorporando diversas tem\u00e1ticas incluyen - do los mecanismos celulares, moleculares y gen\u00f3micos que contribuyen al desarrollo de las diversas patolo - g\u00edas. Por esta raz\u00f3n, la mayor\u00eda de los integrantes de SAIC actualmente investigamos en lo que podr\u00edamos denominar investigaci\u00f3n biom\u00e9dica b\u00e1sica. Pensamos que, sin descuidar esta importante orientaci\u00f3n en la que tanto se ha destacado la comunidad cient\u00edfica de nuestros socios, tambi\u00e9n debemos hacer un esfuerzo para tender un puente entre estas investigaciones y su aplicaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1mbito cl\u00ednico. En este sentido, el a\u00f1o pasado se instituy\u00f3 el premio Prof. Dr. Horacio A. Repetto en el \u00e1rea de enfermedades infecciosas pe - di\u00e1tricas. Este a\u00f1o hemos mantenido la organizaci\u00f3n de este premio tratando de incentivar la participaci\u00f3n de investigadores cl\u00ednicos en este \u00e1rea y hemos establecido un convenio de colaboraci\u00f3n rec\u00edproca con la Sociedad Argentina de Pediatr\u00eda. Debo agradecer en este punto la colaboraci\u00f3n de las Dras. Cristina Ibarra y Mar\u00eda Marta Amaral. Tambi\u00e9n hemos iniciado conversaciones con la Sociedad Argentina de Patolog\u00eda para establecer un convenio similar. Como se puede observar en el programa de esta reuni\u00f3n anual, muchas conferencias y simposios fueron organizados teniendo presente este objetivo, como por ejemplo la confe - rencia inaugural \"Immune therapeutic a cargo del premio nobel PhD James P. Allison y los simposios \"Translational preclinical, clinical and healthcare approaches\" organizados con la colaboraci\u00f3n de la Dra. Laura Bover y el Dr. Daniel Alonso, respectivamente. Sin duda la pandemia nos ha causado mucho dolor y sufrimiento pero tambi\u00e9n ha tenido un costado favo - rable para la ciencia. En primer lugar ha demostrado algo que ya sab\u00edamos y que la historia nos demuestra pero que una parte de la sociedad muchas veces parece olvidar y es que las soluciones a los grandes pro - blemas de la humanidad no pueden prescindir de los conocimientos cient\u00edficos. Mucho se repite que el desarrollo social y econ\u00f3mico de un pa\u00eds depende del desarrollo cient\u00edfico y tecno - l\u00f3gico del mismo. Sin embargo, a veces tengo la sensaci\u00f3n que muchos investigadores de nuestro pa\u00eds no tienen la \u00edntima convicci\u00f3n que esto sea verdad. Siempre me sorprendi\u00f3, cuando en a\u00f1os anteriores el gobierno de turno decidi\u00f3 incrementar el n\u00famero de investigadores y becarios del CONICET y fomentar el retorno de los que estaban fuera del pa\u00eds, escuchar a mucho colegas decir que ese incremento era dema - siado, que era \"un lujo\" que un pa\u00eds como el nuestro no pod\u00eda darse. Esto es m\u00e1s sorprendente si pensamos que muchos de los investigadores hemos tenido la oportunidad de trabajar en otros pa\u00edses y hemos visto que los mismos tienen una mayor cantidad de investigadores en relaci\u00f3n a la poblaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3micamente activa (PEA) y que sin duda de esto y de la inversi\u00f3n en ciencia y tecnolog\u00eda depende el desarrollo que han alcanzado. Es oportuno citar aqu\u00ed las palabras de uno de nuestros premios Nobel, el Dr. Bernardo Houssay: \"La disyuntiva es clara, o bien se cultiva la ciencia y la investigaci\u00f3n y el pa\u00eds es pr\u00f3spero y adelanta, o bien no se la practica debidamente y el pa\u00eds se estanca y retrocede. Los pa\u00edses ricos lo son porque dedican dinero al desarrollo cient\u00edfico-tecnol\u00f3gico y los pa\u00edses pobres lo siguen siendo si no lo hacen. La ciencia no es cara, cara es la ignorancia\" Si no estamos convencidos nosotros mismos de la relevancia de lo que hacemos para el desarrollo de nues - tro pa\u00eds, dif\u00edcilmente podremos convencer al resto de la sociedad y a la dirigencia pol\u00edtica de la importancia de apoyar e invertir en ciencia y tecnolog\u00eda. Es en este sentido que creo que la pandemia ha sido positiva, pues la sociedad ha visto c\u00f3mo numerosos grupos de investigaci\u00f3n de \u00e1reas como la biomedicina y las ciencias sociales de nuestro pa\u00eds r\u00e1pidamente aplicaron sus conocimientos al tratamiento y control de la Covid-19 con notables resultados. Tambi\u00e9n se ha demostrado que los investigadores, y como dec\u00eda m\u00e1s arriba las sociedades cient\u00edficas, tienen un important\u00edsimo rol en la difusi\u00f3n del conocimiento cient\u00edfico hacia el resto de la sociedad, especial - mente cuando surgen informaciones falaces y anticient\u00edficas como las que lamentablemente han circulado durante el transcurso de la pandemia. Creo que esta es la senda en la que, como comunidad cient\u00edfica, debemos perseverar y en este sentido deseo destacar enf\u00e1ticamente, porque seg\u00fan mi parecer no ha sido suficientemente difundida y valorada en toda su importancia, la reciente sanci\u00f3n por unanimidad en ambas c\u00e1maras del Poder Legislativo (el 24 de febrero del 2021 fue votada en el Senado) de la \"Ley de Financiamiento del Sistema Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n\" que hab\u00eda sido presentada originalmente en el a\u00f1o 2015. Dicha ley plantea incre - mentar el presupuesto para el \u00e1rea desde el 0.28% del PBI actual hasta el 1% del PBI en el 2032. Cabe destacar que la ley tambi\u00e9n indica que si un a\u00f1o el PBI disminuye, no se puede destinar menos presupuesto que el a\u00f1o anterior.La alternancia hist\u00f3rica de dos modelos econ\u00f3micos contrapuestos, uno de desarrollo industrial y tecno - l\u00f3gico con exportaci\u00f3n de productos con valor agregado y otro de producci\u00f3n y exportaci\u00f3n de productos primarios, ha hecho que el apoyo al sector cient\u00edfico y tecnol\u00f3gico en nuestro pa\u00eds tenga avances en el primer caso y retrocesos en el segundo. La aprobaci\u00f3n de esta ley y su votaci\u00f3n por unanimidad en ambas c\u00e1maras parecer\u00eda indicar que el apoyo a la ciencia ser\u00e1 de ahora en m\u00e1s una pol\u00edtica de estado. Sin em - bargo, tambi\u00e9n es cierto que en el pasado reciente leyes votadas con amplios consensos luego no fueron aplicadas o fueron derogadas. Depender\u00e1 en parte de que la comunidad cient\u00edfica y los organismos que nos representan, como es el caso de nuestra querida SAIC, hagan escuchar su voz fuerte y clara para exigir el total cumplimiento de esta ley. Las autoridades de las cuatro sociedades cient\u00edficas que organizan esta reuni\u00f3n anual hemos esperado hasta el \u00faltimo momento para ver si pod\u00edamos realizarla aunque sea en forma parcialmente presencial, lo que finalmente no fue posible. No obstante hemos hecho un enorme esfuerzo y hemos dado lo mejor de nosotros para vencer las dificultades y limitaciones que nos impuso la pandemia. Esperamos que a pesar de estas dificultades hayamos logrado organizar una reuni\u00f3n que les sea de provecho y especialmente que contribuya a la formaci\u00f3n de nuestros j\u00f3venes investigadores. \u00a1Ojal\u00e1 que sea de su agrado y la disfruten!Discurso de la Dra. Mariana Maccioni, Presidenta SAI. Estimadas y estimados miembros de las sociedades hoy reunidas, colegas, amigas y amigos: En nombre de la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva de la Sociedad Argentina de Inmunolog\u00eda les doy la bienvenida a nuestra Reuni\u00f3n Anual n\u00famero 69, que se realizar\u00e1 en conjunto con la Sociedad Argentina de Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Farmacolog\u00eda Experimental y la Sociedad Argentina de Nanomedicinas. Ha sido muy grato compartir con las autoridades de estas sociedades el desaf\u00edo de organizar este evento virtual, en un clima de cordialidad, en donde las desaveniencias se resolvieron con afabilidad y compren - si\u00f3n. Mis m\u00e1s sinceros agradecimientos a todos ellos. Si bien sabemos que la virtualidad no reemplaza en absoluto el encuentro presencial, el abrazo entre cole - gas tan a\u00f1orado, esperamos que en estos tres d\u00edas y medio interactuemos, se promuevan nuevas colabo - raciones y se generen discusiones enriquecedoras en un entorno amigable. La organizaci\u00f3n de este Congreso se llev\u00f3 a cabo en un a\u00f1o te\u00f1ido por la desaz\u00f3n de una pandemia que reci\u00e9n comienza a apaciguarse y en el que la Ciencia en general y la Inmunolog\u00eda en particular consolida - ron su rol protag\u00f3nico inesperado, erigi\u00e9ndose como la dosis de esperanza requerida para atravesarlo. Un a\u00f1o que nos encontr\u00f3 con la experiencia acumulada durante el 2020 en cuanto al uso y la potencialidad de las plataformas virtuales, a las cuales nos propusimos sacarles el m\u00e1ximo provecho. Un a\u00f1o en el que los cient\u00edficos y cient\u00edficas continuamos alejados de nuestras actividades habituales, procurando atender los problemas inmediatos que nuestras respectivas comunidades demandaban y en el que tuvimos que apren - der a comunicar y a divulgar novedades cient\u00edficas sumamente cambiantes. Un a\u00f1o en el que la aparici\u00f3n de las vacunas puso a la Inmunolog\u00eda bajo la lupa de toda la sociedad. Justamente, por este contexto, en donde la salud y la ciencia fueron prioridad, el Gobierno Nacional declar\u00f3 el a\u00f1o 2021 como el a\u00f1o de homenaje al premio Nobel de Medicina C\u00e9sar Milstein, no solamente porque su legado configur\u00f3 un hito en la historia de la medicina, influyendo en la inmunolog\u00eda, la oncolog\u00eda, la bio - tecnolog\u00eda y la industria, sino porque C\u00e9sar Milstein representa el modelo de cient\u00edfico apasionado por el conocimiento b\u00e1sico, pero comprometido con la realidad, capaz de vislumbrar que la curiosidad, y por ende el quehacer cient\u00edfico, son una fuente de desarrollo, riqueza y soberan\u00eda para los pueblos. En sus propias palabras \"la ciencia y la investigaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica son como una pieza de cristal, hermosa, he - cha por un gran artista, pero de cristal. En cualquier momento, por un mal movimiento, a veces queriendo hacerlo y a veces sin darse cuenta, esa pieza de cristal se rompe y se pierden a\u00f1os y a\u00f1os de trabajo y de preparaci\u00f3n...\". Una frase pronunciada hace m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os que tiene m\u00e1s vigencia que nunca. Es por ello, que celebramos la sanci\u00f3n de la tan anhelada Ley de Financiamiento del Sistema Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnolog\u00eda e Innovaci\u00f3n, en la que se declara de inter\u00e9s nacional el establecer un \"incremento progresivo y sostenido del presupuesto nacional\" destinado al \u00e1rea \"por su capacidad estrat\u00e9gica para el desarrollo econ\u00f3mico, social y ambiental\". Esperamos sinceramente que su implementaci\u00f3n no est\u00e9 atada a los vaivenes ideol\u00f3gicos de turno y que se transforme realmente en una pol\u00edtica de Estado a largo plazo. Uno de los desaf\u00edos que esta norma propone es la de lograr la federalizaci\u00f3n del sistema cient\u00edfico, una deuda pendiente que implica \"la producci\u00f3n, difusi\u00f3n y apropiaci\u00f3n del conocimiento cient\u00edfico y tecnol\u00f3gi - co en todo el territorio nacional, priorizando las zonas geogr\u00e1ficas de menor desarrollo relativo\". Los que trabajamos y vivimos en el interior sabemos de las enormes dificultades e inequidades existentes que se magnifican cuanto m\u00e1s lejos de Buenos Aires nos encontremos, desaprovechando as\u00ed un enorme poten - cial de desarrollo para nuestro pa\u00eds. Muchas veces, a igualdad de talento y esfuerzo, los resultados son significativamente m\u00e1s pobres en el interior, ya que los procedimientos burocr\u00e1ticos se complejizan, incre - mentando costos y tiempos. Si realmente se entiende el potencial estrat\u00e9gico del desarrollo de una ciencia de calidad en el interior del pa\u00eds para el progreso nacional, se requiere de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas, nacionales y tambi\u00e9n provinciales coordinadas que, por citar s\u00f3lo un ejemplo, alivianen el impacto de los gastos de env\u00edo y transporte que deben afrontarse con subsidios de montos similares otorgados a investigadores alojados a lo largo y ancho de nuestro pa\u00eds. Adem\u00e1s, a pesar de los esfuerzos que se realizan, siguen existiendo fallas en el flujo comunicacional que invisibilizan el trabajo, en muchos casos altamente promisorio, de los grupos de investigaci\u00f3n del interior. Mucho se ha avanzado, pero a\u00fan nos queda un largo camino por recorrer, para resolver un problema que tiene tantos a\u00f1os como la ciencia argentina misma. La pandemia tambi\u00e9n abri\u00f3 nuevas oportunidades de participaci\u00f3n y permiti\u00f3 que muchos de nuestros miembros, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n nuestra recientemente creada Comisi\u00f3n Covid-19, a cuyos integrantes agra - dezco profundamente, se convirtieran en actores cruciales de esta coyuntura hist\u00f3rica, asesorando a la Subsecretaria de Estrategias Sanitarias del Ministerio de Salud de la Naci\u00f3n, a la Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00eda e Informaci\u00f3n Estrat\u00e9gica, y a la Defensor\u00eda del P\u00fablico de Servicios de Comunicaci\u00f3n Audio - visual. Agradecemos a los encargados de las diferentes reparticiones nacionales su confianza en nuestra Sociedad y esperamos que este nuevo v\u00ednculo con otras reparticiones p\u00fablicas, no asociadas tradicional - mente a la ciencia, se consolide y robustezca en el futuro. Desde la Comisi\u00f3n Directiva trabajamos intensamente para estar a la altura de las circunstancias, esta - bleciendo un cronograma de actividades virtuales mensuales que tuvieron como objetivo la formaci\u00f3n y actualizaci\u00f3n permanente de nuestros socios, no s\u00f3lo en los temas que cl\u00e1sicamente han sido el foco de estudio de nuestra Sociedad, sino que exploramos otras tem\u00e1ticas, como por ejemplo, la ense\u00f1anza de la Inmunolog\u00eda en el grado y posgrado. Adem\u00e1s, promovimos la visualizaci\u00f3n de las actividades que nuestros socios y socias m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes realizaron para combatir la informaci\u00f3n falsa y para generar confianza en la vacunaci\u00f3n. Por otra parte, haci\u00e9ndonos eco de una demanda de nuestros inmun\u00f3logos cl\u00ednicos, tratamos de motivar su participaci\u00f3n en nuestra Sociedad, generando actividades de su inter\u00e9s particular. Quisiera agradecer especialmente a la Comisi\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, que ha desempe\u00f1ado su rol con suma responsabilidad atendiendo m\u00e1s de 50 consultas durante el a\u00f1o.

Noviembre, 2021.Discurso de la Dra. Paula Schaiquevich, Presidenta AAFE. Queridos colegas Es un honor para m\u00ed darles la bienvenida a la LIII reuni\u00f3n anual de la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Farmacolog\u00eda Experimental (AAFE) que se realiza de manera conjunta este a\u00f1o con la Sociedad Argentina de Investiga - ci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica, Sociedad de Inmunolog\u00eda y la Sociedad Argentina de Nanomedicinas. En primer lugar, agradezco el trabajo, dedicaci\u00f3n y compromiso de los miembros de las comisiones direc - tivas pertenecientes a las sociedades cient\u00edficas biom\u00e9dicas que participamos de este evento, para llevar adelante la reuni\u00f3n anual que hoy nos convoca en tan importante evento acad\u00e9mico-cient\u00edfico. Una vez m\u00e1s, debemos desarrollar la presente reuni\u00f3n de manera virtual como es de p\u00fablico conocimien - to como consecuencia de la pandemia de COVID-19. A pesar de la distancia f\u00edsica, nos encontraremos cercanos, compartiendo d\u00edas con alta intensidad de contenidos acad\u00e9micos abordando una diversidad de tem\u00e1ticas biom\u00e9dicas y con la participaci\u00f3n de un gran n\u00famero de oradores convocados por las diversas sociedades cient\u00edficas. Es de remarcar, que los investigadores j\u00f3venes y becarios tendr\u00e1n una especial participaci\u00f3n lo que denota el compromiso de nuestras sociedades para formar y transmitir el conocimiento cient\u00edfico. Desde sus comienzos, la existencia y desarrollo de la AAFE se bas\u00f3 en nuclear a los investigadores que tra - bajasen en tem\u00e1ticas relacionadas con farmacolog\u00eda experimental y cl\u00ednica tal de impulsar el desarrollo de esta disciplina en el pa\u00eds, estrechar las relaciones y complementar el trabajo de investigaci\u00f3n entre farmac\u00f3 - logos y promover el adelanto y divulgaci\u00f3n de los conocimientos en farmacolog\u00eda fomentando el intercambio cient\u00edfico entre los miembros de la sociedad y la vinculaci\u00f3n entre farmac\u00f3logos de la regi\u00f3n. La AAFE es una sociedad cient\u00edfica que ha transitado 52 a\u00f1os de actividad ininterrumpida, a\u00f1os durante los que han participado y participan diversos cient\u00edficos vinculados a la investigaci\u00f3n en todas las \u00e1reas de la farmacolo - g\u00eda, generando v\u00ednculos con otras sociedades cient\u00edficas nacionales, as\u00ed como de la regi\u00f3n latinoamericana y a nivel internacional siendo miembro participe de la International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR). En este sentido, es nuestro enorme placer contar en esta ocasi\u00f3n con el presidente y secretario de la IUPHAR como disertantes as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n, de miembros de las comisiones cient\u00edficas de sociedades hermanas del \u00e1rea de farmacolog\u00eda de Brasil y Chile. Es nuestra intenci\u00f3n que la AAFE mantenga y potencie su lugar en el campo de la farmacolog\u00eda internacional, manteniendo v\u00ednculos ya existentes y generando nuevas colaboraciones para fomentar los aspectos acad\u00e9micos y cient\u00edficos de la farmacolog\u00eda en un entorno de integraci\u00f3n multidisciplinaria. Actualmente, y siguiendo las tendencias internacionales, los miembros de la asociaci\u00f3n trabajamos activa - mente en farmacolog\u00eda b\u00e1sica y asimismo tenemos una fuerte representaci\u00f3n de expertos en farmacolog\u00eda cl\u00ednica humana y veterinaria. En este sentido, se denota el compromiso de nuestros investigadores con la comunidad, reforzando el rol de los mismos en las decisiones cl\u00ednicas y farmacol\u00f3gicas, mostrando un compromiso con nuestra sociedad para brindar respuestas en el \u00e1rea de la farmacolog\u00eda que as\u00ed se requie - ran. Hemos y continuamos teniendo un rol importante en esta situaci\u00f3n tan particular que nos toca vivir, la pandemia de COVID-19, en la que los avances farmacol\u00f3gicos de nuevas mol\u00e9culas, f\u00e1rmacos de reposi - cionamiento y la evaluaci\u00f3n e identificaci\u00f3n de nuevos tratamientos han sido fundamentales para brindar alternativas terap\u00e9uticas en un cort\u00edsimo plazo de evaluaci\u00f3n. Esto denota la necesidad de reforzar y po - tenciar la participaci\u00f3n del farmac\u00f3logo cl\u00ednico en nuestra asociaci\u00f3n para satisfacer las necesidades de la sociedad e incluso agencias regulatorias. Es por ello, que nuestra visi\u00f3n es la de ser la asociaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica referente para el asesoramiento t\u00e9cnico-social y regulatorio para la toma de decisiones en aspectos relacio -nados con la farmacolog\u00eda cl\u00ednica de medicamentos y productos en desarrollo en poblaciones diversas que as\u00ed lo requieran en Argentina. Esperamos que puedan aprovechar los contenidos brindados en esta reuni\u00f3n anual, que puedan participar activamente de las actividades programadas, fomentando el intercambio cient\u00edfico-acad\u00e9mico entre miem - bros de la comunidad cient\u00edfica de las diversas sociedades que hoy nos reunimos con una visi\u00f3n integrado - ra, multi0 y transdisciplinaria. En nombre de la comisi\u00f3n directiva de AAFE les dejo un saludo afectuoso y los invito una vez m\u00e1s a partici - par activamente de la reuni\u00f3n anual. Discurso de la Dra. Hebe Dur\u00e1n, Presidenta Nanomed-ar. Querid@s compa\u00f1er@s y amig@s de la comunidad cient\u00edfica, Nos encontramos este a\u00f1o nuevamente para participar de la Reuni\u00f3n Conjunta de Sociedades de Biocien - cias. Me dirijo a ustedes como Presidenta de la Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Nanomedicinas (Nanomed-ar) en representaci\u00f3n de nuestra Comisi\u00f3n Directiva. En esta oportunidad compartimos esta reuni\u00f3n con SAIC, SAI y AAFE. Mantenemos nuestro inter\u00e9s en la concreci\u00f3n de estas reuniones conjuntas con otras Socieda - des del \u00e1rea Biom\u00e9dica, con la visi\u00f3n de que la discusi\u00f3n de avances cient\u00edficos en el \u00e1rea es muy relevante dado el car\u00e1cter multidisciplinario de la Nanomedicina. La difusi\u00f3n de trabajos en un \u00e1mbito donde confluyen cient\u00edfic@s dedicados a tem\u00e1ticas diversas de la Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica resulta sumamente valioso para la generaci\u00f3n de nuevas ideas que permitan el desarrollo de proyectos enfocados a la resoluci\u00f3n de proble - mas relacionados con la Salud. No podemos dejar de mencionar que el contexto de pandemia en que se ha visto inmerso no solo nuestro pa\u00eds, sino el mundo entero durante los \u00faltimos dos a\u00f1os, nos ha enfrentado a toda la humanidad a nuevos desaf\u00edos para poder salir adelante de una situaci\u00f3n global extremadamente dolorosa. La pandemia demos - tr\u00f3 fuertemente el valor de la Ciencia y la Tecnolog\u00eda y de un fuerte Sistema P\u00fablico de Salud. Nuestro pa\u00eds, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de dificultades, ha estado a la altura de los desaf\u00edos tanto en C&T como en Salud, sabiendo lo que esto signific\u00f3 para todo el personal esencial, principalmente en el \u00e1rea de la Salud. Nos queda el sabor amargo de las p\u00e9rdidas en vidas que esta pandemia nos ha dejado. Desde Nanomed-ar, agradecemos a las y los trabajadores esenciales que han permitido sobrellevar estos tiempos de pandemia y aislamiento de la mejor manera posible. Hoy, en noviembre de 2021, vemos un horizonte de salida, gracias al r\u00e1pido avance de la implementaci\u00f3n de vacunas anti-COVID. Asimismo, para sobrellevar estos tiempos, debimos reformular las formas de comunicarnos e interactuar para poder seguir trabajando, compartiendo eventos, dando y recibiendo clases en todos los niveles edu - cativos. La virtualidad se nos hizo cotidiana, con todas las dificultades que eso implica, aunque tambi\u00e9n pudimos obtener algunas ventajas, como el hecho de acercarnos a quienes habitualmente no podemos interactuar por largas distancias y costosos viajes para encontrarnos en un meeting. A modo de ejemplo, en la Reuni\u00f3n Anual 2020 de Nanomed-ar realizada de forma virtual, pudimos contar con la participaci\u00f3n de prestigios@s cient\u00edfic@s de diferentes partes del mundo, quienes de forma desinteresada se mostraron abiert@s, no s\u00f3lo a disertar, sino tambi\u00e9n a participar en fruct\u00edferas discusiones cient\u00edficas, sin importar en algunos casos las enormes diferencias horarias que llevaron a algunos Investigadores a participar en horarios nocturnos. Con respecto a nuestra Asociaci\u00f3n, realizamos en este evento conjunto, nuestra XI Reuni\u00f3n Anual y esta - mos cumpliendo 11 a\u00f1os de la creaci\u00f3n de Nanomed-ar. Quiero saludar y agradecer a quienes me precedie - ron en la conducci\u00f3n de Nanomed-ar, cient\u00edficas y cient\u00edficos pioneros en el desarrollo de la Nanomedicina en nuestro pa\u00eds. Quiero recalcar tambi\u00e9n que nuestra Asociaci\u00f3n ha valorizado siempre la posibilidad de dar lugar a j\u00f3venes investigadores en formaci\u00f3n y estudiantes de doctorado y de grado, d\u00e1ndoles la oportunidad de presentar sus trabajos en sesiones conjuntas con Investigadores formados de amplia trayectoria, sumado al incentivo de premios a los mejores trabajos presentados en sesiones de posters o mini-orales. Este a\u00f1o la Reuni\u00f3n Conjunta cuenta con numerosos simposios, conferencias, sesiones de posters que abarcan una enorme variedad de tem\u00e1ticas, sumando adem\u00e1s simposios dedicados a la presentaci\u00f3n de logros de grupos de investigaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en la lucha contra la pandemia. El excelente programa que po - dr\u00e1n apreciar es fruto de la intensa actividad realizada por los miembros de las Comisiones Directivas de las cuatro sociedades participantes, quienes conjuntamente con la empresa G2 y la Secretaria de SAIC, se cargaron al hombro la laboriosa tarea de ocuparse de todas las actividades requeridas para que esta Reuni\u00f3n sea un \u00e9xito en su formato virtual. Agradezco tambi\u00e9n a todas y todos los participantes, Investigadores, Becarias y Becarios y Asistentes a la Reuni\u00f3n Anual que se suman a este evento. En particular, como Nanomed-ar, quiero agradecer a los Coordinadores de Simposios y a l@s miembros del Comit\u00e9 Cient\u00edfico, por su trabajo conjunto en la coordinaci\u00f3n y selecci\u00f3n de premios y a los subsidios y auspicios que hemos recibido de la ANPCyT, la Fundaci\u00f3n Balseiro, la Fundaci\u00f3n Argentina de Nanotecno - log\u00eda y la empresa Atom Protect. Para cerrar y pensando en un contexto m\u00e1s global, como cient\u00edfic@s responsables debemos ser cons - cientes de la importante necesidad de alertar a los poderes gobernantes de la importancia de la C&T para mejorar las condiciones de vida y las condiciones del planeta que nos alberga. Se requieren pol\u00edticas de C&T que apunten a adoptar medidas para frenar el cambio clim\u00e1tico, mejorar las posibilidades de Salud e implementar pol\u00edticas que tiendan a lograr condiciones de vida dignas en todas las regiones del planeta. Para esto los que manejan los poderes del mundo necesitan a tod@s los cient\u00edfic@s no solo de nuestras \u00e1reas de Salud y Biociencias, sino de todas las \u00e1reas del conocimiento. Aportemos nuestros granitos de arena en esta direcci\u00f3n. Sin m\u00e1s que agregar, les deseamos a tod@s que disfruten de esta Reuni\u00f3n Anual Conjunta y esperamos que en el a\u00f1o 2022, la situaci\u00f3n de Salud P\u00fablica nos permita la presencialidad y podamos encontrarnos en nuestra Reuni\u00f3n Anual de NANOMED-ar.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Francisco Stefano Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina A scientist and a teacher he has left strong footprints on the Pharmacological Sciences of our country. Born in Santa Fe province, at an early age his family moved to Chaco, Saenz Pe\u00f1a city. He studied at the Faculty of Chemical Sciences, C\u00f3rdoba and graduated as a bio - chemist in 1955 and as a pharmacist in 1957. He obtained a Rotary Club scholarship to work at the \"Istituto Superio - re di Sanit\u00e0\" Rome, under the direction of Amilcare Carpi. The high hierarchy of this Institute was a magnet, attract - ed eminent scientists giving the possibility to meet and interact with the greats of that time. He developed a close relation with the Nobel Prize Daniel Bovet, Victor Whit - taker and James Mc Gaugh. These were the solid basis that constructed the personality of Otto Orsingher. At his return to Argentine was invited to join the group being formed by Ivan Izquierdo at the Pharmacology Depart - ment, Faculty of Chemical Sciences of the University of C\u00f3rdoba. In the optimistic environment prevailing at that time, formed with Izquierdo a duo of notable scientists who will contribute to the growth of Pharmacological Sci - ences. But things were not as good as thought and Izqui - erdo left C\u00f3rdoba in 1973 charge of the Department of Pharmacology and kept the working enthusiasm. He studied in rats the effects of perinatal undernutrition on the learning and memory performance of the adult animal and showed the importance of peri - natal nutrition in the development of brain functions. His research performed 40 years ago is quoted nowadays by scientist working in this field (Perinatal undernutrition reduces alpha and beta adrenergic receptor binding in brain- Science, antiepileptic effects of (Effect compounds hippocampal seizure discharges Psychopharmacologia, 1973). Of the one hundred and odd citations that this work has, 20% are in publications after 2017, 44 years later. Besides his intense teaching in Argentine Association for Experimental Pharmacology, Meetings etc. Appointed as Director of the INAME (The National Insti - tute of Drugs) in1993 he contributed to the transparency and modernization of the institution. Orsingher was not only an excellent scientist, he was a good man, loyal to colleagues and interested in the ad - vancement of science and did not seek laurels or envy those who seek them. MELATONIN.

In the following decade, TCGA collected than 11,000 cases across 33 types, and generated a vast, comprehensive data set describ - ing the molecular changes that occur in cancer. Tissue sample collection and data generation were completed in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Network maker papers, which are integrative cross-platform analyses of TCGA data on individual cancer types have been published for 31 of the tumor types to date (https://cancergenome.nih. gov/publications) The value of the TCGA a more meaningful taxonomy of cancer types and subtypes, and to even investigate questions that were not imagined at the outset of the project, such as the mining of the data to discover new viruses and other microbial agents. The TCGA marker papers have served as additional resources for understanding the molecular features of these cancers, and a launching pad for indi - vidual researchers to deepen the exploration of the data generated. However, translation to the clinic of the wealth of informa - tion gathered during the project has been modest, mainly for of extensive clinical data and outcomes, but also because focusing mainly on single gene that are a poor reflection of the biological reality.MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl.

Elba Vazquez Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires IQUIBICEN - CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina Currently our view of cancer has evolved to include, in addition to the transformed cells that have deregulated homeostatic mechanisms, a wide spectrum of cells of the tumor microenvironment. The dialogue established between the tumor cells and the microenvironment, is an essential determinant of the characteristics of the tumor progression. The completion of the human genome sequence has generated great expectations in the development of new cancer therapies. However, considering the heterogene - ity treatment.

Checkpoint inhibitors are currently being investigated in the early-stage agents. Our efforts have been directed to both the development of nov -el therapeutic approaches and the understanding of the processes involved in drug-related efficacy. In this presentation, the development of pre-clinical animal models of TNBC will be discussed in the context of their use as key tools to test for novel therapeutic con - cepts and the mechanisms involved in their response. In addition, an overview of current ongoing projects in our laboratory will be discussed. It is expected, as it's the case in several of our preclinical investigations, that these concepts may translate in the near future into their clinical evaluation, as well as to serve as the bases for supporting their development.

This generated a collapse not only in health systems but also in interna - tional trade, cutting the supply chain of medical supplies. The first official case registered in our country occurred at the beginning of March 2020. Faced with this scenar - io, our laboratory presented a proposal to the National Executive Power for the development and manufacture of molecular diagnostic tests and columns for RNA purifi - cation, two critical inputs necessary to meet the growing demand of the national diagnostic network. Thanks to the financing of the Corporaci\u00f3n Andina de Fomento (CAF), we established a public-private consortium between IIB- UNSAM, the UNQ molecular biology laboratory, and the companies Productos Bio-L\u00f3gicos SA and Chemtest SA who contributed their human and technical resources, and administrative capacities to carry out the task. The consortium with the collaboration of different dependen - cies of the National State brought from China the critical supplies for the development and production of 700,000 manual and automated RNA purification kits that were distributed throughout material immunochromato (NALFIA) was developed. nano components developed and manufactured entirely in the country, al - lowing the detection of the viral genetic material present in for thermal cyclers. This technol - ogy made it possible decentralize the COVID 19 diag - nosis and implement it even in rural areas where there was no infrastructure for molecular diagnosis. In this way, we took advantage of a unique opportunity that allowed us to articulate actions and capacities of both the public and private sectors, converging on a common goal.

MANAGEMENT OF SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY IN ARGENTINA: CARE EVOLUTION AND CURRENT SITUATION Soledad Monges Department of Neurology, Hospital de Pediatr\u00eda \"Prof. Dr. Juan P. Garrahan\", Buenos Aires, Argentina Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal reces - sive ing causes of infant mortality. It is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. Over the past two decades, knowl - edge on the disease has greatly increased leading to the development of new treatments and the approval of the first drug Spinraza by the F.D.A. (Food and Drug Admin - istration, USA) at the end of 2016. General management and care of SMA patients varies due to heterogeneous health care in Latam as in Argentina. In 1997, the first molecular studies of the SMN1 gene were performed in our country. In 2006, a program was set up for patient care, teaching, and research in NMD at Hospital Garrah - an in order to improve the quality of life of SMA patients. A dedicated and trained interdisciplinary team was set among others. The team covers different aspects of the SMA patient ranging from diagnosis to transition to adult care and end-of-life pal - liative care for the patients and their families. In 2004, families of patients with SMA have set up a non-profit as - sociation in Argentina (FAME; www.fameargentina.com. ar/). This parent association has been a strong advocate for and sponsor of the development of early diagnosis, care, and research, allowing for health professionals in the field to attend international meetings and online courses and participating in the organization of training symposia. Different regional academic-scientific organi - zations are contributing to the increased quality of the management of SMA pa - tients. In spite of these efforts in Argentina, the treatment gap - the difference between people with SMA and the patients who are actually treated - is still wide. There is a need to create new awareness of the disease so as to get to an early diagnosis and treatment. SIMPOSIO SAI N\u00b0 4: TISSUE SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE II Chairs: Dra.

How can we measure the presence of this (these) substance(s) during the shelf-life? What about a dose response? etc I feel this is the moment to have a further advancement of a collaboration among and regulators. References.

THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR AN ETHICAL DILEMMA Mario Cisneros Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Argentina. On May 5, 2021, the US administration surprised the world by openly supporting the release of patents in hands of pharmaceutical companies protecting COVID-19 vac - cines, an initiative that, if implemented, would allow other companies to replicate the technologies involved any - where without previous authorization by its developers. The decision, according to the aims to \"get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible\". Activist and the WHO celebrated the world. Nevertheless, pharmaceutical companies pointed out that following this policy will bring them not only economic losses, but also will damage to the global pharmaceutical innovation sys - tem. Although there is a general perception about the bene - fits generated by the existence of a legal system for the protection of inventions, the reality is that such a system entails social costs that must be taken into account and can only be justified if the general long-term generated benefits exceed the costs. stipulates that the patent system comes to solve mar - ket failures generated by their nature as \"non-rivals\" and MEDICINA - Volumen 81 - (Supl. III), 202148 assets, according to if the economic benefits generat - ed bu them can not be appropriated by their creators. In turn, the economic monopoly granted by patents predicts a cost to society created by the inefficiency of the market, in this case, by the lack of competition for a given prod - uct. There are a variety of counterarguments against this theory.This work aims to introduce the theoretical foundations to address the existing tension between two conflicting positions: on the one hand, the need to have economic incentives that motivate vaccine developers investments in order to have safe, effective, rapidly available vaccines and, on the one hand, the right of people and society to access essential medicines. PATENTS: PRINCIPLE OF TERRITORIALITY, licenses are temporary limitation National States can exclusive patent - ed inventions. That implies the possibility of third parties to exploit holders' - ry licenses as a tool for national production of vaccines against the virus. However, it is necessary in purpose, or whether it is required to identify other of measures to be carried out. Intellectual tends in cutting-edge technologies for innovation. In this sense, and specifically regarding patents, national and international regulations grant exclusive rights to patent applicants, requiring in turn a sufficient disclosure of the information related to the invention. Furthermore, exclu - sive rights are granted for a term of up to 20 years, if granted. Therefore, after the expiration of this period, or in the event that a expires for administrative reasons or owner rights, or if the patent ap - plication is never granted, the information becomes part of the domain public and free to operate then within all countries where the patent has not been applied for and granted. Additionally, not all the information required for produc - tion is part of one or more patents (either because it is not novel, or it lacks of inventive step, that is, it is obvious for a person skilled in the matter). Likewise, there may be information that has not been ever disclosed (confidential information, industrial se - crets about production techniques, trade secrets of raw material suppliers, not ensure a successful transfer of technology and as - sociated knowledge, necessary for building the required facilities, training human resources for production, and acquisition of necessary materials. Contrarily, successful technology transfer has been achieved with licensing contracts, such as Sputnik - Richmond, and Oxford - AstraZeneca cases.

DNA damage caused naturally by UV light in skin cells triggers not only lesion repair mechanisms but also the control of gene expression in UV-treated cells. Since DNA is the only biopolymer that is neither dis - posable nor recyclable, it must be repaired when dam - aged. Among the various repair systems that human cells have, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system is the one that deals with most of UV light-induced le - sions. Damage detection by NER system occurs by two different DNA-sensing mechanisms that then converge on the same in front of a UV-induced DNA lesion is degraded so as to machinery therefore, different evi -dences suggest that the scenario could be different. On the one hand, most of the repair of lesions in template strands in only lesions repaired by TC-NER, occurs in the first hours post UV, while degradation of RNAPII is observed hours later. On the other hand, preliminary results from our group show that RNAPII degradation is by the the GG-NER (GG-NER TC- NER WT cells) and observed a marked inhibition in the RNAPII in to UV light.

It codes for NKX2-5, a transcription factor a number of other transcription factors involved in the development and function of the early heart, among other functions. This gene was the first where a single genetic variant (GV) was related an exhaustive database of all GVs in the gene. In this study, we aimed to expand this information by predicting the effect of some GVs in the functionality of the NKX2-5 protein. In order to do that, we proposed a classification of all possible missense GVs in the structured region of the protein according to the most probable effect they would have on its functionality. We worked with all the possible amino acid variants caused by a change in a single DNA base pair in the homeodomain (HD) region (n=337). The in and conservation.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli is responsible for Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a cause of renal failure in children. Renal damage has been associated with Shiga toxin (Stx), which binds to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor on the plasma membrane of target cells. We have previously an Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) in human cortical renal tubular epithelial cells (HRTEC) primary cultures. The aim of this work was to clarify the mode of interaction of EG in the ac - tive site of GLS and its possible called molecular docking was carried out with Smina software and Gibbs free energy was calculat - ed for determining the stability of the conformation formed between the ligand and the receptor. On the other hand, the expression of Gb3 receptor was analyzed by TLC in samples of HRTEC treated with EG (50 nM, 24 h) in the presence and absence of Stx2 (1 ng/ ml). Docking control cells.

NKX2-5 is a homeobox gene of very early expression in humans. It codes for NKX2-5, a transcription factor that regulates the expres sion of a number of other factors involved in the devel - opment and function of the early heart, among other functions. This gene was the first where a single genetic variant (GV) was related an exhaustive database of all GVs in the gene. In this study, we aimed to expand this information by predicting the effect of some GVs in the func - tionality of the NKX2-5 protein. In order to do that, we proposed a classification of all possible missense GVs in the structured region of the protein according to the most probable effect they would have on its functionality. We worked with all the possible amino acid variants caused by a change in a single DNA base pair in the homeodomain (HD) region (n=337). The in and conservation. Taken together, these of the possible effect of GVs on the functionality of NKX2-5. Our analysis determined that 32 GVs may affect the interaction with DNA (9.5%), 10 may have an effect on functionality due to introduc - ing a 38 may affect a estimate the potential effect of GVs on NKX2-5. In particular, it contributes to a functional prediction of yet unknown GVs, it proposes a mechanism for pathogenesis of known and to better understand the genotype-phenotype rela - tionship in the development of CHD. 28.

Our was to analyze the consequence of the splicing acceptor site variant per - formed and sequenced by Sanger. Two isoforms of different molecular weight were observed. The most abundant with the highest molecular (A) had a 14bp deletion, while the less abundant with lower molecular weight had a exon 33 complete deletion. The sequencing allowed the prediction that A would produce a frameshift (FS) with the appearance of a premature translation codon, leading to the absence of dystrophin protein. On the other hand, it is expected that FS will not be produced in B and a shorter dystrophin protein will be generated. This finding agrees with immunohistochemistry where DYS 1, 2 and 3 domains were pre - served.

Dystrophinopathies cover a spectrum of rare progressive X-linked muscle diseases, arising from common neuromuscular diseases, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) the most severe form. Despite that there is still no cure for these diseases, advances are being made for the develop spectrum in an co - hort, to identify candidates for available treatments and, to conduct a comparative analysis of the Latin American (LA) frequencies of mutations amenable for skipping of exon 51, 21 for exon 53, 12 for exon 45 and another 70 for Ataluren. We determined that 87.5% of DMD patients will restore the reading frame with the skipping of only one exon. According to the meta-analysis, only 4 LA countries (Argenti - na, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico) complete the molecular algorithm for dystrophinopathies.

A, B and L can protect mucosa exposed to inflammatory insults. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of A, B and L on modulating STEC pathogenicity. by SDS-PAGE and bacterial adherence to Caco-2 cells. We found that 50 mM of A and B, and 100 mM of the three compounds inhibited bacterial if those concentrations that did not inhibit STEC growth had an effect on the expression of EspB, a protein from type three secretion sys - tem that is involved in bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. We did not observe differences on EspB of bacterial adherence to Caco-2 cells in the presence of A and B 1mM compared to control media (median%(IQR): Media=81(69-87); In conclusion, acetate butyrate were able to reduce bacterial ad - herence to Caco-2 cells in concentrations that do not inhibit bacterial growth.

The role of IL-17 signaling in tumor progression is discussed aim is to determine the role of signaling in tumor progression we used (melanoma) and cells that ac - growth in hosts deficient in IL-17 signaling. These data led us to hypothesize that IL-17 may trigger different transcriptional programs in both cell lines to promote or restrain - mor progression. To evaluate this, we performed RNA-seq to com - pare the transcriptomes and differentially expressed genes (DEG) in B16 and after different were linked to significant differences in the expression of genes of IL-17 pathway in the basal condition. Exposure to treated cells revealed 374 DEG (179 up and 195 down) in B16 cells, and 535 DEGs (444 up and 96 down) in EL4 cells with only 12 genes in common (6up, in IL-17-treated B16 cells pathways different tumor cells that may mod -ulate tumor growth likely as consequence of particular profiles of IL-17R subunit expression. 237.

The subcloning of a2 MICA domain was done with a pET-JT1 vector, which was introduced into E.coli D5H by chemical competency. Through a clonal selection, we obtained the DNA and then sequenced the insert with external primers. Second, we intro - duced the vector with the 2 MICA domain sequence, into E.coli BL21 and produced the recombinant protein by with The purification of protein was done separating the medium and cells, and then, lysing the cells, and pu - rifying the proteins recombinant MICA external do - main (MICAsp). Results: After the subcloning, the sequence had a high identity with the original gene. The protein structure model was obtained using the Swiss-Model server. The chromatogram showed a high pres - ence of protein in the supernatant of lysis, but only a of this should be retained by the column, and be into the elu - tion fraction. The 2 domain was bond to the NKG2D recombinant protein, in different concentration, at the re - MICAsp higher this signal is half to obtained with MICAsp, indicated that this domain provide, at less, half capacity of binding. Conclusions: This work showed the possibility of production and purification of 2 MICA domain, and its functionality in the binding to NKG2D, allowing to know the importance of the 2 domain in the union with the receptor. 238.

The placenta and fetal membranes have recently been proposed as an important stem cells source for regenerative medicine. Stem cells derived from amniotic membrane offer considerable advantages over other stem cells because of the ease of collection, their low im - munogenicity and minimal ethical and legal barriers are associated with their use. Amniotic epithelial cells isolated from the amnion ex - press embryonic stem cells markers and are pluripotent. Not only are amnion-derived stem cells in regenerative medicine, but also have antitumoral properties. Hepatic failure is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality. In particular, the hepatocarcinoma is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. A few studies have demonstrated the antitumoral effects of the amniotic membrane and their cells, but little is known about the molecular and cellular mech - anisms involved. The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of some important pro and expression of the proapoptotic decrease in antiapoptotic genes and proteins expression, after 24 and 72 h of treatment with AM-CM.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play key processes, such as cell fraction of them are regulators throughout neural development. Due this, characterize miRNAs involved in stem cells (NSCs) from H9 hESCs differentiated these cells into neurons (NEU). We next performed a high throughput small RNA sequencing of these cell populations followed by bioinformat - with no less than 10 reads and visualized a heat to represent the miRNA expression profile. Then, we carried out a differential expression analysis (FDR 0.5) and found 270 it caught our attention the hsa-miR-216a,b/217 only expressed in NSC and NEU. Moreover, this was reported in published RNA-Seq bioinformatic data - sets of other neural cell types but not along mesoderm and endo - derm differentiations or in other species or types of pluripotent stem cells datasets. Besides, there is no bibliographic data of this family associated to neural differentiation or regulation of stemness. In a future, we aim to knock out the whole cluster using the CRISPR/ Cas9 technology as a loss-of-function strategy. This will enable us to characterize the function and targets of this cluster in a neurogenic context. 302. (409) 3D CELL CULTURES IN ENFINEERING Juan Rojas1 1. de Fisicoqu\u00edmica, 2.

Epicardial adi - pose tissue (EAT) is a visceral adipose tissue surrounding myocardi - um and coronary arteries, proposed to be an independent risk factor for CVD. The lipidomic study of tissues reveals the role of many bio - active lipids such as ceramides (Cer) on their metabolism. In EAT, lipids may contribute to CVD contributing to an increase in and therefore in CVD. We assessed the lipidome of EAT from CAD as well, demonstrating an enrichment in Cer. In this op - portunity, our aim was to evaluate links among tissue. Methods and results: in EAT and subcutaneous AT (SAT) from undergoing say western blot, respectively. Tissue lipidomes were evaluated by UHPLC-MS, in positive and negative ionization modes. For statistics, the MetaboAnalyst software was used. In EAT, we found an increase in LPL activity, directly associated with total Cer and plas - malogens. No associations were SAT.

At low doses, the major prevalence of growth decrease was ob - served for NFX-MMSiO2 in comparison to the same doses of concentrations to NFX. There was exposed decline in the inhibitory growth activity of NFX according to its mini - mum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in contrast to MMSiO2 which ac remained constant. It was also observed that MMSiO2 did not present a direct effect on the bacteria. However, these NPs could have enhanced the antibiotic effect at lower doses. This fact may be due to the outcome of iron from the NPs and to changes in the ionic force to specific sites in the organism under the influence of an external magnetic field, at low concentration to ensure a better performance in comparison to free NFX. 362.

Aim: to study in this HSS model if the increase in pressure is accom - panied by the immune system (IS) cells infiltration in renal tissue, and to evaluate the expression of the CD4 + and intact female (IF) and oVx normal (NS) or high sodium (HS) diet. Methods: At 60 days of life, half of the rats were ovariectomized, and at 145 days IF and oVx rats were divided into NS (0.24% NaCl) or HS NaCl in drinking water) 150 systolic blood pressure (SBP, tail-cuff method) recorded IF \u00b1 7.1, oVx NS: 127 \u00b1 3.0, oVx HS: 142 \u00b1 7.3*. * p <0.05 oVx HS vs all other groups. CD4 expression of PBL in IF HS is lower respect to IF NS (p <0.001), while in oVx HS it is higher respect to oVx NS (p <0.01). CD8 increased in only oVx HS respect to the other groups (p <0.05). The presence of CD45 was found only in the renal cortex of oVx HS rats. The increase an and - eration of IS in HSS promoting the infiltration of cells in key tissues. The response of the IS to the HS diet is different according to the hormonal context, which is a key point to understand the progres - sion of the disease. 381.

University students (US) often consume alcohol for recreational pur - poses being exposed to various negative consequences that this substance produces. Different factors have associated increased alcohol (AC), such as personality, alcohol expectancies and social isolation (e.g. COVID-19 lockdown). Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the AC pattern and the potential influence of personality, alcohol expectancies and lockdown in stu - dents from the University of Buenos Aires. A sample of 1776 US completed an online survey that assessed the amount and frequency of AC before and during the first year of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, US was In and but more drinking When comparing both evaluated (positive and negative), in both sexes (rs= 0.11 to 0.37).

After that, striosomes of the cor - pus striatum and the fornix columns were myelinated at 133 e.d. At birth time (155 e.d.), all the intra-hemispheric white matter structures were myelinated, but the inter-hemispheric connections of the cor - pus callosum and the anterior commissure were not myelinated yet. These results show that both the onset of the myelination process and its progression during embryonic development are framed in the precocial character of L. maximus. The onset of this process in vizcacha agreed with that in guinea pig, and was in contrast to the postnatal onset in rat and mouse. Grant: Fundaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica Felipe 418.

The cancer treatment as a neoadjuvant therapy to reduce tumor volume prior to surgery and as a post-surgical adju - vant. However, in some cases tumors do not respond to treatment. Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) are a minority tumor cell population, as - sociated to chemoresistance. Thus, the an in vitro sphere-forming assay can predict CSC issue for these patients.

BACKGROUND: Until today there are 229,414,751 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) called COVID-19, all over the world. COVID-19 can be asymptoma - tic or cause a respiratory distress syndrome and death. The risk of COVID-19 and mortality for COVID-19 have been associated with older age and comorbidities, such as cancer. The situation is a great challenge for these patients. Furthermore, in patients with active treatment, the decrease in populations involved in protection is may be impaired. OBJECTIVES: Here we described the population of oncological (P and non-oncological (P NOn) patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 hospitalized at the HUA from December, 2020 to Sep - tember, 2021. Peripheral blood samples were collected at the response oncological disease in treatment, 5 male median age 59 with lung (4) and scalp (1) cancer and 6 female median age 36 with ovarian (1), cervix (2), renal (1) rectum (1) and breast cancer (1) with mode - rate (9) or severe (2) COVID-19 and 13 patients without oncological disease male median median age 40, with moderate (12) or severe (1) COVID-19. The POn group had a longer hospital stay (15.9 vs 8.8 days; p 0.016) and 0.085). The mortality rate in POn was 36% and there were no deaths in PNon. The circulating immune response for SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed in samples different times from the 24 hospitalized patients. The protective res - ponse was significantly lower in the POn population (p <0.001) with low detection of IgM and IgG. CONCLUSIONS: in POn the protecti - ve response is lower compared to PNon, with probable implications in morbidity and mortality.

These fractions were incubated on receptor cells with or without 5-FC, and cell viability was determined by the APH method after 5 days. Results: As expected, the SN fraction of 5-FU CM was accountable for bystander cytotoxicity, while the P fraction was not. In most cell lines only the SN fraction of CDU/5-FC treated cells responsi - ble for presumably by 5-FU presence on the CM.

Beer is widely consumed by population. Cereals used in be contaminated by mycotoxins. to estimate different mycotoxins (FB, trichothecenes, OTA, ZEA, AFB) in beer in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Materials and Methods : A survey was carried out by google form (n = 314) to know the consumption of beer and to determine the exposure to different mycotoxins. Results : From the surveyed population over 18 years old, 79.8% consume beer. The highest daily beer con - sumption (284.4 ml/day) of population industrial beer and 23.4% only consumes craft beer. From the daily beer intake surveyed in this study and the occurrence of mycotoxins in beer of previous publications, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of mycotoxins was obtained. It was observed that beer consumption contributed to 8.5, 5.1, 18.5 and 0.38% of the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of ochra - toxin A (OTA), fumonisin B (FB), toxin T-2 (T-2) and zearalenone (ZEA) respectively. In the case of DON, it was estimated that beer consumption contributes with 67.6% of TDI. Previous publications informed that the occurrence of DON in 60 % of beers were less than 10 ng/ml (% of DON TDI= 4.47 %) and craft beer could reach 63 ng/ml (% of DON TDI= 63 %).
