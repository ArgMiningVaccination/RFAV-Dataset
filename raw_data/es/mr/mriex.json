Ayurveda is an ancient and proven system from India for creating balance and vibrant health. This app by Meditation Oasis provides an easy way to apply the principles of healthy eating from Ayurveda to our everyday food choices. According to Ayurveda, the qualities of your mind and body are determined by three biological \"energies\" these three bio-energies that result in their mind-body type or constitution. By determining your basic constitution and assessing your current imbalances, you will be able to modify your diet to create greater balance. App Features: Basic Constitution Quiz to help you easily determine your mind-body type Current Imbalance Quiz your dosha for choosing the right foods to balance the doshas A Dosha Clock that automatically shows the dosha for the season and time of day Sample food plans for people with three different constitutions Eating body weight improved overall health and well-being clarity of mind The information in this app is based on ancient Ayurvedic texts and the experience of over 25 years of applying these principles to daily life. Richard Maddux studied Ayurveda in India with Vaidya V. M. B. D. Triguna, and 3.0 Updated for iOS7. Improved interface. Ratings and Reviews Too simple The app is very simplistic in describing Ayurvedic principles. I wish I wouldn't $1.99, it should have been free. I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because it was a \"fun\" app. Even though the content is reliable, this app is not to be taken seriously. It is definitely not for those who are looking for extensive information. Suggestion: the app belongs in the \"free\" purchases category. Great app, except... Love the app, but on some of the screens (e.g., the quiz results screen), the info at the bottom is cut off and there is no scroll option. Please fix this. Great for beginners If you want to take the first step into learning the basics of Ayurvedic Doshas, this is the app for you. Obviously you won't become an expert through an app, but you can begin to raise awareness through research. Thank you for creating this!
