The National Health Service (NHS) says there is \"no good -quality evidence\" that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition, yet it funds it. Why and to what extent? There are now only two NHS centres offering homeopathic treatments - in London and Glasgow. Another two former ones - in Bristol and Liverpool - have been moved into the private sector, but still see NHS patients. However, the way money flows around the health service makes it hard to work out exactly how much across these anxiety may get referred to receiving homeopathic Nonetheless, the Good Thinking Society, which has been campaigning for the NHS to stop funding homeopathy, estimates spending is in the NHS also funds homeopathic remedies through amount to much in monetary terms. Last year there were nearly 9,000 issued at a cost of \u00a394,000 i n England. So let us call it about \u00a35m of NHS funding for homeopathy each year. Now that sounds like a lot of money, but to put it into context the total amount spent on the health service across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 0.004% of goes on homeopathy. It is a tiny fraction - a \"drop in the ocean\" says the association, yet enough to pay for an extra 200 nurses or 50 consultants. Homeopathy is based on the concept that diluting a version of a substance that causes illness has healing properties. For example, grass be used to create a homeopathic hay fever remedy. One part of the substance is mixed with 99 parts of water or alcohol and this is repeated six times in a \"6c\" formulation or 30 times in a \"30c\" formulation. The end result is combined with a lactose (sugar) tablet. Homeopaths say the more diluted it is, the greater the effect. Scientific consensus says patients are getting nothing but sugar. So why does the NHS fund it, given it does not even seem to believe it works? To understand that, we need to go back to the start of the NHS. Homeopathy has been used since the 1800s and, by the time the health service was created in 1948, there were five homeopathic hospitals - the four mentioned above plus another in Kent which closed in 2009. Unlike now, there was not such a vociferous campaign against its use and so homeopathic treatments were under the NHS umbrella, where they remained ever since. But in 1999 a drugs advisory body called the National Institute of Health and Care (NICE) was set up to carefully assess the cost- effectiveness of new drugs and technologies in Britain. They have looked at over 600 homeopathic treatments since, taking into account cost, how effective they are and whether there are other similar treatments available. The treatments NICE rejects get the headlines, so it may come as a surprise to many that they have actually agreed to recommend over 80% of them for NHS use. So with ever -greater emphasis on evidence -based medicine - plus the increasing strain on resources - a growing clamour for an end to homeopathy funding has developed. In 2010 the House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee called for NHS funding to stop as there was no evidence beyond a placebo effect - when a patient feels better because of their belief that the treatment works. Twenty years ago, there was close to \u00a31m a year spent on homeopathic prescriptions, but the is homeopathic centres found themselves disappearing.
