We have perceived in our Health Department several different patients with opioid consumption abuse derived threatening side effects, that\u00b4s why we conducted medical for previously admit the in our ICU After consent, we monitor all their vital constants in bed and we start a deep polymodal sedation up to the required level for each ready for oral intubation and mechanical ventilation if need- ed.

La percepci\u00f3n de la existencia de cuadros de dolor mal tratados ha provocado que muchos sistemas de salud incentiven a los profesionales en el uso de opioides, para evitar episodios de sufrimiento in\u00fatiles y est\u00e9riles. Dicha incentivaci\u00f3n, el uso de receta electr\u00f3nica, la facilitaci\u00f3n y simpleza de prescripci\u00f3n tras la desaparici\u00f3n de receta de estupefacientes tradicional, supuso una liberalizaci\u00f3n signi- fi cativa y uso de opioides progresivo entre todas las espe- cialidades m\u00e9dicas que habitualmente no los prescrib\u00edan. Adem\u00e1s, la aparici\u00f3n de nuevos opioides sint\u00e9ticos, con aparentemente menores efectos secundarios, f\u00e1ciles de usar y con buen perfi l farmacocin\u00e9tico, quiz\u00e1s ha suscitado una confi anza irreal en la inocuidad de dichos f\u00e1rmacos. Estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os han sido a\u00f1os de alta prescripci\u00f3n y de hallazgo de efectos no deseados por los elevados consumos y prescripciones un tanto quiz\u00e1 alejadas de la idoneidad y poco control sobre los pacientes. Nosotros detectamos en nuestro departamento de salud varios casos de pacientes con problemas reales derivados del consumo de opioides, de origen iatrog\u00e9nico, siempre por prescripci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica legal y con grav\u00edsimos efectos secun- darios, que conllevaban riesgo vital. Objetivo: Realizar una deshabituaci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida del consumo de opioides, sin poner en riesgo la salud y vida del paciente, de un modo rigurosamente monitorizado y controlado. Material y m\u00e9todos: Nuestra comunicaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfi ca se basa en la descripci\u00f3n del trabajo realizado sobre un grupo de pacientes afectados por un elevado consumo de opioides. Nuestro m\u00e9todo de deshabituaci\u00f3n a los opioides consiste en el ingreso de los pacientes en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensi- vos del Servicio de Anestesiolog\u00eda de nuestro hospital para la retirada absoluta de los mismos. Se realiza en primer lugar una valoraci\u00f3n basal cl\u00ednica, psicol\u00f3gica, social y biol\u00f3gica, y tras solicitar un consentimiento informado, se procede a ORIGINALDOI: 10.20986/resed.2019.3681/2018 96 M.

Dependence refers to the imperative need to the use of opioids to avoid withdrawal syndrome, and addiction is defi ned a chronic and recurrent disease of the brain characterized by the use of substances propriate use of opioid chronic illness, history of legal problems or jail sentences, white race and under 40-45 years of age, have been described (5). In the units, severe, which evolution in these cases could have produced an increase in cases of opioid addiction in patients with NCCP (1). The proportion of patients with iatrogenic addiction to opioids is very diffi cult to estimate due to the of Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th edition (DSM-5) (3). The DSM-5 defi nes the opioid use disorder cognitive, behavioral and psychological symp- toms that lead of a substance despite the problems related to its use (4). The abuse of opioids produces alterations in brain circuits, which are the underlying causes for the devel- ing the patients are stable, they are discharged to the ward for an additional 48 hours period, with psyquiatric treatment and under the care of the Addictive Conducts Unit. The patients are fi nally dis- hospital with a conducted by our Pain Unit, Addictive and Physical Rehabilitation. Results: We describe the results achieved with two different approaches which keeping the be a successful treatment in rescuing the patients from a living hell out of which they would have found it impossible to leave without qualifi ed help. We deem it safe with the right ICU surveillance, since no major complications have occurred, but a thereafter following and help is mandatory, since, like any other patient attended at a Pain Clinic, they require a favouring social and familiar environment to avoid any relapse. Finally, given our retirada de los opioides, con monitorizaci\u00f3n avanzada e inicio de sedaci\u00f3n profunda multimodal, hasta el nivel que sea necesario para cada paciente, incluso con previsi\u00f3n de posible intubaci\u00f3n orotraqueal y asistencia ventilatoria. Rea- lizamos control de diuresis y control bioqu\u00edmico, metab\u00f3lico y nutricional durante 96 horas. Posteriormente, el paciente, tras asegurar su estabilidad y seguridad, pasa a una planta de hospitalizaci\u00f3n convencional durante unas 48 horas, con tratamiento de perfi l psiqui\u00e1trico manejado por la Unidad de Conductas Adictivas. Tras ser dado de alta hospitalaria, se contin\u00faa tratamiento y control por Unidad de Conductas Adictivas, Unidad de Dolor y Unidad de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n F\u00edsica. Resultados: Describimos los resultados obtenidos con el uso de dos pautas en las que se combinan distintos grupos farmacol\u00f3gicos usados para la deshabituaci\u00f3n: midazolam, propofol, ketamina, dexmedetomidina, cloni- dina y naloxona, en la consecuci\u00f3n del mantenimiento del paciente libre de opioides garantizando la estabilidad hemo- din\u00e1mica, respiratoria y la seguridad biol\u00f3gica del paciente. Conclusiones: La desconexi\u00f3n r\u00e1pida de opioides es un tratamiento efi caz, que recupera al paciente de un infi erno vital grave del que dif\u00edcilmente se puede salir sin una ayuda externa. Lo consideramos un m\u00e9todo seguro, ya que no se nos ha presentado ninguna complicaci\u00f3n severa, aun- que son pacientes que precisan de unos cuidados m\u00e9dicos de vigilancia intensiva. El posterior seguimiento y ayuda es imprescindible, aunque como pacientes de dolor, precisan de un buen entorno social y familiar, para conseguir el apoyo necesario y no volver a recaer. Por todo ello, y en base a los resultados obtenidos en nuestro estudio, consideramos que es un m\u00e9todo adecuado y efi caz, aunque caro en recursos. Palabras clave: Opioides, abuso follow-up should be conduct- by the professionals specialized in the treatment of pain. Other important concepts to consider are tolerance and dependence. is the state of adaptation in which an increase in the doses of the opioid is required to obtain the desired effect, or there is a decrease in the effect of the substance over time (6). The continued use of opioids for chronic in the physical dependence on opioids. This chronic use is character - ized by the presence of OWS occurring after abrupt cessation, rapid reduction, decrease in level of drug in blood and/or the administration of an antagonist (7). It is important to differentiate term that an maladaptive behavior implies to compulsive and often self-destructive use (8). In the present article we describe six cases of rap - id opioid detoxification (ROD) conducted in the recov- ery unit of our hospital, between 2011 and 2016, of patients showing symptoms of opioids been with neuropathic pain, of years of evolution, with values > 7 regarding pain intensity in the visual analogue scale (VAS), in which different neuromodulators and opioids had been used from lower to higher, as indicated the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder (Table I). They are two women and four men aged 36-53 years (in the year in which the ROD was performed) socially integrated with relatives who supported them, and without medical history that contraindicated the detoxification. All the cases described in the present study were diagnosed in the consultation of the Pain Unit at our Health Department (220,000 inhabitants). Four of them referred from primary care and after being treat- ed in our unit and two of them after referral from pri- mary care with treatments already established by their general practitioners. All of them had a point in common, which consist- ed in the use of fast-acting fentanyl for the treatment of non-cancer breakthrough pain some time before they began to increase their care demands for its pre- scription, since its consumption was increasing not only regarding the daily doses administered but also regarding the amount (micrograms) prescribed. appearance and aggressiveness in the consultations and the denial that their baseline treatment was effective, verified by the anesthesiologists, by our who answers telephone consultations in the PTU, as well as by the relatives, were the symptoms that led us to diagnose the addic- tion syndrome and to addiction syndrome (DSM-5 patient that a close relative. were thoroughly informed about the addiction the patient suffered and the possibility of entering the recovery unit, where patients would be treated for a few days, the drugs that they would be using, the monitoring of vital signs and the All 6 patients accepted and signed an informed with their member and an anesthesi- ologist from our unit. METHOD All the patients were admitted in a fasted state in the morning of a Monday. A peripheral vein was cathe- terized, and blood was collected for a baseline analysis consisting of a blood count, biochemistry and coagulation determinations.TABLE I DRUGS USED PRIOR TO mg/12 Duloxetina 30 mg/24 h Fentanilo absorci\u00f3n r\u00e1pida 400 mcg/demanda98 M.

The length of the stay at the recovery unit was five days for all patients, except for one case who stayed at the unit for 8 days. In the latter case, the patient was also addicted to a his- tory of moderate associated alcoholism. There was no severe or The patients are usually discharged on the fifth day to the conventional hospitalization ward, where they stayed for 48 hours undergoing alternative treat- ment, and monitored case After discharge, treatments with sublingual spray for neuropathic began, in case. All the patients, after the detoxification, were referred to the unit of addiction behavior for following-up the progress and continued with the periodic checkup in our unit. DISCUSSION Opioid addiction is a complex disease that is difficult to treat. The treatment is divided maintenance of the opioid for treatments that ensures that the use of the drug is independent of the mental state and the cir - cumstances. Detoxification consists in the of receptor antagonists, such naloxone or trexone). The problems that clinical experience has helped us to observe is that, since the introduction of treat- ments outside effect of the drug through areas of brain stimulation (with great feeling of gratification) is greater than analgesia in at the beginning. This means that almost all of our non-cancer patients, included in tend to abandon analgesia mediated by rapid opioid exclusively and in doses absolutely larger than those recommended by their doctor, both in amount per dose and in frequency of them. In fact, this is out of the datasheet, as well as the performance of a pact of time and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy while eval- uating other alternatives that would allow an early withdraw of these drugs. In general, we can say that the incidence of overdose and iatrogenic controlled from our Pain Unit, but not when prescribed by other medical specialties, with less knowledge of the problem generated by the chronic use of opioids. The traditional in the 1970s The rate of failure and relapse in both cases was high due to the discomfort and distress that the patients experienced during the procedure. Therefore, in the 1980s, Loimer et al. (14) developed for the first time this process of detoxification with general anesthe- sia and intubation, based on Yale University publications (15) on ROD methods. From then, different researchers have been introduc- ing improvements and modifications to the ultra-ROD technique using methadone or buprenorphine treatment versus ROD and ultra-ROD have not been able to demonstrate the clear one be by the response patients the duration of the opioid withdrawal period (17).TABLE IV DOSES OF PROPOFOL USED Group A (n = 4) Group B (n = 2) Propofol in PC: - Pacient mg/kg/h - Pacient 2: 1,6 mg/kg/h100 M. J. PUJANTE TORTOSA ET AL. Rev. Soc.

It is known exactly by which mechanisms anesthetic expression of opioid withdrawal, but one of the explanations could be in the interference of these drugs with glutamate, which is closely associated with a noradrenergic hyperactivity that in part is behind the pathophysiology of the withdrawal syndrome (19). The efficacy results for ultra-ROD are not and, therefore, recommendations on their use are contro- versial. In a recent review published in 2015, ultra-ROD techniques are not recommended under general anes- thesia due to the registry of severe complications in the literature, including cardiac arrest and death (20,21). In a systematic review of 5 randomized studies, they conclude that its use is not advisable due to the lack of benefit and the potential documented risks and the high costs that in based on general anesthesia or deep sedation (22). Another point to discuss is the different drugs that we have used in the development of our ROD protocol. In opioid detoxification techniques through induction of general anesthesia, the use such as cloni- dine and used in a protocolized manner in intensive care unit. We describe below pharmacological reasons these drugs are effective, their indi- cation is out of the data sheet. Due to the high noradrenergic activity that or dexmedetomidine, has been successful in large number of published studies. Their main lim- itation the antihypertensive effect. Their in this activity, the reduction of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the decrease requirements described on the nucleus ceruleus. The 2 agonist drugs are usually combined with another type of drugs, which we also use in a protoco- lized way in our study. These drugs are benzodiazepines, in our case continuous perfusion (CP) nau- and and loperamide for the in patients with withdrawal syndrome.

These data are consistent with the find- ings observed in our study that, the size, withdrawal due to opioid deprivation lower use results on the treated patients us in the need to make the patient see: 1. The continued risk for relapse that patient will have throughout life. 2. That patient must inform the anesthesiologist immediately if he/she is going have and the health of the patient should be monitored.
