{"title": "Paris quadrifolia L. Trilliaceae Herb Paris Distribution: Europe and temperate Asia. This dramatic plant was known as Herb Paris or one-berry.

Prosaically, the name 'Paris' stems from the Latin 'pars' meaning 'parts' referring to the four equal leaves, and not to the French capital or the lover of Helen of Troy.
