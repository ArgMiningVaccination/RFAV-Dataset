In the 1990s, he said, he was a successful liver and pancreatic surgeon in Seattle, having done his fellowship in London at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital \u2014 a \"member of the elite club in medicine of practicing/teaching surgeons.\" But then he developed for pre-op disinfection. \"I would get a open sores,\" Bernhoft said. \"It ended my career as a surgeon set me on the path of environmental medicine.\" to perfumes, car exhaust and other chemicals in the environment. His experiences led him to retrain in allergy and environmental medicine and to question many of the assumptions of conventional Western medicine in terms of both theory and practice. As Bernhoft wrote on his [website](https://www.drbernhoft.com/dr-bernhofts-story): \"Increasingly, evidence suggests we thought, yet also simpler. It turns our genes are not destiny, merely suggestions. 'The genes cock the gun, but the environment the trigger.' \"The expression successfully defective genes can work better with the proper cofactors or with upgrading of backup enzymes. at the symptoms of chronic but money is better spent going after causes, as they do in Europe and Japan.\" In his recovery and in his practice, Bernhoft said he relies on a combination of treatments for to to chemicals. \"Low-dose antigen (LDA) treatment is the standard of care for all allergies in the UK and has had some impact in Europe,\" Bernhoft said. \"But it is not recognized World War,\" said Bernhoft, adding that in contrast, LDA treatment was introduced in the 1970s. He said: \"It's a more recent and far safer technology. The allergy shots that most American allergists serious side effects, including two dozen deaths in an average year. The LDA shots have few side effects and no recorded fatalities since 1973.\" Bernhoft said the issue for American allergists with the LDA approach is not one of efficacy or safety, but one of profit. \"The LDA shot is one shot every seven to eight weeks, whereas the typical course given by an American allergist or two shots per week,\" Bernhoft said. \"It's easy enough to do the math on the greater profits to be had with the approach.\" In fact, Bernhoft said the AAAAI successfully lobbied insurance companies to cover the standard regimen of weekly allergy shots but not to cover the far-less-expensive LDA MCS patients, for whom the standard allergy treatment offers no help, must pay out of pocket for the LDA treatment, while standard allergy patients (including those with dust and pollen allergies) must submit to the more expensive, more dangerous approach to receive medical treatment covered by their insurance, Bernhoft afflicted with MCS, this reporter can personally attest to the efficacy of the LDA Autism toxic exposure, of autism. In a [ 2008 paper](https://www.drbuttar.com/patientresources/autism/MultiSystem.pdf), Bernhoft and his colleague, Rashid Buttar, argued Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals paints a grim picture of maternal and fetal exposures to multiple chemicals and metals. \"A small study by Edelson and subjects had detoxification ability, as assessed usual excretory and 90% had high levels of many neurotoxic chemicals. In Edelson's earlier study, all the subjects also evidence of unusually high levels of heavy metals.\" \"Mercury has been suspected for some time to play a role in autism, in part because of and autism symptoms superimposed\" in Venn diagram. of exposure to these neurotoxic chemicals and heavy metals that cause autism,\" said Bernhoft. also pointed out while mercury supposedly was removed from all childhood vaccines, except for the flu vaccine, a lab analysis six years ago showed [thimerosal](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/child-health-topics/known-culprits/vaccines-culprit/poison-in-our-vaccines-investigating-mercury-thimerosal-and-neurodevelopmental-delay/) was found in several vaccines \"even though the patient's body. \"My clinical experience is that when you detox the mercury and other heavy metals from kids with autism, they do a lot better,\" Bernhoft said. He recounted his experience with one 4-year-old reported spoken since his autism diagnosis: \"We had chelated him for about a year, and one day he came into the office for treatment and he looked me in the eye [autistic children do not typically make eye contact] and said, 'Hi, Dr. Bernhoft! I am feeling a lot better.'\" Bernhoft has seen this sort of improvement replicated in many of his patients, including his own son. He [ published](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Mercury-Toxicity-and-Treatment%3A-A-Review-of-the-Bernhoft/dcb79de82c53236ecae2ed5bfbd55ccb81649d73) his the chelation and the sooner the detoxification protocol is begun, the greater the chance for improvement, as the toxins can be removed before damage. Bernhoft studied the genetic profile of children with autism. \"The study was published in 2008 but it has since been removed from the PubMed archives, as have two similar studies by university pediatric researchers,\" he said. Bernhoft's research found a high correlation between autism and some genetic abnormalities that make it difficult for the body \"So, it's a big deal [the genetic abnormality] and the irony of it is that if you did the genetic testing beforehand, you could weed out the kids that are going to become autistic and pretty much wipe out the disease, but that would be really bad for vaccine sales.\" COVID vaccines and treatment: 'Not that hard to make numbers say what you want them to say' In his interview with The Defender, Bernhoft also vitamin C mega-dose supplementation \u2014 have been suppressed in order to fast-track avoid a possible increased scrutiny in California of medical exemptions for vaccines in the wake of [ 2019 legislation](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276) that gave greater authority to the state medical board to review exemptions granted by physicians. \"In 2018 I wrote three medical exemptions \u2014 two for a history of anaphylactic reaction, and one for a patient with a history of [Guillain-Barr\u00e9](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/shelby-allen-teen-guillain-barre-covid-vaccine/) paralysis, which both are okay with the Centers Control and Prevention [as a rationale for exemptions] \u2014 but I am currently under an accusation from the California State Medical Board for having written these,\" he said. In \"safe and effective,\" Bernhoft recounted an incident in his own research career when the supervisor of his research simply removed some of the data from a study, telling him \"he didn't like those numbers.\" The result was completely different after the data were removed. \"It's not that hard to make the numbers say what you want them to say,\" said Bernhoft.
