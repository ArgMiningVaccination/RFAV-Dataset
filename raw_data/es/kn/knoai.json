[1](#bib0120) the terms brain or railway spine were coined, depending on whether the symptoms were mental or spinal. Two origins for these diseases were postulated at the time: one with an organic basis (Oppenheim) and one with a hysterical psychogenesis (Charcot and Page). [2](#bib0125) These traumatic neurosis, subjective syndrome, war neurosis, etc., and all of them have one thing in common: re-experiencing a was another psychological illness that appeared secondarily to the precedent, seems easier to categorise. described above have been placed in different categories. On the other hand, the development of a system to compensate for accidents is important. This occurred due to the increase in the transport of people and goods throughout the 19th century. In 1861 The Lancet [3](#bib0130) stated that railway safety was a medical problem in terms of the prevention of accidents. At the widely that the sensible opinion of one of them was preferable to the highly scientific opinion of another. [4](#bib0135) Throughout the 20th century and especially the second half of the same, scales were established in different countries to homogenise the of obliging doctors to use a common language. [5](#bib0140) For posttraumatic symptoms this led to prepare scales that have either not lasted over time or are not in general use in different countries such as France, Belgium and Spain, and there was even an attempt at a scale for the European Union. [6-10](#bib0145) The non-existence of scales that have been agreed and maintained over time gives us an idea of the lack of agreement between authors in this field, and there are still few regulated studies of this public health problem. [11](#bib0170) of a are lead to an important burden of long-term disability. This is as slight or severe trauma affect millions of people around the world. [12](#bib0175) The prevalence of PPP is estimated to stand at from 28% to 31% in the period from 12 to 72 months after trauma, [11,12](#bib0170) which agrees with the prevalence seems cause of the trauma. [14](#bib0185) According to official statistics, in 2015 there were 97,756 with victims in Spain, with were to injuries. [16](#bib0195) This number of victims are the people who may potentially suffer PPP, giving rise to the need to evaluate psychological damage for the purpose of currently no scale at European or national level that has been validated. [17](#bib0200) In Spain the medical scale used to evaluate PPP is the one contained in Law 35/2015, of 22 September, on damages and prejudice caused to individual by traffic accidents. This is so regardless of the nature of the traumatic event. Although a new scale was published in 2015 [18](#bib0205) with some improvements over the previous one of 2004, [19](#bib0210) it is still, from the viewpoint of PPP, an incomplete element that does not fit with the considerations of international classifications. Nor does it consider the limitations functionality scores 1-5 cause it scores 71-80 criteria of the nine described in the DSM-5 or five of the seven of the CIE-10\"; it requires continuous medical or psychological monitoring by a psychiatric facility: 16-25 points. This sequela is seen as so limiting from a functional point-of-view that the possible need for a third person is included, i.e., the scale itself considers that the isolated at home, require supervision and care, and that their personal/family life will be very poor. On the contrary, for an important physical sequela such as the amputation of a loss of functionality is estimated to score 45-50 points. We know that with suitable instruments these individuals are able to enjoy a sufficiently integrated l family, social and work life. There is no reason for this differentiation apart from the origin of the sequelae, either psychiatric or physical, and this medical discrimination is unjustified. The problems which arise from using the new 2015 scale are similar those which we described before in another article on the 2004 scale, [17](#bib0200) and which can be summarised as: - 1 nomenclature used does not terms used any other diagnoses, and this makes it necessary to use the concept of an \"analogy\", which always leads to difficulties in interpretation. Additionally, a novelty in (post-concussion personality disorder) to the of Neurology. Specifically, the relevant, given and their corresponding updates must be fulfilled\"), so that it thereby fails to comply with what it proposes. - 2 The diagnostic criteria of the scale differ from the ones used in international classifications for it depressive the reason for this variation, although it is possible that it is an attempt to be more demanding restrictive when diagnosing 3 Psychiatric sequelae score very low in comparison with physical ones. At the same or even of functional limitation, psychiatric limitations score lower than physical ones, even when the law states that this is the factor that should be evaluated to score sequelae. - 4 There tendency subjectivity the evaluation of sequelae a score. This is the aspect that has been worked on the most in comparison with the A modern scale should be as scientific and objective as possible, and this is why we proposed using the formula to facilitate objective evaluation. The treatment and follow-up criterion. This indicates the need for treatment stress and chronic a wait of 11 years, little progress has been made. The new scale still expresses the underlying idea that psychology objective and should therefore have minimum scores. We believe that nothing could be further from the truth. Psychiatry is a science that is able to detect and quantify symptoms. You only have to look for them and distinguish what is essential from simulation. Once this has been done, the causal relationship has to be established with the traumatic event, before sequelae should be treated same functional limitation should have similar scores for sequelae. Due to all of this, and considering that in quantitative terms this is an important problem, and given the major repercussions that the situation we describe has on patients with PPP, as well as its quantitative and qualitative importance, we believe that a scale should be prepared that corresponds to the reality of psychiatry as it is understood by international classifications. express functional nature on mere suspicions that lack credibility. turn be developed by psychiatric professionals without having to wait for 11 more years to continue with an unjust system that lacks objectivity. PPP peculiarities and cannot be guided hundred percent by the same standards as somatic disease. An example of this is the correction contained in Royal Decree complete system for evaluating mental disorders only 2 months after the system had been published in the Official State Bulletin. We therefore understand the Guija JA, Giner L, Medina A, Giner J. \u00bfEs necesario un baremo de secuelas "}
