There are now vaccines exclusively designed for adults and others that are applied in early life but need to be updated later in life. Vaccines for adults are not only based on their respective age group but are also linked risk factors like occupation, life style, among others. At the same time, longevity brings with it a weakening of challenge to adequately protect this age group. For some time, WHO has been promoting the term \"Vaccination through the life course\" allow - ing for an extension of the vaccination vision and taking adults as an integral part into the national vaccination calendars. There are several vaccine preventable diseases adults, but those associated with influenza virus and pneumococcus are the ones that affect the largest herpes zoster, human papilloma others. There are still many challenges to overcome in order to fully include adults, particularly personnel, and to make vaccines ex - tensively valued as a prevention tool in order to life. : vaccines, preventable diseases, immunization programs, adult, elderly Resumen Vacunas en adultos. La proporci\u00f3n de poblaci\u00f3n de adultos se ha incrementado globalmente y las proyecciones muestran que para el a\u00f1o 2050 los mayores de 60 a\u00f1os representar\u00e1n el 21.1%. Actualmente se dispone de vacunas dirigidas exclusivamente a adultos y otras que se aplican en ni\u00f1os pero que se deben actualizar a lo largo de la vida. Las vacunas en adultos se administran, no solo por el grupo de edad al que pertenecen, sino tambi\u00e9n por factores como ocupaci\u00f3n, estilos de vida o estado de salud. Al mismo tiempo, la longevidad disminuye la respuesta inmune a las vacunas por el fen\u00f3meno de inmunosenescencia, lo cual representa un desaf\u00edo para proteger adecuadamente a este grupo. Desde hace varios a\u00f1os la OMS, ha propiciado la utilizaci\u00f3n del t\u00e9rmino \"Vacunaci\u00f3n en el curso de la vida\" lo cual permite extender la visi\u00f3n de la vacunaci\u00f3n y considerar al adulto como una parte integral de los planes y calendarios de inmunizaci\u00f3n. Existen varias enfermedades prevenibles por vacunas en adultos, pero aquellas asociadas al virus de influenza y al neumococo, son las que comprenden el grupo m\u00e1s extenso. Diversas recomendaciones incluyen, adem\u00e1s de estas vacunas, otras dirigidas a prevenir difteria, t\u00e9tanos, tos convulsa, hepatitis A y B, parotiditis, herpes z\u00f3ster, virus del papiloma humano y otras enfermedades. Se reconocen muchos desaf\u00edos a superar para poder incorporar plenamente al adulto, incluyendo al personal de salud, y lograr que la vacunaci\u00f3n sea una herramienta de prevenci\u00f3n valorada ampliamente para el desarrollo de una vida saludable.

Quintana 494 7 A, 1129 Buenos Aires, Argentina e-mail: rosesperiago@hotmail.comAdults at any age are exposed to diverse infectious diseases which are vaccine preventable. The risk of be - ing affected by some of these diseases and the recom - mendations to be vaccinated to them depends their made pos - sible to produce several vaccines for adult use, a group age not considered previously as a target, defining now a more complex scenario for better prevention in these group. There is a low risk perception among those in these age group, since they are the survivors of child diseases; also, because most of now in communities and countries under the poverty line. These are some of the determinants for the low global coverage of adults, includ - ing health personnel10-13.VACCINES the top segment of accelerated population growth. The proportion of people > 60 years increased from 9.2% in 1990 to 12.7% in 2015 and will reach 21.1% in 2050, being the growth even more ac - celerated in low income countries. Longevity suffering diseases or being vaccinated14. Immunosenescence a natural ageing pro - cess of the immunological system and may aggravated by diseases, emotional stress, malnutrition, and other factors. Due to a reduced production of hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow and the decreasing renewal potential of the mother cells, rapid immune response is compromised15. Epithelial virus protein antigens high levels, as well as TCD8. Inactivated virus vaccines only induce high level of antibodies. That is why older adults produce low antibod - ies level to influenza, hepatitis B, diphtheria and of intramuscular, use of adjuvants and conjugated vaccines18-22. In 1989, the World Health Assembly called to elimi - nate neonatal tetanus by 1995, launching the pregnant women vaccination. By the end of the 90s, due to measles outbreaks in adults, adolescents and young adults were included in mass campaigns, and, at the same time, older people started to receive seasonal flu vaccines annually. Little with comor - bidities began more severe in the extremes of life, being pneumococcus and influenza virus the two main causes23-28. There are several new vaccines under development, like respiratory syncytial virus and others containing new immunogens, that are more effective or use new technolo - gies, like the inactivated vaccine against herpes zoster. It is increasingly more important, for the scientific community as well as for the entire society, to know more about the wide spectrum of available vaccines for adults, and to use them in an optimal and rational way, in order to be able to reduce the morbimortality from these diseases, reduce health costs and improve quality of life. There are several evidence-based recommendations at international, regional and local level for adults9-12. Usually the varicella, measles/rubella/mumps (triple viral), herpes zoster, human papilloma virus and others, i.e. people in risk or endemic areas Argentinian hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever1-3, 22-25. Diphtheria It has recently reemerged in the Americas with in Haiti, and Venezuela; of them, dose during the life course, instead double burden caused by is of age17, 26, 27. Also recommended is dTpa vaccine in the last trimester of pregnancy in order to transfer antibodies from mother to child, close to delivery, generating high impact on morbimortality of newborns and under 6 months old28. Health workers caregiv ers in nant to minor antigen changes in the virus, each year the com - position of the vaccine is updated on two occasions, in February in the northern in subtypes influenza A (H1N1 y H3N2) and one lineage of virus B (Victoria or Yamagata). Vaccine effectiveness to prevent non-complicated flu in adults over 60 years is around 70%, while in adults older than 60 years, effec - tiveness is lower, not more than 53%. For this age group, the use of inactivated trivalent flu vaccine is associated with a decrease in pneumonia hospitalizations between 32% and 45%, in hospital mortality due to pneumonia and MEDICINA - Volumen 79 - N\u00b0 6/1 - N\u00daMERO ESPECIAL 80 ANIVERSARIO, 2019554 flu between 31% and 65% and for respiratory diseases between 43% and 50%, while reducing mortality for all causes between 27% and 30%18. In pregnant women the inactivated trivalent flu vaccine reduces flu like diseases by 36% with an effectiveness of 63% reduction of flu cases in under 6 months old children29. For the more frequent comorbidities, like with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes, the flu vaccine has been proven to reduce the risk of complications like a new acute heart attack or hospitalization rates in diabetics, during the virus circulation season30. One the challenges for flu vaccine is to achieve higher efficacy in adults over 60, the group suffering higher doses of antigens (60 micrograms instead of current 15 micrograms) have been proven to increase efficacy and effectiveness in these age group by around 25%19. Since 2013, and due to antigenic differences in the two circulating virus B lineages and the virus impact on flu dis - ease, WHO recommended the development a superior for B components and similar for the other strains, in children as well as in adolescents, young adults Other available for adults are the one pro - duced with recombinant DNA technology and those cellular line-based. The first one avoids mutations or ad - suffered by during replication in embryonated eggs and is faster to produce. This vac - cine was first developed as trivalent, but now is available as quadrivalent, contains 45 micrograms each one more volume and faster production. Some are already approved in Europe and the USA for use in adults40. Pneumonia Invasive pneumococcal disease, seen in adults. Since the 80s the anti - pneumococcic vaccine with 23 polysaccharides (PPSV23) containing serotypes - for invasive capsular and produces a response independent of T cells, therefore, not immuno - genic in under 2 years old. adults to attenuate the severity, without evidence yet that it serves to prevent occur - rence16, 41. The most recent pneumococci with a transporter protein, initially 7 later on 11 allowed for a T cell dependent immune response with efficacy in under 2 years old for the prevention of invasive forms, pneumonia and middle otitis reduce 18C, 19A, 19F better immunogenic response for most of the serotypes they both share, better response when PCV13 is administered first if they are both administered. This vaccine has shown efficacy close to 50% to prevent CAP due to serotypes included in the vaccine, in a randomized double-blind study compared with placebo in older with data effectiveness of PPSV23 herd due pediatric vaccination, there is no yet consensus or uniformity in the recommendations about use of antipneumococcal vaccines in adults at international level. As an example, the PAHO TAG Vaccines (Techni - cal scheme including both vaccines PCV13 y PPSV2342. The Ministry of Health of Argentina has adopted this same scheme in 2017 and, in both cases, evaluate the impact of pediatric vaccination on national committee for has advised to use only PPSV23 in adults over 60 and revaccination every 6 years41. There are new conjugated vaccines under develop - ment with 15 and 20 serotypes to allow for an extension of protection. Hopefully there will be more and better data to establish more clearly the best alternative to protect against invasive forms in older adults and those with comorbidities and from CAP which is the most frequent in these population groups (Table Vaccine 17-64 years 65 years 1 dose every 10 years in all adults 1 dose to one vaccine) in adults with risk conditions, pregnant women and health care workers 1 or 2 doses in adults with risk conditions 1 dose in adults with risk conditions 3 doses in transplant and HIV infected men and women up to 26 years In women, based on individualized indication, can be administered without age limit 3 doses (0, 1 and 6 m) for all susceptible adults 2 doses (0, 6 to 12 m) in susceptible adults, particularly in those with occupational risk or based on life style 1 or 2 doses (revaccinate with 1 MenACWY dose every 5 years if the risk remains) in adults with risk of severe diseases or increased closed communities) 1 dose in travelers or those who live in risk areas 1 dose for those aged 15 to 65 years who live in risk areas No available for 50 years 1 or 2 doses 2 doses in susceptible young adults, particularly non-pregnant women in childbearing age, health care workers, individuals under high risk of exposure and within 72 h after contact with a varicella patient 1 dose if there is risk of exposure (revaccinate every 3 years if the risk remains) 1 dose (anatomic of all adults 65 years 1 dose in all adults 65 years 1 dose in all adults 65 years Assess risk/benefit ( 60 1 dose (live zoster vaccine) 2 doses (recombinant zoster vaccine).

The first vaccine was composed of live attenuated virus, with the same strain as vari - cella, but in higher concentration. This is administered in one only subcutaneous dose in adults over 50, with a demonstrated efficacy of 51.3% to prevent occurrence of herpes of 66.5% prevent be in two intramuscular doses in space of 2 months, has demonstrated an over 90% efficacy to prevent herpes and 88% to tick born encephalitis49. Conclusions with a WHO initiative, the use of \"Vaccination though the life course\" has expanded the use of vac - cines from the beginning to the end of life. This strategy allows to expand the vision of vaccination and to include the adults as an integral part of vaccinations plans and programs and into immunization calendars. There are still many challenges to overcome in order to fully in - clude adults and to be able to make challenges are: insufficient information and medi - cal knowledge on prevention through immunization, the huge amount of preventive recommendations that leave vaccines out, the lack of acknowledgement of adults on this matter, the fear of adverse reactions, myths against vaccines and uncertainty about their real efficacy, bar - riers to access since most of vaccination services and centers are only prepared for pediatric care, lack of op - portunities for vaccination in the health systems and in the resource allocation.
