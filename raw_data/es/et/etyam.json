J. A. DelgadilloRuano, C. RamosRemus, G\u00f3mezVargas, of liquid inside the joints been the proximal cause of rheumatic diseases since humoral evacuating the excess the abnormal target of all therapeutic measures taken during this era, no mention of arthrocentesis is found in Occidental medical texts until 1652. We present two earlier indications of treat abnormal accumulation of liquid Badianus, an Aztec manuscript written in the 16th century, and the other in the Tractado breve de medicina, published in Mexico in 1592. In the treatise 'on joints', the Corpus Hippocraticum is recognized as the mention of the existence of liquid inside the joints [ [1](javascript:;)]. As Greek medicine flourished in the Mediterranean zone, the humoral theory was the dominant paradigm in Occidental medicine. Under this theory, the human body was considered as a blend of at least four different humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. A healthy state was the equilibrium between the different humours, a eucrasy, and the disequilibrium was a diseased state, a discrasy. This disequilibrium could be an excess of a specific humour in all the body, or the accumulation of a specific humour in a closed compartment. Each humour was associated with one of the four basic elements. Blood represented air, yellow bile represented fire, [2](javascript:;)]. The influence of one predominated above the others to define the personality and the disease processes to which each person was exposed during his life [ [3](javascript:;)]. The main therapies were directed to the redistribution humours in the joints. rheumatic diseases were classified as different kinds of gout [ [4](javascript:;)]. The precise nature of this fluid was not known, although it was recognized that this cause of severe pain and permanent dysfunction. It could be due to any of the four humours, but the direct evacuation by puncture of swollen joints the liquid inside the joints (aqua articulorum) in 1565, while explaining the causation of gout by tartarum, but without mention direct of Hildanus (1560-1634), surgeon, seems to have been the first to puncture a pyarthrosis due to a previous open wound in the knee [ [10](javascript:;)]. He described how he entered an abscess that was visible through the open wound a probe. Although the patient of the afflicted joint. This intervention, published after the death of the author, did not influence the management of similar cases in subsequent centuries. We have found no mention of therapeutic is Jean Gay reported his the intraarticular injection of medication in two patients in 1792, in France. After the evacuation of clinical improvement in both. Unfortunately, we are not aware of the later experiences of this physician, nor of the intellectual influences on which he based his decision to puncture the joint [ [11](javascript:;)]. This did not become standard practice until the 20th century, although the precise time when the practice was accepted is not clear. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n 1947 Von Reis Swenson [ [12a](javascript:;)] proposed the use of intraarticular osmic acid to produce a chemical synovectomy his publication that arthrocentesis has become a standard practice restore function [ [16](javascript:;)]. Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan through direct interviews with the surviving Aztec nobility in M\u00e9xico city in the 16th century. Another mention of an evacuating articular puncture in 1552 and translated into Latin by Juan Badiano [ [17](javascript:;)] (Fig. 1 [). He was a pure aboriginal who studied in the Colegio de Santiago de Tlatelolco, where Franciscan friars taught Latin after the Spanish conquest [](javascript:;) [18](javascript:;)]. Originally written as a gift for King Charles V of Spain, it was presented to Prince Philip, the future Philip II of Spain. Not intended as a medical text, it is a sort of catalogue registering some of the herbal remedies and therapeutic measures employed in Aztec medical practice. Rediscovered in 1929 in the Vatican Library [ [19](javascript:;)], it was finally published in 1939 [ [17](javascript:;), [20](javascript:;), [21](javascript:;)]. In Chapter 9 (Fig. 1 [), while talking about joint diseases, it mentions that the rigid joint must be punctured with the bone of an eagle or a lion, after which a cataplasm made with honey and several herbs and insects applied. the puncture should not be performed if the joint is not severely painful.](javascript:;) Contra el dolor de las articulaciones cienpi\u00e9s, y todo se muele y cuece en agua. Adem\u00e1s, la parte que est\u00e1 entorpecida por la rigidez tiene que ser punzada con un hueso de \u00e1guila o de le\u00f3n, y luego poner la cataplasma dicha, mezclada con miel. Cuando el artr\u00edtico, o paciente de dolor articular, no siente tan gran dolencia, no hay necesidad de punzarle la parte enferma. These descriptions were made when no important exchange theories and treatments had occurred between European and Nahuatl physicians. So, it that the presence of synovial fluid recorded both continents. yolk, descriptions is mentioned as the fluid obtained from cactus. Hens came to M\u00e9xico with the Spanish conquest [ [22](javascript:;)]. Fray Agust\u00edn Farf\u00e1n published the second edition of the Tractado breve de medicina in 1592, in M\u00e9xico (Fig. 2 [) [](javascript:;) [23](javascript:;)]. In the second book he describes for the first time in an Occidental medical text, the precise indications and benefits of performing an arthrocentesis and In accordance with the humoral theory, first suggests the use of cathartics and poultices. Should they be ineffective, then the by puncturing the point of swollen with a thin cautery and immediately evacuating the contents in a gentle manner. Muchas veces he visto unas hinchazones, que se hacen en las rodillas, y estas son muy penosas, y causan muy gran dolor. ... Si viniere la hinchaz\u00f3n a madurar, como las he visto muchas veces, y aunque por estar en juntura son peligrosas todas las hinchazones que se abren, sanan, si con cuidado las curan, hagan la cura de esta manera; abran la con cauterio sutil, por la parte m\u00e1s baja y no aguarden a que del todo est\u00e9 tan madura, que la materia vaya comiendo la carne buena. Saquen (sin lastimar) de una vez la materia, y no la dejen para otro d\u00eda... In case of an increase in pain or should there be fever, the third line of treatment was bleeding the patient on the arm, on the same side as the swollen joint. Although rheumatic have found no similar prescription in several medical texts published in Mexico at the same time [ [24](javascript:;), [25](javascript:;)]. Unfortunately, it seems that the utility was not recognized, as no further mention is found in medical books published in Mexico in subsequent centuries [ [26](javascript:;)- [28](javascript:;)]. Of the mentioned texts written the New only Farf\u00e1n's book had an extensive distribution. Sahag\u00fan's writings were not published until 1829 [ [29](javascript:;)] and we have already mentioned a brief history of Codex Badiano. Unfortunately, medical books written in languages other than those of current use in central Europe were seldom employed as reference in mainstream medical theories. This is one thing that the modern globalization process must change.
