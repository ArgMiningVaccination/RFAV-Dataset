Once someone the allyship are also key. Michael Green, a Black chemist and senior principal scientist at Pfizer, feels valued and accepted in his current role, but as a younger student he often felt mindset used to be: \"I have to be the best at everything to show that I belong,\" he recalls.

Over the year, C&EN BrandLab shared a weekly post about a phenomenal Black chemist representing a diverse mix of career stages and geographic locations. Now we are sharing their stories here in the pages of C&EN to allow our broad audience of chemistry enthusiasts to celebrate the contributions of Black chemists to science. "}
