In Europe, I. ricinus is the main vector2,3. Much of the clinical spectrum LB, such called Banwarth\u00b4s syndrome had already been described in Europe since the late XIX and early XX centuries. In addition, its bacterial etiology and been This infection, aroused great medical and social interest as a result of the description in the US in the 70s 4,5 and of the discovery of its etiological agent in the 80s6, with gradual increase in be easy by infection, such as EM, in an endemic area for LB. But, sometimes, and despite the fact that there are other clinical manifestations suggestive of LB (e.g. meningorradiculitis and lymphocytic facial nerve paralysis), these manifestations may be by tick which can often go unnoticed because it is the environment, can lead to confusion and misdiagnosis. For many years, and this is still the case for most Public Network Centres in Spain, the microbiological criter ia recommended by Health and the (e.g. Centers applied 10-19. But in recent years, 'other techniques' that have been validated by these Agencies and Societies have appeared, leading to the diagnosis in without clear epidemiological and clinical criteria. In the opinion of many experts, and this is reflected in most clinical guidelines and consensus documents, many meeting diagnosis, is to differentiate an active infection from a past infection, and the high prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in endemic areas22. To complicate the the literature includes cases of B. burgdorferi be after an initial period of detection 12,23. The the above- mentioned reasons and taking into account that every day it is more frequent that we are consulted by patients w ho have been diagnosed of LB meeting required clinical to prolonged treatments not based on scientific evidence, the Society Infectious Diseases and Clini cal Microbiology (SEIMC) has considered the need to update and prepare a Consensus Document with other Scientific Societies such as the Spanish Society of Neurology (SEN), Spanish Society of Pediatric Infectology (SEIP), Spanish Society of Rheumatology (SE R), Spanish Society of Immunology (SEI) and Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV) involved in the diagnosis and management of the LB. 2. METHODOLOGY FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE DOCUMENT After contacting with the different Spanish Scientific Societies and experts in the field, and with the aim already proposed of agreeing on some useful recommendations for of patients by LB, an exhaustive bibliographic search was pr oposed on the state of knowledge of the infection by B. burgdorferi s.l. and LB in PubMed. Given that the bibliographic search with the Scientific Societies and relevant abstract books of Conferences. As in Spain there are none wide and updated reviews of the topic, considered carry out an exhaustive review about the epidemiology and history of LB in Spain. Since available guidelines and consensus documents have been recently published and they can be easily consulted 13-19, in our case, we have chosen to use the degree of consensus between Societies and experts' signatories of this document final 3. OF Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. AND GENOSPECIES IN SPAIN Bacteria of the genus Borrelia , along with the genera Spirochaeta, fall within the Phylum XV Spirochaetes phyl nov., Class I Spirochaetia class. nov., Order I Spirochaetales and Family I Spirochaetaceae, and comprise 43 pathogenic species characteristic spiral shape with size between 0.2 and 0.5 m in diameter and between 3 and 33 m in length. They an external cell envelope, a cytoplasmic cylinder. The flagella fulfill the functions of skeleton and mobility and are subproximally anchored in the bacterial body, and are located in the periplasmic space. They are Gram - negative and microaerophilic bacteria. According to the analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and other conserved genes such as the flagelline gene, and considering the ecological characteristics, Borrelia spp. are divided into two large groups, B. burgdorferi s.l. comprising the bacteria that cause LB, and a second large group of bacteria that cause recurrent fever 25. A striking feature of B. burgdorferi s.l. is the small size and structure of its genome. This is composed of a linear chromosome, unusual of approximately Mb plasmids, linear and circular, which vary in number up to 21. The guanine- cytosine ratio ranges from 23% to 32%. Another characteristic is the large number of lipoproteins that it expresses, and that are mostly encoded by OspF) and important role pa tient's immune response. There these bacteria into obligated parasites that depend on their hosts for their nutritional support. However, the borrelias of this called Barbour 30 -34 \u00b0C in microaerophilic environment, dividing every 8- 12 h during the Although the complex currently comprises 21 different their description is occasional. Borrelia mayonii has been recently incorporated in the Americas26. There seems to be a tropism of different B. bavariensis seem to present greater tropism by the nervous system, B. burgdorferi s.s. by the articular system, while B. spielmanii has been isolated exclusively from EM. Anyway, LB is a dynamic process with different clinical manifestations in different organs and systems, depending not only on genospecies, but also in recent years. Some argue that genospecies more than genetic variations same while others criticize that genetic classification is not relevant in many cases from an ecological point of view. In 2014, Adeulu and Gupta proposed the reclassification of spirochaetals of the Borrelia so that those that cause LB ( B. burgdorferi s.l. complex) would be renamed cause results of their 'unique' in the 27. Recently, detractors of this new classification have asked the Judicial Commission to support the rejection of the name 'Borreliella' and all its combinations, based on the violation of several principles of as, among others: endangering by the confusion they create in the medic al and scientific its possible consequences on medical coverage, be changed without sufficient justified reasons 28. This controversy has led to the non-adoption of the new nomenclature in most published works since its proposal, adding more confusion to the chaos that this has caused.

FEATURES OF Ixodes ricinus The first confirmed LB patients in Spain date back to the 1980s when the first cases of neuroborreliosis and EM were described 29-31. Subsequently, other either spectrum of clinical manifestations and making clear that the LB is common in Spain, affecting children and adults of both genders. Most cases have been reported in the northern half of the Iberian Peninsula. In addition to the description of clinical cases, studies of seroprevalence of antibodies were carried out different population groups showing that antibodies can be found in a high percentage. The risk of infection also increases with seroprevalence technique 22,41- 53 2). However, since LB is not a notifiable disease in our country, we do not have records or reliable data on the incidence of this disease. Most patients are diagnosed by physicians in the event of an EM or suspicion of clinical manifestations with nervous system involvement. In Europe, according to data from 2006 (latest WHO update), 85,000 cases are reported annually; these being clearly lower than the real data, as it is not a notifiable disease 54. There are other estimations between 60,000 and more than 200,000 cases per year, only in Germany55.

In 1998, Oteo et al. isolated the first pathogenic B. burgdorferi strain in Spain, corresponding to B. garinii (RIOJA -1 strain), from a patient with an EM from La Rioja74, and given the description of LB cases with clinical not- defining of a definition of 'endemic area' to support the diagnosis75. In Spain, the number of diagnosed cases decreases from North to South with areas considered endemic, such as La Rioja, Navarra, North of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Countr y and more recently, Galicia, where in the last decade a progressive increase in the number of reported cases has been observed20,76- 78. As already noted, in the Iberian Peninsula, as in the rest of Europe, LB is transmitted to humans by the bite of hard t icks : Patient bitten by an adult female (A) and a nymph (B) of Ixodes ricinus. Note concomitant presence of erythema surrounding tick caused particularly in its nymph stage, is the one that most frequently bites people in northern Spain 79. I. ricinus is In Spain, I. ricinus has been described not only as vector of B. burgdorferi s.l. (mainly, B. garinii and B. afzelii) but also is the of the TBE virus, it has not been notified in Spain up to date89,90, and only imported cases have been detected. I. ricinus generally In figure 1, a female I. ricinus can be seen waiting for a host. In figure 3 the different stages of the tick and their sizes are detailed. They prefer areas with litter cover on the ground that provide protection against drought in summer and cold in winter, creating a humid microclimate. In rainy areas, it ticks in forests connected acts amplifiers as well as wild fauna (micromammals), which act as reservoirs 91. They can also live in urban and peri-urban environments. In areas such as La Rioja or Navarra, I. ricinus habitually lives in areas with a minimum altitude of 400 m and a maximum of 1,200 -1,300 m. However, in western areas with the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and higher humidity, I. ricinus can be found from sea level to 2,000 m of altitude. In southern Spain, there are also areas where there are stable populations of I. ricinus , such as the `Parque de los Alcornocales\u00b4 in Cadiz, and the 'Do\u00f1ana National Park'20,92. In the last decade, the distribution of I. ricinus (and the pathogens it transmits) greater abundance of I. ricinus , parallel to an expansion of its reservoirs and hosts. These factors and the phenomena of contact between ticks (co- feeding) seem to be responsible for the local variations in the prevalence of the different Borrelia spp. (and other microorganisms) in ticks96. I. ricinus are mainly active from spring to autumn, although we can find them active throughout the year depending on the above. Activity in spring autumn (associated with higher temperature and photoperiod) with the exception of larvae, which show the opposite situation in burgdorferi in Spain57, 65, although no cases of LB associated with their bites, which are rare in humans, have been reported. 5. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS and pathophysiological changes caused by the causative bacteria. As it is a dynamic process over time, it has been classified into different phases stages2 as we have reviewed the state of the knowledge of LB clinical manifestations according to the organ or system affected. 5.1. Skin manifestations The skin manifestations are the most frequent and best documented, and can appear during all phases of the infection. The first descriptions date from the end of the 19th century in Europe ( Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans - Buchwald 1983)99 benigna burgdorferi, were added101. typical clinical marker of LB in both, North America and Europe, is EM102,103. It is characterized by the development of a small erythematous macule at the point of the tick bite, which grows at the border and typically a erythema migrans (EM) with annular appearance on leg. B) Large EM of more than 6 weeks of evolution. C) EM without the typical annular appearance. D) EM in the If borders 4B ). It appears a few days to 2- 3 weeks after the bite and without treatment, it can take many weeks or months to disappear. This is the early localized phase of the infection. In some patients, the bacteria spread through t he skin through the lymphatic vessels and lesions or appearance (Figure 4D). This is what we call multiple EM and corresponds to the early skin disseminated phase of the B. burgdorferi infection. EM although some patients report a certain stinging- itch in the area. The border of the lesion is usually sharp, unlike other cellulites. The clinical presentation of EM in children is similar than in adults, although EM is more commonly localized on the head or neck that in adults104. A variable percentage of patients with EM have arthromyalgia, low -grade fever and conjunctivitis55,103,104. The presence of fever and severe impairment of the general state, with or without other clinical manifestations or changes in blood parameters, should alert a possible co -infection by other agents transmitted by I. diagnosis of EM in our environment rioja, since when this infection is located outside the head, an EM-like appears In travelers returning from certain US areas, it can be very difficult to distinguish between EM and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) 106.

This rare manifestation on the It as a painless red nodule at the point of the tick -bite or at a distance t hat appears within weeks of contracting the infection.

ACA is accompanied by a polyneuropathy in up to 50% of cases55,109. These three manifestations are clearly related to an fibrous cord on the arm. ACA affecting low extremities (C) and an arm with a fibrotic nodule (D). 5.2. Neurologic manifestations The involvement of the central and peripheral and PNS) in the neurological manifestations in Europe and the US appear to be different in some aspects113-115. Lyme Neuroborreliosis is divided between early and late manifestations of signs and symptoms for more than in isolation or in combination, and the typical skin lesion (EM) or the combined with uni - palsy disc. The presentation in the periods of activity of I. ricinus as well as a history of tick exposure and a skin lesion compatible with an EM should alert to the clinicians. Two recent retrospective studies in and common neurological disorder was radiculitis, present in 66% and 50% of patients, respectively, facial palsy in 43% and 25%, and meningitis in 10% and 6% 113,114. Aside from radiculitis, patients with In the US and Europe, facial palsy and lymphocytic meningitis are the most common early manifestations. Headache is the main complaint in meningitis, and fever and meningismus may be mild or absent. In untreated patients, recurre nt attacks of meningitis may alternate with periods of remission. CSF analysis shows stroke, likely secondary infective endarteritis, in a similar way as it occurs in syphilis or tuberculosis. A few in Lyme with adult cases reported 111,112. 5.2.2. Late neuroborreliosis: This condition is much and may present disease. Late CNS may appear months to initially known all Lyme neuroborreliosis), it It disease lasting more than 6 months and its diagnosis can be only made in the presence of suggestive and bladder dysfunction. the CSF shows pleocytosis (usually cells/mm In fact, its importance has been reflected in the history of LB itself, which in the first descriptions in the US was called 'Lyme arthritis' (LA)5. The prevalence of the joint and manifestations is more frequent depending on the geographical area since the clinical spectrum is different between the American continent and Europe. 5.3.1. Arthritis In Europe, oligoarticular frequent than in the and in this arthritis is rarely antibiotic therapy and autoimmune mechanisms. In the US, more than 10% of LA cases are resistant to treatment and associated to autoimmune mechanisms3,20,102. In Spain, reports of the classic form of LA are rare, probably related to the f act that B. garinii is the most frequent genospecies causing LB in Spain. as it occurs with the cutaneous and neurological manifestations of LB, in Spain it is more frequent to diagnose this type of manifestations in north- western According serology results in urban areas, the prevalence of LA was very low (6 cases out of 78 positive serologies from 574 samples)125. In the natural history of the disease, up to 45-62% of patients with untreated EM develop LA characterized as can intermittent or persistent, frequently affecting the knee joint, although it can present as an asymmetric oligoarthritis1-5,125. In a study carried out from 2010 to 2016 in France, Borrelia was detected in 37 out of 357 (10.4%) synovial fluids tested PCR. 6-78) with 61% of men and 28% patients under 18. The presentation was monoarticular in 92% and the knee was involved in 97%. Contrary to the Borrelia genospecies distribution prevalent in synovial fluid (54%) followed by B. ankle, elbow, temporo- that begin acutely, can last from weeks to months, being much more frequent in untreated patients. It is and pressured is characterized by proliferative synovitis 2 after oral antibiotics or month after, at least, two weeks of intravenous antibiotics, which may lead to and synovial fluids reveals an inflammatory process focus the clinical picture of such arthritis and seek for LB. The serological response to B. burgdorferi is the main diagnostic test, but occasionally seroconversion does not occur until a infec tion. Patients with arthritis occurring in are usually seropositive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi . The outcome of patients with early LB covers from a stage of full recovery to the development of rheumatoid sig ns migratory type recurrent arthralgia is very frequent in early stages (50- 75%), and they are also present in patients in late stages of the infection14. They are unspecific, overlapping through the infectious the disease such of LB can be observed in the early disseminated and late stages of infection, their communication less or joint manifestations. This is cases, B. burgdorferi only causes self -limited atrioventricular conduction blocks (AV -B) cause clinical manifestations or do so temporarily. According to the CDC, involvement occurs in only 1.1% of reported LB cases and it is more common in men in USA 131, although a study carried out in New York city with children suffering LB without symptoms of carditis, showed to 29%, most frequently AV-B grade I 132. In Germany, it can be found in up to 10% of patients133. There are no data of prevalence in Spain, although members of this panel have observed AV -B I to III) or supraventricular and ventricular rhythm disturbances, pericarditis, myocarditis, and pancarditis in single cases that can be cause of cardiac failure and sudden death134. Usually these patients spontaneously 3 by positive serology and always reported. Seropositivity and control of its specificity by western -blot (WB) are indicative but no proof. recently guidelines19, ECG should stage of borreliosis138. In some cases, these ophthalmological These ophthalmological manifestations are they do not require investigation of B. burgdorferi infection without a clear clinical- epidemiological history or out of the context of LB, there is no recommendation to request microbiological tests to determine the state of infection by B. burgdorferi in patients with such disorders if they do not present other clinical manifestations suggestive of LB. The same occurs in children with attention deficits19. We refer the readers may proven fact, although there are controversies regarding the risk of transmission and effects on delivery and fetus140. In 2018, Waddel et al. performed a systematic review of gestational LB and 59 cases were identified from 1969 to 2017141. Twelve cases were associated to miscarriage or fetal death; eight cases, with newborn clinical and laboratory results consistent with studies Lyme pregnancies. The authors concluded that there was no association between gestational LB or surrogate measures of exposure and diagnosis, and seropositive women with no LB were not recovery. Anyway, as facial paralysis observed in a low percentage of treated patients. Time to recovery can be longer in patients with late stages also. These facts should not be with persist for at least months after conventional treatment for LB has been completed 142. s erological tests should not be used as proofs of efficacy of the treatment since despite the fact that antibody titres usually decrease after can seropositive and this fact is often used by some doctors and patients 147. Most Health Agencies and Scientific Societies are against the use of this term, which is commonly used to define patients whom no active infection is demonstrated, and even, in many cases, they never have had B. burgdorferi infection confirmed with tests recommended in this and other for the diagnosis of B. burgdorferi infection. be patients with clinical manifestations of the late phase of LB with evidence of B. burgdorferi infection, infection and LB is based on the demonstration of the presence of the agent in different biological samples by trained staff and continuous quality controls, so they are usually only available in specialized laboratories. In addition, the culture is mainly sensitive in the early phase of the disease, in which the diagnosis is based on the epidemiological history and clinical manifestations. As the infection progresses over time and other organs and systems are affected, the sensitivity decreases. There are -, with incubations between 30- 35\u00baC up to medium (KPM) 148-150. However, this has a in skin samples (biopsies of ACA and arthritis ), and even late stages of the disease (e.g. persistent neurological syndromes). Regarding the visualization of B. burgdorferi s.l., the lack of specific antibodies for the development of immunohistochemistry techniques a lthough direct is mainly based on the tests are not standardized and partial fragments of a variety of is worth -noting that without chromosomal genes is recommended. Since their sensitivity can be lower, the use of two target genes is recommended10. Molecular detection of B. burgdorferi should urine are not suitable materials for diagnosis)157 and in specialized laboratories. PCR assays are useful in patients with skin manifestations, especially with EM, where the sensitivity is around 70%, according to a meta -analysis conducted Rui -Sablji (2017), better profitability in from patients, where the diagnostic reaches 75% 158. However, molecular assays are not worthy in cases of EM since this skin manifestation is very specific and highly valuable the by PCR, with median sensitivity of 77.5%. It decreases up to 22.5% for CSF in neuroborreliosis, and it is 18% or even lower for blood, serum or plasma samples 158. A negative PCR result does not exclude the possibility of LB. The sample longer periods of time is reduced when compared with that of fresh or fresh/frozen specimens 159. The specificity of positive results must be confirmed by identification up to genospecies level to reduce contamination risks. We recommend the use of molecular diagnostic tests in cases of suspicion of neuroborreliosis with CSF, ACA with skin biopsies and LA with synovial fluids, and always laboratories. Indirect diagnoses common accessible diagnostic techniques are the serological ones to demonstrate the presence of antibodies against the causative agent. In this regard, it is worth recalling of antibody response against bite period' presence of antibodies is not detected in the infected individual. In patients who develop EM the first clinical manifestation of the disease, seroconversion occurs between two and four weeks after observation 143,160, being those who present localized EM, without systemic involvement, the ones with the lowest rate. A result not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of BL. For reason, burgdorferi infection, the serological it should be clear that in patients with an EM it is not necessary to confirm the presence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi to make the diagnosis of number of B. burgdorferi proteins that are recognized by individual significantly increases during the course of the disease. In the early stages of infection, the first proteins be IgG infection, IgM occurs in the EM phase only in half of patients in the first two to four weeks of disease development, so 50% of them are negative to this antibody. If the patient progresses towards with associated myalgias and arthralgias), IgM production reaches a peak at six -eight weeks and then gradually lowers the titre after three However, there may be patients who remain IgM positive for a long time (up to ten years after the infection has passed and been correctly treated)164. In addition, IgM in infection by Epstein- women and even in healthy individuals166,167. This is due to some antigens of the bacterium may share epitopes similar to these other infectious agents and to the individual's self-antigens. The development of IgM is followed by an increase in IgG production. This response of polyclonal IgG is directed to numerous of the disease, normally, although not absolutely, IgM turns negative and an increase in IgG is observed compared to a greater number of antigens. For all the above, we do not recommend giving a diagnosis of LB based on an value, in early phases, with typical of the disease and always in adequate epidemiological environment. Thus, support the microbiological EIA: Different techniques use common is ELISA (enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay), and it can be automated, allowing the processing of a large number of samples can be four types: of the VlsE) or pepC10 (extracted from the OspC). The use of sonicates of whole bacterial cells entails the presence of a high number of antigens, many of them of low specificity, which implies a high risk of generating cross -react ions 169-171. Some ELISA tests may mixture antigens with whole cell lysates, which may the early phase of LB while maintaining specificity172,173. With the emergence of new Borrelia spp. as human pathogens in Eur ope (e.g. B. miyamotoi ) the serodiagnosis is even more difficult since ELISA and WB tests designed for the diagnosis of LB may also show cross reactions against B. miyamotoi antibodies Borrelia spp. such as B. mayonii is unknown. Up to our knowledge, this species belonging to the B. burgdorferi s.l. complex has not been found in Europe. In addition, the sensitivity of commercial EIA based EM the sensitivity is 54%, neuroborreliosis it 81%, 96% in arthritis and 97% in ACA. Specificity is generally considered between 90% and 97% in healthy controls 176. 6.2.2. IFA : Another option for the first step of serodiagnosis is the IFA technique. The antigens used are complete bacteria fixed on a slide, alone or in combination with immunodominant antigens, such as VslE or OspC. was the most technique, today it is used less the EIA techniques, since it is not automatable and it is subject to the observer's s ubjectivity (with the consequent lower inter the of cut point is not standardized44. For these reasons, as stated in the German labor atory guidelines178, we do not consider IFA to used for or IFA tests. For its interpretation, qualitative criteria have been proposed bands appear)179 of a quantitative type (assessing not so much the type of bands but the greater or lesser number of them)180 or a combination of both181. The limitations, as with other serological techniques, are that the simple positivity of bands in the WB can indicate a past contact with the microorganism, an active acute infection, a persistent infection, a cross with other microorganisms (particularly in presence of isolated bands against the flagellin protein) , or that the serological diagnosis should be always made under a clinical VlsE protein to the EIA techniques has been proposed in America as a unique and sufficient technique for the microbiologic al diagnosis or as a second confirmation test ignoring the use of a WB 19. In Europe, two- tier laboratory assay strategy based on a highly sensitive first step, followed by a highly specific immunoblot (WB), continues to offer better profitability13,15,18,178. These differences are due to the fact that in Europe the presence of various genospecies involved in LB (B. ELISA C6, unlike in America, where B. burgdorferi s.s. is the only species involved in LB 182. Taking into account the comments and experience, in Europe the recommended serologic of consists of an followed by WB13,15,18,178. It must be mentioned that these tests must be performed only in cases of clinically suspected LB (for patients with signs indicated under the clinical case definitions) in an adequate epidemiological environment, with the exception of EM, to avoid over-testing with the subsequent unnecessary costs 13. This disease. in early LB, whose only manifestation of the disease may be the presence of EM, or in the short -term acute neuroborreliosis, serology can be negative in up to 60% of patients. In these cases, with high suspicion of LB and negative serology results, it is advisable to repeat it in three or four weeks to check if there is seroconversion 18. (Level of consensus: 9/9). A properly treated LB does not preclude from being reinfected after a new tick bite. In these cases, when antibodies from the first infection may continue to exist, serodiagnosis is complicated for the When with possible reinfection with previously positive serology, it new acute phase of reinfection, repeating it four weeks any increase in the antibody titre or modifications in the pattern of WB bands, with respect to the first infection (Consensus level: 9/9). In case of even if positive, it would establish the diagnosis only in a few cases (e.g.: the development of facial paralysi s in a child after a recent bite of I. ricinus in an endemic area should be since on rare occasions patients may show IgG antibodies in the CSF in the absence of a peripheral response. In neuroborreliosis there is a lymphocytic pleocytosis, sometimes the presence plasma cells, finding. The spirochetal invasion of the CNS production a B chemokine in both CSF and serum, and referring it to the total albumin or immunoglobulins G in both samples 111. The formula employed Antibody antibodies in blood serum / Total concentration (mg/L) of IGG en CSF/ Total concentration (mg/L) of IgG in blood serum. An processed for culture and molecular techniques. 6.3 Other techniques for the diagnosis of infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. and LB There are other techniques that have not been approved by any scientific agency or society as valid for the diagnosis of LB and that, for this reason, are discouraged: 6.3.1. Determination of CD57+ CD57+, also a sulfated carbohydrate molecule, with a molecular weight between 100 and 115 kD. It has been defined as a Natural Killer (NK) lymphocyte marker, although it is only expressed in a and is 'exhausted lymphocytes'185. Based on a study by Winger, a low CD57+ cell count (mean 30\u00b116 cells/ml) studied 73 patients with started late antibiotic treatment and found an increase in the count of these cells after therapy However, this in after non -validated control groups, and absence of a clear case and treatment definition. Other researchers, such as Marques et al. found no significant CD57+ between nine patients with post -Lyme syndrome versus 12 patients cur ed of LB and the control group consisting of nine healthy volunteers187. The elevation or decrease of the CD57+ marker has been associated with HIV, B hepatitis, C hepatitis, measles, parvovirus 19 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) been also detected in different types of cancer189. Based on these studies and publications, the CD57 not seem a parameter even symptoms. To date, none studies have proven the usefulness of the release of IFN - from samples of peripheral blood leukocytes that are stimulated with antigen/s of the microorganism, in order to explore the stimulation and activation of lymphocytes B. LB The sensitivity of during the phase of the disease ranges from 36% to 69% 190. In another s tudy in which this test was performed for patients who had a positive ELISA C6 test, sensitivity was increased to 83%191. Also, in this unique verified undergoing antibiotic for no r study has demonstrated the agreement between the serological tests and the concentration of IFN -. The specificity of the test and lack reproducibility has been demonstrated192. The determination of this molecule in other samples (synovial fluid, CSF, skin biopsies, etc.) has not shown it can be a useful diagnostic tool. 6.3.3. IFN- There are . shown an immunopathology of the disease. These same authors demonstrated how treatment did the activated immune should not used in clinical results are expressed based on a Stimulation Index (SI). If the SI is greater than ten, the test is considered positive and if i t is less than ten, negative. At present, no study has been able to demonstrate its clinical utility, known relation to molecule is becoming one of the most promising diagnostic tools. Its greatest usefulness is within the diagnosis of early neuroborreliosis and several studies have demonstrated its elevation in the CSF of these patients194-196. It is detected before the antibodies in the CSF and also its concentration decreases in a sho rt period of time once the antibiotic treatment is established, so it can also be used for monitoring it. It has a sensitivity of 89%-97% and a specificity of 96%. One of its drawbacks is that there is currently no established value as a cut-off point, with each laboratory having its own, so the interpretation can be variable inter -laboratories. Another drawback is that it can also rise in other inflammatory diseases of the CNS viral meningitis, neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis or even lymphoma in CNS, which forces to discard these for a correct interpretation of this marker. This panel recommends this determination for the diagnosis and follow -up of LB with caution until there is no more data and its specificity is better known (Consensu s level: 9/9) chains (kappa lambda) or the determination of total IgM and albumin in the CSF of patients with probable neuroborreliosis. has shown TREATMENT LB has not changed in recent decades and it is based on the treatment of the infection by B. burg dorferi depending on the disease and the organ and/or system affected200,201. To our knowledge, there are no large clinical trials with an appropriate design and enough number of patients to support the recommendations with high level of scientific evidence in some cases, so many recommendations are fundamentally based societies 15,17,19,55,202. The choice of the drug will depend on history allergies, schematically show the drugs and recommended doses in each of the processes associated with LB. We are aware of the controversy with the term \"chronic Lyme\" and its treatment203,204. Since the members of this panel do not consider other LB forms than those developed in the different to conventional treatment, we will not make recommendations on this aspect. Anyway, all the members of this are prolonged treatments with the exceptions that appear in the text for the simple fact of having sometimes patients have to be retreated205-208. Another aspect that we want to highlight is that this panel recommends the use of doxycycline over other therapeutic options, when appropriate. Consideration should be given to the good penetration of this antibiotic into the CNS and other tissues due to the possibility of spirochete ssemination. recently the preferential treatment with intravenous beta- lactams the treatment of neuroborreliosis19, doxycycline can also be considered as an alternative treatment to intravenous beta-lactams for the treatment of CNS infections In fact, in Europe, doxycycline is considered the addition, and of choice against other microorganisms by ticks B. miyamotoi and Rickettsia spp. that are circulating in our environment and are transmitted by I. ricinus . It is only recommended avoiding doxycycline in pregnancy and lactation, when the risk benefit must always be assessed211,212. Regarding the use of doxycycline in children, the American Academic of Pediatrics use of tetracyclines in children younger than eight years has been limited due to the known binding to teeth and bones in young children stain teeth. However, doxycycline, a tooth staining young children'. 'Doxycycline can be used for short durations (e.g. 21 days or less) without regarding patient age'213. Another factor to consider when prescribing an antimicrobial treatment against LB general well the patients different situation. Results may vary between those performed in Europe or in the US, because of the design and to the fact that the Borrelia genospecies involved be different. Anyway, based on clinical trials, the treatment of choice in this situation is an oral regimen with doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil214- 217 as is showed 5. This panel, when no contraindication, preferably recommends the use of doxycycline for 10 -14 days, both in children and adults (Consensus level: 9/9). If chosen, it should be prolonged for of 14 days. The use of macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin erythromycin) as first -line drugs is generally discouraged, leaving them as an alternative cases where doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime cannot be used. In the the use of azithromycin, some authors recommended prolonging the treatment for seven days218. 4 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 10 days (10-21 days) Amoxicillin 500 mg orally TID mg/kg/day axetil 500 mg orally BID 30 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 500 mg per dose) 14 days Azithromycin 500 mg (5-10 days) BID: one doses every12h; TID: used in although a retrospective study of 144 treated The recommended treatment is showed in table 6. It must be considered that there are no consensus among Societies ones recommend 21 days55. The duration in days of treatment recommended in the table should be considered Most patients treated with the recommended regimen present a complete resolution of the signs and symptoms in the following 20 days, avoiding the progression to other phases of the disease. months after treatment. These symptoms usually resolve spontaneously in require sustained or repeated antibiotic treatment, as they are not due to the persistence of the infection. However, if the burgdorferi and LB do not leave permanent immunity and LB may be suffered in more than one occasion (very rare). In that case, the patient will be treated under the same recommended treatment is oral doxycycline for ten to 21 days, with the same considerations made in localized EM. Prolongation of treatment for more than ten days will be based on accompanying signs and symptoms209,211. The doses and duration of the treatment against multiple EM with associated flu- like symptoms and Borrelial lymphocytoma are 4 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 14 days (10-21 days) Amoxicillin 500 mg orally TID mg/kg/day axetil 500 mg orally BID 30 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 500 mg per dose) 14 days Azithromycin 500 mg (5-10 days) BID: one doses every12h; TID: doses been recently published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Academy of Neurology and American Collage of Rheumatology 19, and the European Federation of the Neurology for the treatment of these conditions has been the classic recommendation, and this option continues to be the one recommended by the American guidelines. In Europe, the new guidelines recommend the use of oral doxycycline as long as there are no parenchymal complications at the brain or spinal level or the clinical manifestations are very severe 210. The recommended treatment for isolated facial paralysis without signs of meningeal involvement is oral doxycycline for a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 28 days, although a clinical trial did not show differences in the response related to the duration of treatment 222. In any case, as specified in previous paragraphs, the history of treatment should last neurological manifestations of the early phase, and as an alternative, a beta- lactam by intravenous route at the doses and with the duration specified in the table 7. In case of parenchymal involvement, the recommended treatment is an intravenous or without associated meningitis polyradiculoneuropathy 4 mg/kg/day orally in 2 divided doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 14 days (14-28 Ceftriaxone* 2 Penicillin G* 20 doses 200,000 -400,000 U/kg/day IV divided in 6 doses (maximum 20 million/day) 14 days (14-28 day) BID: one doses every 12h; OD: one stages of the disease does not require antimicrobial treatment different from that of the process itself. for the duration specified in Table 8. This can be route with symptomatic bradycardia that cannot be managed the use of degree AV-B with PR >300 ms or 2/3 degree AV myocarditis. Adult dose Child 4 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 14 days (14-21 days) Amoxicillin 500 mg orally TID mg/kg/day axetil 500 mg orally BID 30 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 500 mg per dose) 14 days (14-21 doses every12h; TID: one doses every 8h; OD: one doses every 24h. Treatment of the other accompanying the 7. 7.3 Late phase 7.3.1. Arthritis In the case of arthritis, to prolong treatment with oral doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for up to 28 days at the doses specified in table 9 is recommended. Some patients with sustained synovitis refractory to antibiotic 4 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 28 days 28 showed in Table 10. Doxycycline or amoxicillin for 30 days are the recommended ones55. When ACA is accompanied by involvement of the 4 mg/kg/day orally in two divided doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 28 days Amoxicillin 500 mg orally TID 50 mg/kg/day orally in every12h; TID: one doses 8h; doses Late very rare and avoidable with effective treatment in previous stages of the disease. conditions with ceftriaxone for three weeks 123. The same therapeutic option is recommended by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), although they not specify the duration recommend French guidelines recommend doxycycline and ceftriaxone as an alternative for three weeks15. This panel, as in the previous sections, chooses to recommend doxycycline as the first ceftriaxone as an alternative depending on the severity of the clinical picture and (e.g.: ACA polyneuropathy), 4 mg/kg/day orally divided in two doses (maximum 100 mg per dose) 21 days (14-21days) Ceftriaxone* 2 one doses every12h; OD: one doses every 24h. * In case of coexistence of ACA, 28 days. 7.4. Post -Lyme syndrome. Chronic Lyme borreliosis. the recommendations established in the text, allows the control of the infection with cure for a very high percentage of patients. For patients treated in the early phase of the disease, cure usually occurs within three weeks whereas in the late- phase of the disease, the ic treatment may fail, although this situation is rare and it is usually due to problems with adherence or absorption For patients with the post or out guideline. some authors advocate prolonging treatment in case of persistence of symptoms evidence of this panel, until there is more scientific evidence, and since the persistence of B. burgdorferi infection after adequate treatment has not been demonstrated, are not to prolonged treatments or persistent inespecific symtoms of different diseases. This could based on pre-exposition measures to avoid the bite of the vector and post-exposition measures. 8.1. Pre-exposition measures The best method to avoid LB is preventing tick bites. In the table 12, the general I. ricinus activity in Spain 231. In case of going to the countryside, being keeping to the center of trails could minimize contact with adjacent vegetation where ticks abundant. The use of protective clothing that limits the contact of ticks with the body can be very effective to avoid tick attachment. It detect the long trousers tucked into the socks, long-sleeved shirt tucked into do or unattached tick-bite as well as washing clothes in hot water dry clothing high outdoor activities. Bathing or permethrin19,231. All of them can be applied to both skin and clothing, except permethrin which must be only applied to clothing due to its toxicity. When clothes clothing be effective weeks concentration over lower concentrations236. DEET, which available in a wide variety of topical formulas providing up to 12 hours of protection, has been shown to be the most effective and with the broadest spectrum repellent19. Despite these products p certain toxicity. fact has misguided in garlic, citronella, lavender (e.g., citriodiol or p- menthane- 3,8-diol available on the market as a tick repellent) but there is not enough evidence and their effectiveness has to be demonstrated. The Spanish Association of Pediatrics as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP)237 and the CDC only recommend DEET for children at least two months of age, although it is desirable to be avoided as much as possible in children under two years of age 238. The American Association of Pediatrics and the CDC do not recommend OLE and PMD for children <three years of age19. The contact between humans and parasitized domestic animals of these guidelines. Vaccines for preventing LB were developed in past and only available in USA but to date commercial vaccines are not available for humans 241,242. New technologies Educational programs could be a good tool acquiring that instruct in the prevention of tick Do not go off the trail when walking in areas where there are ticks. Use clothes that cover exposed areas of the body (cap, long trousers tucked into the socks, long Inspect the body after being in outdoor where ticks are abundant. Remove in circumstances after tick-bite. Observe the site of the tick attachment for up to six weeks. 8.2. Post -exposition measures If a patient is bitten by a tick, we must proceed to extract it and the painless, making important to do an exhaustive exploration of the entire body in order to look for any attached ticks and remove them. Removal of the attached ticks must be done as soon as possible since it is accepted that 36-48 hours for B. burgdorferi transmission are needed, and the risk increases with longer attachments. Some European studies suggest the transmission of B. burgdorferi within 24 hours of attachment of I. ricinus ticks 244,245. The use of tweezers or force remove ticks significantly decreases the risk of complications associated -bite or the infection grasp the mouth straight upward with steady pressure, perpendicular to the skin 247. Other tick removal devices have been shown being useful for removing ticks248-251. If after the extraction any part of the tick is retained in the skin it should be advisable to perform a biopsy of the inoculation place in order to avoid a neurotoxic paralysis due to the presence of the arthropod salivary glands and the neurotoxin in the patient when bite is close to a nerve structure 252. Nevertheless, last American Guidelines Treatment should be left alone and permitted to fall out19. After removing the tick from the area, it should be detection or isolation of the causative case Other popular methods among others, are the tick and use forceps for the 72 hours of exposure, is common practice in US and has been evaluated in different clinical to adults 72 hours of removal if the tick bite was from an identified Ixodes spp., if it occurred in a highly endemic area, and if the tick was attached for 36 hours19. The preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis is the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline (200 mg for adults and 4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg for children) within 72 hours of tick removal over observation. In this case, it has been weighed the likelihood of disease and This fact has been not extensible for European countries where it is not recommended with the argument that it will be necessary to perform 40- 125 prophylaxes for preventing one borreliosis 255, and the impact on the intestinal flora and a possible development of resistance is conceivable17. Anyway, trial that would extending this to open- label, randomized, controlled trial, administering a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline within 72 h after removing an attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment in people older than eight years resulted in a relative risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 31 - 84%). No serious adverse events were reported. Since we do not have data from Spain and considering that it is a sunny area, a reasonable option might be to consider that when the tick been manipulated, the tick is engorged or the patient has a high level of anxiety, of doxycycline versus In case, suffering tick bite, it is advisable to instruct the patients in the possible signs and symptoms that they may develop and they should at least observe the point of the bite for least six weeks (Consensus no conflict of interest in the writing of this article. 2.
